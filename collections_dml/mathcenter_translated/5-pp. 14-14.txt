Solving the degree of Riemann for quasi -periodic functions, let R = {Z e C 1 z = ti + s1w1 + s2w2, o <s1, s2 <1} is the inside of the parallelogram, IM (w2 /w1) o, 11, /~ - it Bas, 12, l ~ - lower and upper foundations. Let DR - the boundary of the region R, oriented counterclockwise ki, l = {z e s l lzl = 1}, l with r - the circumference is oriented clockwise. Through L+, we denote the double on the fin with the border fjd+ = l u dr, and through l -= r \ d+ - one coherent. It is required to find all function f (z), analytical in r \ l, not discontinuous in d ±, and; marks the final number of zeros, according to the boundary conditions: [f+(t)] a = g (t) (f- (t) )], c, t e l \ !. 1, (1) f+(t+'"-k) = f-+-(t) exp (/k), t e lk, k = 1, 2 , (2) where about :, (3 e s \ {}, "/k e s, g (t) · · gelderov function on l, g (t) #o,! 1 = {tje, points TJ e l is arbitrarily fixed, since the functions of the functions f (z) are the condition (1) should be in such a way that there are branches of LN f ± (t) on L \! 1, in which EXP [ci jn f is performed + (t)] = g (t) EHR [, 8 ln f- (t)]. An anal continuation of the functions [f+ (t)] a, [f- (t)], in the semi-precision of the point T1 not Required. Protected behavior in the vicinity of TJ: where F 'T (Z) is limited and not turned to zero at the semi -reckoning of the point TJ, Re (AJ/A)> O, Re (A1/F3)> O, OTJ = MJ + 0TK1 +, 811, MJ, KI, 11 E Z. The criterion of resolving and the solution is apparent. The analysis of the Usjuvius of resolution, depending on the number of zeros of the solution and their location. 14
