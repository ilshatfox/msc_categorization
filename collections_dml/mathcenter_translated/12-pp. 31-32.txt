Class S2 operator for Hoff-Sabadosh based on the nucleus of Butzer A-ST Arca E.M. Ershov Tver State Physeni1 Upwegestet E-mail: Elena. Ershova@tversu.ru p. Butzer and E.

The resulting operator brings closer Four times differentiary functions with the order O (p-4). We build on the basis of the same nucleus the operator LN (F, x) of class 52 according to the Hoff-Sabadosh method (C111.

This means that the operator we built brings the differentowed functions no worse than the operator Butzer-Stark. 31 Literature 1. But. Ier p .l "Stark E .l.
