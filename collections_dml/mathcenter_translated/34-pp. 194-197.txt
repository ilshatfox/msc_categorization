One non -linear singular integral equation with the Koshi nucleus on the material axis I. N. Tikhonov Kazan State University, forviking@yandex.ru in this note in the continuation of a number of results [1-3] are the methods for solving a non -linear syngular integral equation of Ax ≡ λf ( t, x (t) (t)) + µφ (t, x (t), sx) = y (t), (1) where the singular integral is sx = s (x; t) = 1 π mm∫ −mm h (t, t, t. τ) x (τ) dτ τ τ - t, –ura <t <mm, (2) is understood in the sense of the main value of the cat - a leaf [4]; Here λ and µ are arbitrary material parameters, f (t, u), h (t, u) and φ (t, u, v) - known material continuous functions of their arguments, and y (t) and x (t) ∈ L2 - respectively specified and desired functions. Through L2 = L2 (R), we denote the hyilbert space of the functions quadratically sum are on R = (− least, φ) according to the lebe with the scalar work and the norm, respectively (∗, ψ) = (lus, ψ) l2 = 1 π وges- Φ onic (t) ψ (t) dt, ‖ship, = ‖ices ‖ {1 π φ∫ −mm | onic (t) | 2 dt} 1/2, ∗, ψ ∈ L2. 196 Let the functions f (t, u) and φ (t, u, v) and parameters λ and µ are attracted by the following conditions: (a) | f (t, u) - f (t, u1) | 6 m1 | u - u1 |, (b) λ [f (t, u) - f (t, u1)] (u - u1)> λm1 | u - u1 | 2, (c) | φ (t, u , v) - φ (t, u1, v1) | 6 m2 | u - u1 | +M3 | v - v1 |, (g) µ [φ (t, u, v) - φ (t, u1, v)] (u - u1)> µm2 | u - u1 | 2, (e) | h | h (t, u) - h (t, u1) | 6 m4 | u - u1 | for any t, u, v, u1, v1 ∈ R and some M1, m2 ∈ R; M1, M2, M3, M4 ∈ R+. In addition, without restriction of community, we assume that (e) λf (t, 0) + µφ (t, 0, 0) = 0. Theorem 1. Let the conditions (a) - (e), where m ≡ | λ are fulfilled | M1 + | µ | (m2 + m3m4) <mm, m ≡ λm1 + µm2 - | µ | m3m4> 0. Then the equation (1) - (2) has the only solution x ∗ (t) ∈ L2 in any right part y (t) ∈ L2, and the assessment of M - 1‖y‖ 6 ‖ ∗ ‖ 6 m - 1‖y‖ are fair. Theorem 2. In the conditions of theorem 1, the only solution x ∗ (t) ∈ L2 equations (1) - (2) can be found as the limit in L2 ITSENTIONS XI = XI-1 + M m2 (y –axi - 1), i = I = I = I = 12, . . . , with any initial approximation x0 (t) ∈ L2. For the error of the i-hut XI (t), the assessment ‖x ∗-XI‖ 6 Qi (1-q) −1‖x1-x0‖ (i ∈ N), 197 where Q = √ 1-(m/m) are fair 2 <1. If the initial approximation is selected according to the formula x0 = mm-2Y, then the error of the i-hut can be estimated in the space of L2 non-crowning ‖X ∗-XI‖ 6 Q I+1-Q m m2 ‖y‖, i ∈ N. We denote through {wor (t)} و the complete orthonormal system of functions in L2, and through CR (F) = (F, ivil) - the coefficients of the function f (t) ∈ L2 according to the specified system. The approximate solution of the equation (1) - (2) will be searched in the form of the function XN (t) = n∑ k = 1 αk accord (t), n ∈ N, (3) unknown coefficients {αk = αk, n} n1 of which are determined from systems of nonlinear algebraic equations (SNAU) CR (a n∑ k = 1 αk accord) = Cr (y), r = 1, n, n ∈ N. (4) theorem 3. Under conditions any n ∈ N. The approximate solutions (3) converge in L2 to the exact solution x ∗ (t) equations (1) - (2), and for the error of the approximate formula x ∗ (t) ≈ xn (t), t ∈ R , n ∈ N, the bilateral assessments of EN (x ∗) 6 ‖ ∗ - xn‖ 6 m --1men (x ∗), n ∈ N are true in order, where EN (x ∗) is the best medium -term approximation of the X ∗ ( t) ∈ L2 with all kinds of elements of the type (3). Comment. The results similar to the above occur in the case when the functions f, h, φ, x and y are intensified, and the parameters λ, µ and space L2 are complex. 198 l and t e r a t r a 1.
