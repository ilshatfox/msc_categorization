The task of the Koshi for one B -Parabolic equation, let the first quarter x> o, t> about the coordinate plane OXT; L + - half -falls in BT +, limited interva scrap f (o) = {x = o, o, o <t <t} and half -rendering g = {x> o, t = o} in = {x> o, t = t} ; L+ = l+ u n, l+ = l+ u g. In this work, the task of Koshi is considered about finding even by a limited solution to the Equation of DI ::: 2 and 2 and+ ~ di, k> 0 dx2 x dx dx dx dx dx dx In L +, satisfying the initial condition ult = o = <p (x), x e g, where IP (x) is an even function. The theorem is proved (1) (2). If Fuikv, Iya and E C (L+) NC2 (L+), Construction by X, fragmented u. Satisfies in l+ equalism (1), u (x, t) accepts Jabol and 'Na, ". The unity of this theorem is proved by the uniqueness of the solution of the problem of the Koshi (1), (2) . 65 .: IA. PEE, the integraj1ly1 · 0 transformation of Furye-Bessel [1] is a formal solution to the problem of Koshi (1), (2). It has a type (3) where 1 .., (t) the function of the submissive argument of the VO GO order. It is proved that the function and (x, t) determined by Integra.rum (3) is a solution to the problem of Koshi (J), (2). Literature 1. Kipriyanov I.A.// Tr. ; ... 1AT.

In this work, the task of Koshi is considered to find even even by the solution of the equation D2 and D2 and P -1 DI D 2 = D 2 + ---- D.
