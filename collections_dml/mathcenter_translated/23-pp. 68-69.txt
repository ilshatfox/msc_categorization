Steel analogues of some cell rings we consider the matrix linear surgery m = m (x, k) above the field k [1] and the right action of the group G on the set X. On this action, you can build homomorphism Opead a: kg → m, such that a ( G1,., GM) (X1... XM, Y) = ΔX1G1, Y. . . Δxmgm, y (kg (m) = k [g m]; this operating is studied in [1]). We denote through HX, G (M) the many of all such C S (M) that A (G). . . A (g) c = ca (g) for any g ∈ G. Then hx, g = {hg, x (m) | m = 1, 2 ,. . .} There is a suboperda m. This design is an operational generalization of the algebra of the adjacency (cell rings) of the relations of relations considered in [2], p. 4 ) G (m) | M = 1, 2,. . .}, where (kx) g (m) = {w ∈ K [xm] | wg = w for all g ∈ G}. In particular, albeit g = σn (a group of substances of the nth degree), x-a free switching half-group with the basis X1 ,. . . , XN, and the action G on X is such that XIσ = xσ (I). Then kx (m) ∼ = k [x1.1 ,. . . , x1, n,. . . , XM, 1,. . . , xm, n], and (kx) σn = λn, m - a ring of multisimetric functions [3]. Consider in kx (m) ideal I (m), generated by all differences ∏ i, j x ki, j - ∏ i, j x si, j, j, somewhere ki, j = si, j, or ki, j ≡ Si, J (Mod 2). Then I = {I (M) | M = 1, 2,. . .} There is the ideal of the KX operates, and the σn group acts on (kx/i) (m). We denote through λ (2) n, m under the ring of the ring (kx/i) (m), consisting of elements that are motionless relative to the action σn. Then λ (2) n = {λ (2) n, m | m = 1, 2 ,. . .} is Opa 70 Rada. Let y = {± 1} n, σn acts on Y with a rearrangement of the component, g - the half -rejection work y and σn. Group G naturally acts on y on the right. Theorem. Hy, g ∼ = λ (2) n ∼ = (ky) σn.

The degree of Deg (l) of the estimated linear order l = 〈ω, <l〉 is called the turing degree of such a predicate r (x, y), which x <l y) is called and only when R (x, y). We introduce the following classes of linear degrees: spectrum spec (l) = {deg (l ′) | L ′ ∼ = l} and ∆02-spectrum spec ∆02 (l) = spec (l) ∩∆02. Theorem 1.
