. One isoperimetric inequality for the single -link regions of the Salahudins R.G. Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.G. Chebotareva of Kazan State University Let D C C - a single -link region, R (Z, D) - Conformer radius of the region D at point Z. Consider the two functionality of the areas introduced in [1) and [2]: the maximum of the conformal radius of the region R (D) = maxr (z, d); ZED Conformed moment of inertia of the region D from the determination of the functionals and the presentation of the conformal moment in the form of an infinite row follows the inequality {1) 251 seconds ~ Akhudinov R. G. One isperimetric inequality ... The equal sign is achieved only when area D is a certain circle. We denote through C (D) the rigidity of the area D.F.Avhadiev [2) proved that C (D) "'Iya (D), and received the following grades II (D) ~ C (D) ~ 41YA (D ). In this work, the result was obtained, which enhances the left inequality, as well as the previous result of the author [Z]. The following statement is true. Theorem. For any single -link area D, there is an inequal one (d) ~ c (d). (D). (D). 2) the equal sign is realized only in the case when D is a certain circle. Thus, the totality of inequalities (1) and (2) enhances the isopa rimetric inequality 1g4 (d) ~ 2c (d), proven by the city of Polia and G.Sege ( 1). The work was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Federation Project N 9601-00110. Literature 1. LIA G., Sege G. Isperimetric inequalities in mathematical physics. M.
