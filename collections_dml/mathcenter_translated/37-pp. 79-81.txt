The study of one task of determining the voltage of the magnetic field of a given configuration methods of creating electromagnetic fields of a given configuration play an important role in solving various applied problems [1, 2]. In a quasi -stationary magnetic approximation, the equation for determining the voltage of the magnetic field can be written in the form of [3, 4]: 4πµσ C ∂h (x, t) ∂t + Rot Roth (X, T) = 4πσ C ROT Veste (X, T) (1) div h (x, t) = 0, [h (x, t)] τ = 0, x ∈ γ = ∂ω, h (x, t) | t = 0 = h0 (x), x ∈ ω ⊂ R3, H (X, Tfix), E ST (x, tfix): ω → R3, µ, σ-const> 0, where H is the magnetic field strength vector, is a given vector-function, which is often considered specified by an electromagnetic field, which is not an electromagnetic nature by origin; In the future, we will consider the Isaader 80 a field chisel, C is the speed of light in a vacuum, µ is the magnetic permeability of the medium, σ is the specific conductivity of the medium. The system (1) is considered in the area Qt = ω × [0, T]. The following spaces are introduced in the report: v 1.0 2 (qt) = {u ∈ {l2 (qt)} 3: rotu ∈ {l2 (qt)} 3, div u = 0} with a scalar work (u, v) V. (Qt) = ∫ ω t∫ 0 [(u, v) + (Rotu, Rot)] DX DT and O V 1.0 2 (QT) as a closure in v 1.0 2 (Qt) smooth functions, equal zero in the vicinity of the side surface of the cylinder Qt. The concept of a generalized solution of h [is, t) of the task (1) corresponding to the source of the field is introduced, and theorems of its existence and uniqueness in the class O v 1.0 2 (Qt) are proved. The results are planned to be used in the future to solve the reverse problem of creating an electromagnetic field of a given configuration, the essence of which is to find the Source of the field of the isom, in which the electromagnetic field will have at the time of time t = t a given configuration h (x, t) ≡ h̄ (x) . To solve this problem, it is planned to use the dual regulatory algorithm [6, 7]. I thank the scientific advisers of Associate Professor A.V. Kalinin and Professor M.I.
