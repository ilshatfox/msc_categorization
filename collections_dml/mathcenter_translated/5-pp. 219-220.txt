) Two -dimensional integral equations of the Abel type with one appel function in the nuclei. We consider a two -dimensional integral equation of the Abe La type, the core of which, in addition to the steppe feature, contain the function of the Annel P2: (1) 219 where about <re11 <1, o <re12 <1, g (x1, x2) e As ([a1, b1] x [a2, b2]), aibi;: = :: o, i = 1, 2. Uranition (1) at (31 = 11 using the formula of bringing [ 1] You can reduce to the equation (A, 111 81) (A:,/321 82)! () D D X2F1. 1 - 2F1 1 - 81 '82 81 82 = 11 x1 12: x2 g (x1, xz ). (2) Equation (2) is considered in the work [2] and its solution has the type of literature 1. Beitman G., Erdeyi A. The highest transcendental functions. Hypergeometry, ethnic function.
