Novikov IPM RAS RAS, Izhevsk 1 Introduction, when solving regional problems by the method of final elements, sparse systems of linear algebraic equations AU = F, A ∈ RN × N, U SHN, F SER RN arise. (1.1) The matrix of the coefficients A and the vector of the right part F of the system (1.1) in this case are formed as follows [1]: a = m∑ e = 1 cte aece, (1.2) f = m∑ e = 1 cte Fe, (1.3 ) 127 Parallel schemes of the method of conjugated gradients where M is the number of finite elements, ae ∈ Rn × N, CE ∈ Zn × N, Fe ∈ Rn, N is the number of unknown one finite element. The CE of CE of CE of the final element E [2] is a matrix, determined as follows: CE is a rectangular matrix n × n, moreover, cij = 1, if the unknown J is the I-th unknown final element, and cij = 0 in another case. Expressions (1.2), (1.3) can be recorded in another way [3]: a = ct ãc, (1.4) f = ct f̃, (1.5) where ã ∈ Rn1 × n1, f̃ ∈ Rn1, C ∈ Zn1 × N, N1 = n · m. Matrix ã = [AII]-block-diagonal matrix with blocks AII = AE, C T = [CT1, C T 2 ,. . . , C t m], cti = c t e, i, e = 1, 2 ,. . . , M. We introduce the vectors obtained according to the following rule: x̄ = cx, x̄ ∈ Rn1, x ∈ Rn, (1.6) and the scalar product xt y = (ct x̃) tct ỹ = x̃tcct ỹ = x̃t ȳ. (1.7) The method of calculating scalar works through vectors (1.6), different from (1.7), was introduced in the work [3]. When using it, an error associated with the presentation of endless fractions in the final arithmetic computers may accumulate. 2 The algorithm of the method of conjugated gradients for systems (1.1) of a large dimension with a positively defined matrix of the coefficients used the method of conjugated gradients (MSG). Various versions of this method are considered in many works, for example, [1], [3] - [9]. Having taken as the basis of the formulas for MSG from [6] and taking into account (1.2) - (1.7), we get ã ∈ RN1 × N1, f̃, r̃, r̄, q̃, q̄, p̄, ∈ ∈ Rn1, α, ρ, ρ, γ , ε ∈ R1; - Initialization: ū0 = 0, r̃0 = f̃ - ūū0, r̄0 = ct r̃0, p̄0 = r̄0, ρ0 = r̃t0 r̄0. 128 M.Yu.

(2.11) This algorithm allows you to solve the system of equations without forming it in canonical form (1.1). 3 Parallel schemes of MSG when solving regional problems on multiprocessor computer expression (1.2), (1.3) have the form a = p∑ i = 1 m∑ e = 1 cte aece, f = p∑ i = 1 m∑ e = 1 cte fe , (3.1) where P is the number of computers. For the use of block parallelization in MSG [8], [9], it is necessary to assemble the matrix of the coefficients A and the vector of the right part F, divide the blocks and send the blocks to computing computers of computers (hereinafter refers). Unlike [8], [9] in the subsequently considered scheme (see also [10]), the breakdown is characterized in that the breakdown into the blocks of the matrix of the coefficients and vectors is set to display a final -element mesh to the computer nodes network. This algorithm is based on the diagram (2.1) - (2.11) and equations (1.4) - (1.5) recorded in the form a = p∑ i = 1 cti ãiici, f = p∑ i = 1 cti f̃i, (3.2) 129 parallel The schemes of the method of conjugated gradients where ãII = [AII] ∈ RN2 × N2, AII = AE, CI ∈ ZN2 × N, CI = [CI], CI = CE, I = 1, 2. . . , N2, e = n2 (i -1) +1, N2 (i -1) +2 ,. . . , N2 · i, f̃i ∈ Rn2, n2 = n1/p. Let the XI be a vector placed in the computing node I, that that x = p∑ i = 1 XI, where XI, X ∈ RN. Then it can be represented in the form of the amount belonging to the node I (internal) and common for several components of the terms: XI = C T I (X̃ Com I + X̃ in I) + Pi∑ J = 1 XEXIJ, (3.3) where cti x̃ com i is general components belonging to the node I; C t i x̃ in i - internal components; Pi∑ j = 1 xExij - the sum of external components from the Uz, adjacent to I; Pi - the number of adjacent from the I nodes; x ex Ij = c t j x̃ com ji; CTI, C T J - parts C T, corresponding to units of nodes I and J. Accordingly, x̄i = cixi, x̄i ∈ Rn2, ci ∈ Zn2 × n. Calculating ρk+1 through (r̃k - αkq̃k, r̄k - αk q̄k) and taking into account (3.3), we get the following scheme: ãii ∈ RN2 × N2, f̃i, r̃i, q̃i, q̄i, p̄i, ūi ∈ Rn2, αi, βi , ρi, γi, α, β, ρ, γ, ε ∈ R1. - Initialization: ū0i = 0, r̃0i = f̃i - ãii ū0i, r0i = c t i r̃0i + pi∑ j = 1 rex0ij, r̄0i = cir0i, p̄0i = r̄0i, ρ0i = r̃ t 0i r̄0i, ρ0 = p∑ i = 1 ρ0i. 130 M.Yu.
