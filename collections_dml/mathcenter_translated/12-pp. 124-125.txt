The task of electrochemical shaping, taking into account the localization zone m. Shaidullin Kazan State University E-Mail: msatsfzaidillim'@ksu.ru in this work by the theory of the functions of the commercial transformation solves the problem of finding the anode border, taking into account the area of ​​the tool cathode and the non-created metal. To solve the problem, we introduce a Comiuiyx potassium cyl (Z) = RP + I 1/1 of the zlesttatic field, where - the potential .., and 124 of this field, ({j - the function of the electric field. The boundary conditions of mi for w (z) will be boundary : = O at the border of the AMNBC2C1D; = 1 on D D at the border E1E2D; ({j = o on AE1; condition dw /dt = cosb stascos2 of the process of processing processing x E1 @, on the desired boundary amnb, rd () - the angle of inclination of Kas A Telnaya (Fig. 1). To solve the problem, the Method of Fig. 1 of the speed of the speed is used. During the solution, a system of seven nonlinear equations was obtained. Research methods of solving this system.

Shirabutdinov Kazansj. : and state university examined the tasks of behavior in Progue rods and circular qi lindric shells under the influence of a proda; rnoro pulse of force. It is believed that force is applied to the end instantly and remains in a given period of time. The movement of OPE elements is boiled by a system of wave differential equations, teach 125
