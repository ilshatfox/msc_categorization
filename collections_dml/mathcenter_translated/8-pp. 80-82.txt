Comment. In the servant of ordinary LP space, similar results in other terms were obtained in the work [2], [3]. 81 Work was supported by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (project E -00-1-66) and RFFIF (project 01-01-00992).

Let Tω - marked Thor with the generators 1 and ω, IM ω> 0, α = arg ω; Γm, n is the homotopic class of closed curves on tω, performing m turns along and n - across the torah handle, λm, n - the extreme length of the family γm, n. Theorem 1 [1]. The values ​​of the extreme lengths λ1.0 and λ0.1 of families γ1.0 and γ0.1 on the Torah Taver are λ1.0 = 1 | ω | sin α λ0.1 = | ω | sin α, respectively.
