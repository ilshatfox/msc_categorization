Materials of the International School-Conference of UDC 514.822 Inequalities such as Brunna-Minkovsky for generalized sedate moments with additional multipliers B.S. Timergaliev1 1 Timergalievbs@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky, the real work is devoted to the construction of classes of new regions in the Euclidean space and evidence for them inequalities such as Brunnaminovsky. Keywords: Brunna-Minkovsky inequality, concave functionality, steppe moments. The classic inequality of Brunna-Minkovsky has the following type: | ω0 +ω1 | 1/n ≥ | ω0 | 1/n +| ω1 | 1/n, (1) where | ω | - the measure of the set of PITA, ω0, ω1 - convex bodies in RN, ω0+ω1: = {z0+z1 ∈RN: z0 ∈ ω0, z1 ∈Ly} - vector amount. In 1887, inequality (1) was obtained by Brunnoy in case of n = 3. In 1910, Minkovsky pointed to Brunna to a mistake in the evidence that he corrected, and also came up with his evidence. Both Brunn and Minkovsky showed that equality is achieved when and only when ω0 and ω1 are equal with accuracy until transfer and expansion. For a long time it was believed that the inequality of Brunn-Minkovsky refers only to geometry, where its significance is widely known. But in the middle of the 20th century L.A. Lesterin [1] proved that inequality (1) is true for arbitrary limited measurable sets ω0 and ω1, in this case it is customary to call him the general inequality of Brunn-Minkovsky. In 1954, H. Hadwiger and Okman [2] gave new evidence of Brunnaminkovsky inequality. Since then, inequality began its path to the field of analysis. The last 30-40 years, the topic related to the inequality of Brunn-Minkovsky has been developing rapidly. Inequality is widely used in geometric analysis, mathematical physics and probability theory. Literature on inequalities such as Brunn-Minkovsky and the main results that appeared until 2006 are contained in review articles [3], [4]. Our interest in this topic is associated with the results of the Australian mathematician G. Kadi [5], who in 2007 proved the inequality of the Brunn-Minkovsky type for the functionality introduced by F.G. Avhadiev [6]. The development of the result of G. Kadi, as well as inequalities for new types of functionals, were obtained in work [7-10]. It is also interesting to summarize the results of H. Hadwiger [11], who proved in 1956 the inequality of the Brunn-Minkovsky type for two moments of the convex region, namely, the moment regarding the center of the masses and the moment relative to hyperpravianness. We give the wording of the result H. Hadwiger [11]. Let ω is a limited, convex region in RN. Through S, we denote the center of the mass B.S. Timergaliev 355 regions ω. Determine the functionality J (ω) = ˆ ω (| z1 - S1 | 2 +| z2 - s2 | 2 +... +| zn - SN | 2) D Z1 ... D Zn, Z ∈, where Z1, where Z1, where z1 Z2, ..., zn - the decartons of the coordinates of the point z ∈, S1, S2, ..., SN are the coordinates of the center of mass ω. The following theorem 1 (Hadwiger) is fair. Let theω0, ω1 - limited, convex areas in RN. Then, for the functionality J (ωt) 1 n+2, the inequality is true: j (ωt) 1 2+n ≥ (1– t) j (ω0) 1 2+n+t j (ω1) 1 2+n, (1) where ωt = {(1– t) z0 + t z1 | z0 ∈ω0, z1 ∈ω1}, 0 ≤ T ≤ 1. The purpose of this work is the generalization of inequality (1). We build three classes of functionals for which the inequality of the type of Brunn-Minkovsky is fair. 1. Let ω is a limited area in RN, presented in the form of a unification by the unnecessary number of convex areas. We determine the functionality I (k, ω) = ˆ ω (α1 | x1 - s1 | k +α2 | x2 - s2 | k +·, · +αn | xn - sn | k) d x, k ∈ (0, +urb) where S1, S2 ,. . . , SN - the coordinates of the minimum of the function I (y) = ˆ ω (α1 | x1 - y1 | k +α2 | x2 - y2 | k +·, · +αn | xn - yn | k) d x, d x = d x1d x2 · · · D xn variables y = (y1, y2,., Yn) ∈Rn; X1, X2,. . . , xn - the decartons of the coordinates of the point x ∈ ω, k ∈ (0,+∞), αi> 0, (I = 1.2,., N) - arbitrary real numbers. With k = 2, the minimum point is s = (s1,., SN) coincides with the center of the mass of the region ω and the dentition J = 1, (j = 1, n) we obtain the functionality considered by H. Hadwiger B [2]. With k ̸ = 2, the point of the minimum s function I (y), generally speaking, does not coincide with the center of mass of the region ω. Note that the point of the minimum S belongs to the N-dimensional parallelepippe with the ribs [min Xorn x j, max xuss x j], j = 1, n, x = (x1, x2,., XN), therefore hyperploster X J J. = s j, j = 1, n have a non -empty intersection with the area ω. Theorem 2. Let ω0, ω1 - limited areas in RN, presented as the volume of the final number of convex areas. Then the functionality i (k, ω) 1/(k+n) is injected: i (k, ωt) 1/(k+n) ≥ (1– t) i (k, ω0) 1/(k+n)++ T I (k, ω1) 1/(k + n), where ωt = {(1– t) z0 + t z1 | z0 ∈ω0, z1 ∈ω1}, 0 ≤ T ≤ 1, k ∈ (0,+urb). 2. Let ω is a limited area in RN, presented in the form of a unification by the unnecessary number of convex areas. We determine the functionality W (k, ω) = ˆ ω (α1 | X1-S1 | K +α2 | X2-S2 | K +· MALSE +αN | XN-SN | K) M D X, 356 Materials of the International School-Conference where S1 where s1 , s2 ,. . . , SN - the coordinates of the minimum of the function w (y) = ˆ ω (α1 | x1 - y1 | k +α2 | x2 - y2 | k +·,, · +αn | xn - y - y - y
