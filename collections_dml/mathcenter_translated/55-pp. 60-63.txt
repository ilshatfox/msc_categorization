UDC 517.956.25 The existence of entropy solutions of anisotropic elliptical equations with variable indicators of non -linearity in Rn A.Sh. Kamaletdinov1, L.M.

The existence of entropy solutions in the anisotropic spaces of Sobolev with variables has been proven. It was established that the constructed entropy solution is a renormalized solution to the problem under consideration. Keywords: anisotropic elliptic equation, variable indicator of nonlinearity, entropy solution, renormalized solution. For elliptical equations with the degree non-linearies and the L1-right part in [1], the concept of the entropy solution of the problem of the Dirichla problem was proposed and its existence and unity were proved. In this work, the existence of entropy solutions in the space rn = {x = (x1, x2, xn)}, n ≥ 2, for a certain class of elliptical equations with variables of non -linearities n∑ i = 1 (x, x, is proven. u, ∇u)) xi - | u | p0 (x) −2u −b (x, u, ∇u) = f (x), x ∈Rn, (1) A.Sh.
