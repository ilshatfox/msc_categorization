UDC 517.53 On the best approximation of the degree function in the space of Bergman V.P. Misyuk1 1 misiuk@grsu.by; Grodno State University named after Yankees Kupala, Grodno, Belarus in the article considers the question of the best approximation of the degree function in the space of Bergman. Key words: the best polynomial approximation, direct theorems, Bergman's space. Let S - the hidden of the jordan (simple or closed) curve in the complex plane C. For 0 <p ≤ mm, we denote the space of the lebe of the integrated on S relative the linear measure of the lebe with the usual quasinore ∥LP (s) ∥ (the norm at 1 ≤ p ≤ least). Namely, f ∈ LP (s), if ∥ f ∥p = ∥ f ∥lp (s): =   ˆ d ∣∣ f (ă) ∣∣p | dă |   1 p <mm at 0 <p <mm, ∥ f ∥و = ∥ f ∥l least (s): = sup eed ∣∣ f (ă) ∣∣ <mm with p = urb. According to the definition of [1-3], the function f, the analytical in the circle d = {z ∈ C: | z | <1}, belongs to the space of Hardy HP, 0 <p ≤ main, if the quasinorm is finite ∥ f ∥hp = sup rative (0.1) ∥ f ∥LP (SR), where SR is the circumference | ctor | = r. As you know, for almost all ă ∈ D, the function f (z), z ∈ D has non -cupual limiting values. Thus, the function F ∈ HP is determined not only in D, but also almost everywhere on ∂D - the border D. It turns out that ∥ f ∥hp = ∥ f ∥lp (∂d). 258 Materials of the International School-Conference Let PN-many algebraic polynomials of the degree no higher than n. For the function F ∈ HP, we enter EN (f) p = inf pn et wood ∥ f −Pn∥hp, n = 0, 1, 2, ... - the best approximation f by means of the set PN. In the theory of polynomial approximations, the following implication, the so -called jackson type theorem is well known, is well known for: hp = ⇒ en (f) p é c ns ∥∥∥ f (s) ∥∥∥ hp at n ê s, (1 ) where C> 0 and depends only on P and S, and f (s)-the derivative (s ∈N) functions f. In the case of 1 ≤ P ≤ear, the ratio (1) is proved similarly to the jackson theorem for periodic functions [5]. Further, E.A. Storozhenko [4] gives an analogue of Jackson's first theorem for HP spaces at 0 <p <1 for first -order continuity modules and conducts a generalization in case of modules of smoothness of arbitrary order [6]. For α ∈ R \ z, we introduce the function Fα (Z) = (1- Z) α, where the main branch is taken in the region \ [1, urb]. From the implication (1) we immediately obtain that with N → و the weak equivalence EN (Fα) p ≈ n - 1 p, α ∈ ( - 1 p, urb) \ z. (2) In case of a flat measure of the Lebag, rather deep studies were not conducted in this direction. However, it can be noted that in 1961 S.Ya. Alper [7] studied issues related to the approximation of analytical functions on average, in particular, he received an analogue of inequality (1) under conditions S = 0, P ≥ 1. Generalization (1) for other parameter values ​​in case of a flat measure were obtained author [8]. Let M2 be a flat measure of the Lebeg. Through AP = AP (D), 0 <p é least, we denote the space of the Begman1 analytical functions f in D, endowed with the final quasinorm ∥ f ∥ap = ∥ f ∥LP (d) (the norm at 1 é p éicle) relative to a flat measure Lebbeg. Namely, ∥ f ∥AP = ∥ f ∥LP (D): = (ˆ d ∣∣ f (hole) ∣∣p dm2 (hole)) 1 p <p <mm, ∥ f ∥aurb = ∥ f ∥l least (D): = SUP ther ∣∣ f (Answers) ∣∣ <mm with p = inous. It is clear that the spaces of Horry and Aives coincide. Therefore, then we consider the case 0 <p <mm. For f ∈ AP (D), we enter EN (F) AP = Inf pnphn ∥ f −pn∥ap (d), n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 1 sometimes this space is called the space of MM Drzhbashyan. V.R. Misyuk 259 is the best approximation of function F in space AP by means of a set PN. The next result [8] can be considered as an appropriate jackson type theorem for AP: S ion and F (S) ∈ AP (D), 0 <p <mm, then EN (F) AP é c ns ∥∥∥ f (S) ∥∥∥ AP, N = S, S +1 ,. . . , (3) where C> 0 and does not depend on f and n. Based on the ratio (3), we have shown that weak equivalence (2) for N → φ will accept the type EN (Fα) p ≈ N --α - 2 p, α ∈ ( - 2 p, urb) \ z.
