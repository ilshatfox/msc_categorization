Functions of the type of sinus for subharmonic function, the term “sinus type functions” first appeared in the work [1], which refers to the function of the sinus type for the support function h (z) = max worn re (zW) of the convex polygon D. 17 V. [2] The concept of the function of the sinus type is generalized for the supporting functions of convex areas with smooth boundaries. In our work, functions of the sinus type are constructed for subharmonic functions of the species U (Rez), where U is some function convex at the interval of an material axis. The work was carried out with financial support of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Belarus (state contract 13/3 - FM for the performance of work on the GNTP.
