Materials of the School-Conference of UDC 517.518.87 On syncproximation of special integrals according to the actual axis of Yu.S. Soliev1 1 SU1951@mail.ru; The Moscow Road State Technical University for special (singular and hypercingular) integrals with a cosa nucleus on a real axis using syncproximations built and studied quadrature formulas with nodes of various multiplicity. Keywords: special integral, syncproximation, quadrature formula. Sink-apoproximation of analytical functions and their applications are well studied [1]- [3]. Important results in this direction in the class of continuous functions at the segment were obtained in the works of A.Yu. Trynina (see, e.g., [4]). The application of syncapproximation to the approximate calculation of the singular integral of Hilbert was considered in the work [5]. Below are the issues of the application of syncproximations to the calculation of the integrals k f = k (f; x) = 1 π ∫ +و – et (t) t −x d t, (1) a f = a (f; x) = 1 π ∫ +و –ura f (t) 2 d T (2) understood in the sense of the main value of the cat and the final value according to Adamar, respectively, where F (x) is the density of integrals. Let C - many of all complex numbers, R - many of all real numbers, lp (r) - the space of all functions of functions f with the norm with the norm∥∥ f ∥∥lp <mm, where ∥∥ f ∥∥lp = {(∫ r ∣∣ f (t) ∣∣p d t) 1/p, 1 ≤ p <mm; SUP xorn ∣∣ f (t) ∣∣, p = ger}. Following [1], we denote: w (h) (h> 0) - a class of functions f, analytical in C, such as f (t) ∈ L2 (r) and ∀z ∈ C The inequality ∣∣ f (z) is performed ∣∣ ≤ c1 exp (π | z | h), where ck (k = 1.2, ...) - positive constant; Lα (DD) - class of analytical functions f in the field DD = {z ∈C: | IMZ | <d}, such that ∀z ∈ DD is performed inequality∣∣ f (z) ∣∣≤c2 ∣∣Exp (αz) ∣∣ (1+ ∣∣Exp z∣∣) −2α, α> 0. For F ∈W (h) is fair [1] representation f (x) = φ∑ k = −mm f (kh) sinc x −kh h, sinc x = sinπx πx. (3) denote fn (x) = n∑ k = −n f (kh) sinc x −kh h. Yu.S. Soliev 313 Approaching the density of the integrals by the expression fn (x), we get the quadrature formulas k f = k (fn; x) +rn f = π 2h n∑ k = −n f (kh) (kh З) sinc2 x −kh 2h + Rn f, (4) a f = a (fn; x)+rn f = π 2h n∑ k = −n f (kh) (sinc2 x −kh 2h −2sinc x −kh h)+rn f, (5 ) where rn f = rn (f; x) - residual members. Theorem 1. Let F ∈ Lα (DD), α> 0, h = √ πd αn and p = 2 or p = inous. Then, for the remainingive member of the quadrature formula (4), the rating ∥∥RN F ∥∥LP ≤c3n (1– 1P) /2 (LN N) 1–2P Exp ( - p πdαn) is fair. The quadrature formula (4) is given in [6] and studied for densities from other classes of functions. Theorem 2. In the conditions of theorem 1, for the residual member of the quadrature formula (5), the rating ∥∥RN F ∥∥LP ≤c4n (3 - 1p) /2 (ln n) 1–2p Exp ( - p πdαn) is fair. Let us now consider the case of multiple nodes. For f ∈ W (h) it is true [3] representation f (x) = φ∑ k = −mm (f (kh)+ (x −kh) f ′ (kh) sinc2 x −kh h. (6) Therefore, if f ∈W (h), then k f = k (f; x) = φ∑ k = − least (ak (x) f (kh)+bk (x) f ′ (kh)) , A f = a (f; x) = φ∑ k = −mm (ck (x) f (kh)+dk (x) f ′ (kh)), ak = h π (x −kh) (sinc 2 (x −kh) h −1), bk (x) = h π sinc 2 (x −kh) h, ck = 2h π (x −kh) 2 (1 - sinc 2 (x −kh) h) - 2π h sinc2 x −kh h, dk (x) = h π (x −kh) (1– SINC 2 (x −KH) h) - 2π h (x −kh) sinc2 x −kh h, (7) we denote 314 Materials of the School-Conference HN (x) = n∑ k = −n (f (kh)+ (x −kh) f ′ (KH)) sinc2 x −kh h. Then k f = k (hn; x)+rn f = n∑ k = −n (ak (x) f (kh)+bk (x) f ′ (kh))+rn f, (8) a f = A (hn; x)+rn f = n∑ k = −n (ak (x) f (kh)+bk (x) f ′ (kh))+rn f, (9) where ak (x), bk (x), ck (x) and dk (x) defined in (7). Theorem 3. In the conditions of theorem 1 for residual members of the quadrature formulas (8) and (9), the valuation ∥∥RN F ∥∥LP ≤c5n (3– 1P)/2 (ln n) 1–2p Exp (—pπdαn) is true respectively. ∥∥RN F ∥∥LP ≤c6n (5–1p)/2 (ln n) 1 - 2p Exp (−pπdαn). Note that some quadrature formulas for hypercingular integrals of Kosh and Hilbert, understood in the sense of the final part according to Adamar, are considered in the works [7], [8]. Literature 1.
