The bicopperiodic task “On the jump” for the elliptical equation of the second order I.A. Bikchantaev1 1 ibikchan@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky, for a homogeneous differential equation of the second order of the elliptical type with constant coefficients, is investigating the regional task of finding two -peridic solutions for a given jump in their derivatives on the smooth and at an indispensable closed circuit. The necessary and sufficient conditions for resolving the problem have been established, obvious formulas were obtained to solve it. Keywords: Elliptical equation, the regional task, two -income function. Let l = ∑2 k = 0 ak ∂2 ∂x2–k∂yk - an elliptical operator with constant complex coefficients A0, A1, A2. Elliptyness means that A2 ̸ = 0 and characteristic polynomial A0 +A1S +A2S2 do not have material roots. We denote the roots of this polynomial through S1 and S2. We will assume that they are different and IM SQ> 0, Q = 1, 2. Consider the equation l f = 0. (1) the actual and imaginary parts of the solution F of this equation satisfy the main equation with a flat anisotropic theory of elasticity (see [1], p. 32). Here, a bicoperiodic task of conjugation is being studied to solve this equation. Double -proped solutions to the equation (1). Let ω1 and ω2 - complex numbers, such that IM (ω2/ω1) ̸ = 0. They give rise to a bicoperiodic group P2 P2 transformations ω (z) = z+m1ω1+m2ω2, m2 = 0, ± 1, ± 2, ± 2, ± 2, ± 2, ± 2, ± 2, . . . , with the main periods ω1 and ω2. To obtain one of the fundamental regions of the R0 group P2, we take the arbitrary point ă ∈ C and build a parallelogram with the peaks cil, cil+ω1, cil+ω1+ω2, lection+ω2. The opposite aspects of this parallelogram are connected by transformations Z → Z +ω1 and Z → Z +ω2, which generate the entire group P2. For certainty, we assume that the beginning of the coordinates is in R0. We will study the solutions of equation (1), invariant regarding the P2 group. Let the pipe - open set in the complex plane C, invariant from the wearable group P2. The general solution of the equation (1) on the set ω can be written in the form of [2] f (z) = ng (z1)+ onic (z2), (2) where zq = tq (z): = x+ sq y, q = 1, 2, - the afford transformation of the plane of the complex alternating variable Z = x + IY, which retains orientation, lus - analytical functions in TQ (ω). We put ωk j: = t j ​​(ωk), k, j = 1, 2. For the unity of presentation 64, the materials of the school-conference (2) can be assumed that Сory (a2) = 0, where a2: = t2 (a), a ∈ Pi. If f (z) is continuous in ω, then point A can also be taken on the border of ∂ω sets ω. Following L.I. Chibrikova ([3], p. 213), the function G (Z) will be called quasiperiodic if, when the argument z on ω changes, it acquires some constant term η, that is, g (z +ω) - g (z) = η. Lemma. If F (Z) is the solution of equation (1) regularly in ω (1), invariant relative to the group P2, then the functions ng (z1) and ∗2 (z2) quasiperiodic with cyclic constant − pul (a2 +ωk2) and ∗2 (a2 +ωk2), respectively, respectively . Double -proped task ”about the jump“ For analytical functions. Let the smooth closed contour line lying inside the parallelogram Riodes R0, γ is the unification of γ0 and all congruent to it relative to the P2 contours group, D+ is the combination of the accounting number of limited single -legged regions, the boundaries of which are the components of the contour γ, d - c \ d+. Consider the following task (see [3], p. 209 - 232, [4], p. 143 –163). Find a quasi -pieridic limited piece of line analytical function φ (z) with specified cyclic constant α1 and α2, continuously continuously on γ from the regions d+ and d - and that has a given leap φ+ (t) −φ - (t) = g (t) , t ∈ γ, (4) where g (t) ∈ Hµ (γ), 0 <µ≤ 1, is a function, invariant regarding the transformations of group P2. A necessary and sufficient condition for solvability of the problem (4) is the fulfillment of the condition ∫ γ0 g (τ) dτ = α22 −α112. (5) In this case, the solution to the problem is determined by the formula φ (z) = 1 2πi ∫ γ0 g (τ) ζ (τ - z) dτ + c + z 2πi (η1α22 —η2α1). Here C is an arbitrary permanent, ζ (z)-a veierstrass's dzeta-function with cyclic permanent η1 = ζ (z +ω1) — ζ (z) and η2 = ζ (z +ω2) — ζ (z). From here, with α1 = 0 and α2 = 0, the following result follows. Condition ∫ γ0 g (τ) dτ = 0 (6) is necessary and sufficient so that the task (4) has a limited bicoperiodic solution determined by the formula φ (z) = 1 2πi γ γ0 g (τ) ζ (τ - z ) Dτ+C. (7) I.A. Bikcantaev 65 Double -incidental task of conjugation for the equation (1). Let γ0 be a smooth closed contour lying inside the parallelogram of the ryodes R0 and oriented counterclockwise. We assume that the beginning of the coordinates lies with γ0. We denote through S+0 the final region limited by the contour γ0, S -0 = R0 \ S+0, S+is the combination of S+0 and all the congruent areas relative to the group of parallel transformations generated by the transformations Z → Z+ωk, K = 1, 2, γ is the unification of γ0 and all contours congruent and s - there is an addition to the set S+ to C. The task we are considering is formulated by the following
