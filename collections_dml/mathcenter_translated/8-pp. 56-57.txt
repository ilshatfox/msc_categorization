Space with a unitaryly generated one and a half -line form in this message describes the half -following, and in terms of half -traces - probability on the hyperbolic logic of projectors. Let M - the algebra of the Neumann in the Hilbert space h and let U: = ∫ eiison, the unitary operator. Algebra M is called W ∗ U -algebra, if m ⊆ r ′ (U2). W ∗ u -algebra m is called W ∗ P -albro, if at least one of the projectors p+: = eπ --0 or p -: = i -eπ -0 is final relative to the Let PU: = {p ∈ M: p2 = p, (upx, y) = (ux, py), ∀x, y ∈ H}. Projector P ∈ PU is called the maximum positive (maximum negative) if the pH is the maximum positive (maximum negative) subspace relative to indepinite metric ((2p+−i) x, y), x, y ∈ H. Let p+u (p --u) - a lot of all positive (negative) projectors in PU, and P+M (P - M) are many maximum positive (maximum negative) projectors in PU. For any p ∈ P ± u, we denote through E ± p the orthopriotector on p ± pH. Each projector E ∈ PU seems (not the only way!) In the form E = E + + E -, E ± ∈ P ± U. The material measure µ: pu → R is called half a trace if there are an exact normal semi -inferior trace and the operator m attached to the center of the algebra is such that: or p+t ∈ L1 (m, τ) and then µ (e) = τ (τ (e) TE+) ∀E ∈ PU or p --t ∈ L1 (m, τ) and then µ (e) = τ (te -) ∀e ∈ Pu. For a factor case, the weakened version of the theorem 1 formulated below was previously proved by M. S. Matveychuk. Theorem 1. Let µ: pu → r measure on w ∗ u -algebra. Ple 56 blowing conditions are equivalent: i) µ is the sum of the half -traces; II) µ is constant on many maximum positive (maximum negative) projectors; III) µ (e+p) = µ (p) ∀p ∈ P+U and µ (E --P) = µ (p) ∀p ∈ P --u. Theorem 2. Let µ: pu → r+ -probabilistic measure on w ∗ u -algebra m (type M is different from I2). Then there is a non -equal component, which is W ∗ P is algebra, the narrowing µ on it is again a probability and µ is the sum of the half -traces.

Vladova (Ulyanovsk) Some limiting theorems for measures on hyperbolic logic in this message on W — the algebra are summarized by two limit theorems proven by M. S. Matveychuk [1], [2] for the case of W ∗ J -factors. We adhere to the designations and terminology of work [3]. Theorem 1. Let the PU -the set of all U -sample projectors from semi -pointed w ∗ u -algebrym without a direct component type in, n ≤ 4 and let µn: pu → R -sequence of indepinite measures. Suppose that for any projector p ∈ Pu there is the final limit µ (p): = lim n → φ µn (p). Then τ (pα) → α 0 entails ‖pα‖ - 1µn (pα) → α 0 evenly by n. If, in addition, M is the final algebra, then µ: PU → R is an indepinite measure. 57
