) Analysis of the results of the application of the method of moments to the tasks of underground hydrodynamics in the work, approximate analytical dependence for the pressure field in oil deposits by the projection method House of moments [1]. Graphs of approximations and accurate solutions using the EXCEL 7.0 program are built. The analysis of the results allows us to conclude that when solving specific tasks of developing oil fields with sufficient accuracy for practice, it is possible to limit the approximations of the second and third orders. The resulting analytical dependencies were used in solving the reverse problems of underground hydrodynamics. In particular, when determining the permeability coefficients, hydraulic end and piezeceneability of the formation according to the specified commercial values ​​of wells of wells. Literature 1.
