The orders of the boundary zeros of the solutions of the degree of Riemann, the degree of Riemann [φ+(t)] α = g (t) [φ - (t)] β, t ∈ L, (1) of which are boundary zeros τj ∈ L, j = 1, r, was considered in the works [1] - [8]. In this case, the study was conducted in two directions depending on the setting of the task. At the first production ([1] - [6]), an analytical continuation [φ+ (t)] α and [φ - (t)] β in the semi -oral zero in d+ and d - respectively, and with functional indicators α and β In addition, the fulfillment of the regional condition on the multi -leaf circuit ([3], [5]), or on one -leafy [6]. During the second setting [7], such a continuation was not required. Here the functions φ ± (z) were considered solutions if there were branches [φ+(t)] α and [φ - (t)] β on the arcs l \ {τj} R1, for which the condition (1) was fulfilled. This difference led to the fact that in the first case the functions [φ+(t)] α, [φ - (t)] β at each point τj had a whole order, and during the second setting, a fractional order was allowed (an attempt to study the problem in a fractional order It was made in [8], but the final result is true only for a whole order). In this work, the task (1) with indicators α, β ∈ R+ is considered in the second formulation. The equivalence of the nonlinear task and counting set of linear homogeneous tasks of Riemann with a breakdown coefficient is shown. The structure of the order of zeros on the circuit on the circuit was obtained. The limited number of boundary zeros was proved when α and β are rational and unlimited, 61 when α or β is irrational. The arbitrariness of the constant solutions has been investigated. 1. Let L - a smooth closed contour that divides the plane into areas D+(0 ∈ D+) and D - (∞ ∈ D -), oriented counterclockwise. It is required to find all the functions φ (z) 6 = 0 with z ∈ C \ L, analytical in c \ l, continuously continuously on L on the left and right (i.e., φ (z) ∈ Hipp (D ±) ∩ C ( D ±)), having R> 0 different zeros on L (i.e., φ (z) ∈ H 0.0, R), according to the boundary condition [φ+(t)] α = tκ [φ - (t) ] β, t ∈ L, (2) where α, β ∈ R+, κ ∈ Z. Let ω = {τJ} R1, through τJ ∈ L, J = 1, R, R> 1, the points are indicated, the solutions are indicated, The condition L. Condition (2), located in the order of positive bypass, understand so that there are branches of LN φ ± (t) on the open arcs l \ ω, in which the equality of EXP [α ln φ+(t)] = tκ exp [β ln φ - (t)], (3) A at points τj [φ+(τj)] α = lim exp [α ln φ+(t)] = 0, [φ - (τj)] β = lim Exp [ β ln φ - (t)] = 0 for t → τj, t ∈ L. The setting of the task shows that in the general case the function ln φ ± (t), which means [φ+(t)] α, [φ - (t)] β, do not continue analytically in the semi -orality of τj points, respectively, in D+ and D -. However, since φ ± (z) 6 = 0 with z ∈ D ±, there are branches of logarithms, we call them l̃nφ ± (z), which are analytical in d ±. From LN φ ± (t) on arcs they differ in numbers, multiple 2πi, and without limiting the community, we can assume that they coincide on the arc τ1τ2. From (3) we have EXP {α [l̃nφ + (t) + 2πin + (t)]} = tκ exp {β [l̃nφ - (t) + 2πin - (t)]}, (4) where n ± (t) -Linge and maintenance functions with ruptures at points τj, j = 1, r, taking integers. Enter the function f (z) from hinger ∩ c (d ±): f+(z) = exp [α l̃n φ+(z)], f - (z) = exp [β l̃n φ - (z )], (5) f ± (τj) = lim f ± (z) = 0, z → τj, z ∈ D ±; F ± (z) 6 = 0, z ∈ D ± (i.e., f (z) ∈ H 0.0, R). For her, we have from (4) f+(t) = tκ exp [2πin (t)] f - (t), t ∈ L. (6) here n (t) = {0, t ∈ τ1τ2; - k∑ j = 2 (αkj+βlj), t ∈ τkτk+1, k = 2, r}, (7) 62 τr+1 = τ1, kj, lj ∈ Z any; N (t) = 0 for r = 1. Thus, if φ ± (z) are solutions to (2), then F ± (Z), diluted in (5), satisfy the condition (6). Back, if f ± (z) - solutions to the problem (6), then the functions φ+(z) = [f+(z)] 1/α, φ - (z) = [f - (z)] 1/β, (8) where the branches are taken, the analytical respectively in D ±, will satisfy the regional condition (2) (7). Indeed, let F (Z) - solving the problem (6). Take φ ± (z) from (8). Then f+(z) = [φ+(z)] α = exp [αl̃nφ+(z)], f - (z) = exp [β l̃nφ - (z)] = ⇒ exp [αl̃nφ+(t)] = tκ exp [2πin (t) + β l̃nφ - (t)]. It follows that the branches of ln φ ± (t), which satisfy (3), will be ln φ+(t) = l̃nφ+(t)+2πi k∑ j = 2 kj, ln φ - (t) = l̃nφ - (t ) - 2πi k∑ j = 2 lj, t ∈ τkτk+1, k = 2, r. The theorem 1. Problem (2) and tasks (6) are equivalent to ∀kj, ∀lj ∈ Z, their solutions are connected by formulas (5), (8). We study the tasks (6). With r = 1, we get a solution that are different from zero only at κ> 0: f+(z) = c (z - τ1) κ, f - = c (z - τ1 z) κ. (9) Under R> 2, we solve the problem (6) with the explosive coefficient Tκ Exp [2πin (t)], following [9], p. 254. Let γ (z) = 1 2πi ∫ l κ ln τ dτ τ τ τ τ τ τ τ τ τ τ τ τ τ ∑ j = 2 ∫ τ τk + 1 ∑k j = 2 {αkj + βlj} dτ τ - z, where the branch of the logarithm ln τ is fixed to L \ {τ1}, ln Exp [2πin (t)] = {0, t ∈ τ1τ2; −2πi k∑ j = 2 {αkj + βlj}, t ∈ τkτk + 1}, 63 {x} - fractional part X. For the canonical function, take χ (z) = (z - τ1) —κ1 exp γ (z), κ1 = [κ - r∑ j = 2 {αkj + βlj}], where [x] is the whole part X. Then, different from zero solution, we get the problem κ1> 0: f+(z) = pκ1 (z - τ1) κ - κ1 r = 2 [(z - τj)/(z - τ1)] {αkjj. +βlj}, (10) f - (z) = z --kin (z) (z - τ1) κ - κ r∏ j = 2 [(z - τj)/(z - τ1)] {αkj+βlj} , (11) where is pκ1 (z) - MN
