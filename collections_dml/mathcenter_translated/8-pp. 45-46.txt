For the equation of a hyperbolic type with two degeneration lines and equal positive parameters on the set G = G - ∪g+, G - = {(X, Y) | - h <—Y <x <0}, g+ = {(x, y) | 0 <x <y <h}, for the equation l (u) ≡ (y2 - x2) uxy + 2pyux - 2pxuy = 0, (1) 0 <2p <1, the existence and unity of the problem of the problem E: Find the function u ( x, y) such that l (u) ≡ 0 on the set G, u (x, y) ∈ C (g) and u (x, x) = τ - (x), x ∈ [--h, 0 ], (2) u (x, x) = τ+ (x), x ∈ [0, h]. (3) The function u (x, y) satisfies the conjugation condition: lim x → −0 1 x ∂x x∫ −y (t2 - x2) –λ1 (t2) r1 u - (t, y) d (t2) = = b lim x →+ 0 1 x ∂x y∫ x (t2 - x2) −λ2 (t2) r2 u+ (t, y) d (t2), (4) 45 b> 0, 0 <λi <1, Ri> λi I = 1, 2. (5) The existence and unity of the solution of the problem is proved according to the following scheme: 1) in the region of G-the problem DD1 is solved by the Riemann-Adamar with data (2) and D1 (U (0, Y)) = UY (0, Y) + + a (0, y) u (0, y), y ∈ [0, h], (6) 2) in the G+ region - with data (3) and (6). The following statement has been proven. Theorem. If conditions (4), (5), ri --λi = 1, i = 1, 2 and τ - (x) ∈ C1 [—h, 0], τ+ (x) ∈ C1 [0, h], are met. τ - (0) = τ+ (0) = 0, then the solution of the problem E exists and only. L and T R A T R A 1.
