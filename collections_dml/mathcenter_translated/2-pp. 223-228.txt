) Integral equations of the boundary tasks of the flat theory of elasticity for anisotropic bodies with a defect along the segment in this work considered the main boundary tasks for elastic anisotropic plane, half -plate and a circle along the segment of the material axis. Complex potentials were built and singular integral equations with a logarithmic feature in the nucleus and with the core nucleus, equivalent to the first and second boundary tasks of the flat theory of elasticity, were built. Numerical solutions of integral equations were found by Galerkin. The main boundary tasks of the flat theory of elasticity for anisotropic bodies with a defect can be reduced to the definition of two functions that are analytical in some areas [1]. Let the orthotropic body fill the plane with a defect along the segment of the material axis [a, b]. Consider the auxiliary task of the jump. Let the jumps of integrated stresses and displacements are set on [a, b] [φ (t)+αφ (t)+βψ (t)]+ - [φ (t)+αφ (t)+β (t)] - = t ∫ a c (τ) dτ, t ∈ [a, b], (1) 223 [γφ (t)+δφ (t)+ψ (t)]+ - [γφ (t)+δφ (t)+ψ ( t)] - = t∫ a d (τ) dτ, t ∈ [a, b], (2) more than b∫ a c (τ) dτ = b∫ a d (τ) dτ = 0, (3) where φ (· ), Ψ (·)-the desired analytical functions that determine the stress-deformed state of the body, α, β, γ, Δ-specified material constant [1]. We assume that the functions C (·), D (·) satisfy the condition of the Helder on any part of the segment [a, b], which does not contain the ends, and at points A and B may have the features of the integrated order. Lemma 1. If the analytical in the piece of the material axis cut according to the segment [a, b] the complex plane of the function φp (·), ψp (·) are limited to infinity and satisfy the conditions (1) - (3), then φp (z) = 1 2π b∫ a onic (τ) b∫ τ dă μ - z dτ +q, (4) ψp (z) = 1 2π b∫ a ψ (τ) b∫ τ dă μ - z dτ +r, (5) where ∗ (τ) = re c (τ) - β re d (τ) 1– β (γ + δ) + α + i IM (τ) - β IM D (τ) 1 + β (δ - γ) - - α, ψ (τ) = 1 βower - α (δc (τ) - αd (τ) - (δ - αγ) onic (τ)), q, r are arbitrary complex constant. Consider the first and second boundary tasks. Let the self -self -voltages [φ (t) + αφ (t) + βψ (t) ± = f (t), t ∈ [a, b], 224 or displacements [γφ (t) + + are set by [a, b]. δφ (t) + ψ (t)] ± = g (t), t ∈ [a, b]. In the first case, C (·) ≡ 0, D (·) is the desired function, in the second - D (·) ≡ 0, C (·) - the desired function (it is easy to check that the task can always be brought to this type [2 ]). Theorem 1. The first and second basic boundary tasks for the elastic anisotropic plane with a defect along the segment of the material axis [a, b] are equivalent to integral equations b∫ a (µ Im d (τ) + iν re d (τ) b∫ τ dτ τ - t = f (t), t ∈ [a, b], and b∫ a (κ IM c (τ) + iλ re c (τ)) b∫ τ dτ τ - t = g (t), t ∈ [a, b], where µ, ν, κ, λ are known material permanent. Note that the logarithmic features in the nuclei of integral equations are contained in integrals such as Koshi with variable limits. As follows from the general theory of integral equations with the logarithmic feature in the nucleus [3], it is easy to move to the equivalent syllabular integral equations with the cosa core relative to the primary functions C (·) and D (·). Such a transformation of the equation is reduced to integrating in parts in the integral with the logarithmic nucleus, and not to differentiation of both parts of the equation. Let d+ - an elastic anisotropic circle | z | <R with a defect along the segment of the material axis [a, b], l - the border, d - - - the appearance of the circle. Suppose that there is no voltage on the border of the circle, i.e. The condition φ+(t)+αφ+(t)+βψ+(t) = 0, t ∈ L. (6) lemma 2. If analytical in the segment of the material axis [a, b] circle | z | <R Functions φ (·), ψ (·) continuously continuously continuous for all points L and satisfy the conditions 225 (1) - (3) and (6), then φ (·) = φP (·) + φ0 (Z), Ψ (·) = ψP (·) + ψ0 (z), where φ0 (z) = - 1 α (φp (r2/z) + βψp (r2/z) + s), ψ0 (z) = 1 β F0 (z) - φ0 (z) + s), f0 (z) = - 1 2πi ∫ l h (x) dx x - z, h (t) = φ + p (t) + αφ + p (t) + βψ + p (t), s - arbitrary complex constant. In the case of the first boundary task with given self -self -stresses, the theorem 2. The first main boundary task for the elastic anisotropic circle | Z | <R with a defect along the segment of the material axis [a, b] is equivalent to the integrated equation b∫ a d (τ) b∫ τ (1 τ - t - t tτ —r2) dτ = µ re f (t) + i immediately Im F (t ( ), t ∈ [a, b], where µ, ν is the specified material constant. Let D - - the elastic anisotropic half -plate re Z> 0 with the defect along the segment of the material axis [a, b], the area D+ supplements D - to the full plane, l is the border between D - and D+. Lemma 3. If analytical in the material axis cut along the segment [a, b] half -plate re z> 0 function φ (·), ψ (·) continuously continuously continuously continuously on all points of the imaginary axis, satisfy the conditions (1) - (3) and φ - (t) + αφ - (t) + βψ - (t) = 0, t ∈ L, then φ (·) = φp (·) + φ0 (z), ψ (·) = ψp (·) + ψ0 (z), 226 where φ0 (z) = - 1 α (φp (--z) + βψp ( - З) + t), ψ0 (z) = 1 β (f0 (z) - φ0 (z) + t) , T is an arbitrary complex constant. In the case of the first boundary task, the theorem is valid
