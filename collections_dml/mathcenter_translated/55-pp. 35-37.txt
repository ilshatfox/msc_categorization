Nekriptographic hash-function and the sum of the numbers of a random natural number A. Bolshakov1, D. Stepanyan2, A.V. Rozhkov3 1 anastaicha94@mail.ru; Kuban State University 2 Diana14.02.94@mail.ru; Kuban State University 3 ros.seminar@bk.ru; Kuban State University studies the tasks of the theory of numbers that can be model for other sections of mathematics. Key words: numbers theory, computed algebra, cryptography, simple numbers. Building hash-functions Definition. The function χ, which makes the message of the fixed length in accordance with the arbitrary length message, is called a hash function. It is equivalent, the display χ: n → n, having the final image is called a hash function. The hash is called non -critographic if encryption is not used in the process of its creation. Note that the whole world uses a non -critographic hash. Russian GOST R 34.11–2012 hash-functions since 2012 also became non-critographic. Definition. The function ψ: n → n is called unidirectional if for any n ∈ N the image ψ (n) = M is calculated for polynomial time, but there is no polynomial algorithm that calculates the prototype n image m. The problem of constructing hash functions is one of the main in cryptography. There is no mathematically strict evidence that at least one of the hash functions is crypto-resistant. That is why the whole world uses the same algorithms - to die so together! Two of the most important properties of hash function. Hash should be very difficult to find a prototype, i.e. The hash must be none -directional functions. It should be very difficult to simultaneously create two different messages with the same Hash. The extreme importance of the hash in cryptography is determined by the fact that in all state systems of the electronic signature, not the message itself is encrypted, but its hash. Therefore, cryptographs, mathematicians and just lovers of high technology and difficult tasks create their hash functions in the hope of creating a mathematically impeccable tool. In our work, a hash is proposed based on simple arithmetic concepts. Let N - a natural number taken in the decimal record and S (N) - the sum of the numbers of this number. If the function S is sequentially apply to the amounts received, then the GE will get some figure belonging to the set J = {1.2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. 36 Materials of the Youth School-Conference Function, which puts the initial natural number of this final figure, denote s: n → J. Lemma 1. Let n = j +9k, j ∈ J, k ∈N natural number, then, s (n) = j. Lemma 2. The following sets coincide: J3 = {S (N3), N ∈N} = {1,8,9}. Determination of non-critographic hash function. Let some message be encoded by a natural number, then we will take the number S (m 3) as its hash. In order to choose a message m with a given hesh, for example, 2017, we need to find such a natural number M that s (m 3) = 2017. Given how the function of the sum of the number of numbers is whimsical, the solution of such a problem is very difficult. Theorem 1. An unusual condition for the existence of a natural number, such that S (m 3) = n is the inclusion of S (n) ∈ J3. On the other hand, if n ∈ {1+9k, 8+9k, 18k, 9 (6k - 1) | k ∈N}, then the desired decision m exists. For the numbers of the species n ∈ {9 (6k −5), 9 (6k −3) | k ∈N} is unknown. About the sum of the numbers of a random natural number, random numbers play a huge role in cryptography - they are the main tool when choosing a encryption key. It is wrong that the mathematical expectation of the number of chosen at random is 9/2, and the sum of the numbers of a random nobility is 9n/2. Lemma 3. The weighted average N-digit of a natural number is 9/2+ 1/2n The sum of the digits of a random N-digit of a natural number is 9n/2+ 1/2. Theorem 2. The weighted average number of the number that has no more than n signs is 9 2 + 9 20 · 10 n 10n −1 · (1 1 · 10n -1 + 1 2 · 10n-2 + ... + 1 n · 109) . Put SN = 9 20 · (1 1 · 10n - 1 + 1 2 · 10n --2 + ... + 1 n · 109). Theorem 3. For any N> 1 there are inequalities 1 2N + 1 (2N) 2> SN> 1 2N + 1 (2N) 3. For N> 11, the inequalities 1 2n + 1 16N2> SN> 1 2N + 1 18N2 are true. A. Bolshakova, D. Stepanyan, A.V. Rozhkov 37 Condition 1. Lim N → ° SN 1 2N + 118N2 = 1. Investigation 2. For N> 11 the amount of a random number of no more than a N-digit number belongs to the interval (9n +1 2 + 1 18n, 9n +1 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 16n). Literature 1. Rozhkov A.V.
