Substantiating the methods of improving the solutions to the problems of dispersion of waves by the periodical structures of K. G. Zverev Kazan State University, zverev@pai.ru The tasks of diffraction of electromagnetic waves on periodic structures belong to the classical tasks of the Namika electrodes and are based on Maxwell’s equations (see, for example, [see, for example, [see one]). A number of tasks, in particular, the tasks of scattering the flat field of a risisic electromagnetic wave by periodic structures are formulated in the form of regional tasks for the Helmholtz equations ∆U + k2u = 0, where K is a wave number, ∆ - opera Rator Laplace (see, for example, [2 ]). When the wave scattering with metal structures, in the variability of polarization, the task of the airship U (X, Y) | S = f (x, y) 106 for the tearization and the task of the Neumann ∂u (x, y) ∂n | S = are considered G (X, Y) for TM-Polyarization, where S is a periodic border. The task of spreading waves in the dielectric structure of the rah leads to the problem ∆U1 (x, y) + k 2 1U1 (x, y) = 0, ∆U2 (x, y) + k 2 2u2 (x, y) = 0 with conjugation conditions on the border U1 (x, y) - u2 (x, y) = f (x, y), p1 ∂ ∂ ~ n u1 (x, y) - p2 ∂ ∂ ~ n u2 (x, y) = g (x , y). In addition, the fulfillment of partial radiation conditions is supposed to ensure the absence of waves coming from infinity (see, for example, [3]). In the space of quasiperiodic functions, the theorems are true for the disclosure of the regional tasks. In the works [4], [5], the tasks of diffraction on periodic structures are reduced to the integral equations of Fredgolm of the second kind (i −k) φ = h (1) in the case of the tasks of the airship and the Neumann, and to the system of integral equations (e - t) Y = H (2) in the case of a mating task, where t is the matrix of integrated operators, y = [σ ρ], h = [f g]. 107 In the work, a justification was carried out (in the sense of work [6]) with a close algorithm of solutions of equations (1), (2). Calculation of the body scheme is based on the approximation of unknown functions by periodic vesevites (for example, [7]) φ (x) = α0aper (x) + n∑ j = 0 2j --1∑ q = 0 bjq̃jq (x), σn (x) = α0aper ° Pine (x) + n∑ j = 0 2j - 1∑ q = 0 bjq̃jq (x), ρn (x) = α̃0aper (x) + n∑ j = 0 2j --1∑ q = 0 b̃jq̃jq (x). For justification, the version of the general theory is used in close methods, developed by B. G. Gabdulkhaev (see, for example, [6]), for this, the condition for the permissibility of the integration of grave equations was found and the necessary assessments were made. L and T R A T R A 1.
