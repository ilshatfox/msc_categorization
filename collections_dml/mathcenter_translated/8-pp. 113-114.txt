) One task for the equation equation of string oscillations Consider the equation Uxy = 0 on the set h = h+ ∪h - where h+ = {(x, y) | 0 <x <y <h}, 113 h - = {(x, y) | 0 <y <x <h}. Task. On the set H, the solution of the equation of the vibration of the string, continuous in h̄, satisfying the conditions y∫ 0 u (x, y) dx = φ1 (y), y ∈ [0, h], u (x, 0) = φ2 (x) , x ∈ [0, h], (ux - uy) | y = x+0 = (ux - uy) | y = x --0, where φ1 (y), φ2 (x) are given functions. The solution of the task, belonging to a special class of solutions V0, was found in an explicit form and the following theorem has been proven. If φi (x) ∈ C1 [0, h], i = 1, 2, φ ′ 2 (0) = 0 and the condition φ ′ 1 (x) x + φ ′ 2 (x) = φ0 (x) is fulfilled and fulfilled x R, where r> 0, φ0 (x) ∈ C [0, h], then there is the only solution to the task in class V0, continuous in h̄.

Mardanov (Kazan) Optimization of the border layer suction in the range of attack angles in this work set and solved the task of finding the optimal distribution of the suction speed of the border layer (PS) on permeable wing profiles when minimizing the CS resistance coefficient, which guarantees The uncomfortable of the flow of the profile in a given range of attack angles. The resistance coefficient cs = cv + cq; Here CV is the resistance coefficient due to viscous friction, CQ is the coefficient equivalent to the energy costs of the suction. Decision 114
