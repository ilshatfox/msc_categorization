UDC 517.956 Direct and reverse tasks of the logarithmic potential with the final number of N.P. Abubakirov1, L.A. Aksentiev2 1 nail.abubakirov@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 leonid.aksentev@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in direct tasks is known for the region and it is necessary to determine the potential gradient outside or within this area. In the reverse tasks, the potential gradient in the vicinity is known and it is necessary to determine the area D. Following V.K. Ivanov [1], we continue to highlight the classes of regions with the final number of parameters that characterize the function displaying the single circle E = {| ζ | <1} To the region D. We also consider the direct and reverse tasks for the gradient of the logarithmic potential of a simple layer with various types of contours. Key words: logarithmic potential, gradient, integral equation. §one. Direct and reverse tasks for the gradient of the potential of a simple layer 1.1 gradient of the potential of a simple layer according to the curve L will call the function u (z) = ˆ l d s (τ) τ-z, 24 materials of the international school-conference where τ ∈ L, z lies outside And if L limits the single -link area D, then with z ∈ D we get the internal potential U+(Z), with Z outside D, we get the external potential U - (Z). Consider the arc of a circle | t | = R, with the ends at the points R and reiα and calculate for it u (α, z) = α 0 rdθ rei step - z = 1 i α 0 rdeiθ (reiθ - z) eiθ = r I z [ln (re i 11 z) - iθ] ∣∣∣α 0 = r i z (ln re iα - z r - z - iα) = −αr z + r i z ln reiα - z r - z. We prove that with any α ∈ (0.2π], the function u (α, z) will not have features in 0. Indeed, u (α, z) = −αr z + r i z [lneiα + ln (1 - z (1 - z R e --iα) - ln (1 - z r)] = = −αr z + αr z + r i z [z r (1 - e --iα) + z 2 2r2 (1 - e - 2iα) + ... + z n nrn (1 - e - niα)+ ...] → 0 Produce → 2π. Therefore, u (α, z)+ i (1 - e --iα) = o (z) near Z = 0 for anyα ∈ ( 0.2π) and u (2π, z) ≡ 0 for | z | <r. In the vicinity φ, we get u (α, z) = −αr z + r ln 1 --reiα/z 1 --r/z = - αr z + r i z [ln (1 - re --iα z) - ln (1 - r z)] = = −αr z + r i z [1 - eiα) + r 2z2 (1 - e2iα) + ...+ r n nzn (1 --eniα)+ ...] −2πr z at α → 2π. Therefore, for the gradient of the potential of a simple layer on a circle | z | = r, two formulas are fair: u - (z) = −2πr/z at | z |> r and u+(z) ≡ 0 at | z | <r. 1.2ds of the gradient of the potential of a simple layer in the form of a rectangle compared to the circle. The picture is complicated. We will confirm this with appropriate calculations for the rectangle Lab with peaks at points ± a ± i b with all the combination Inasions of signs and with positive parameters A, b. u (z) = ˆ lab d s (t) t - z = ˆ a – a d x x - z + 1 i ˆ b − b --b i d y a + y - z - ˆ – a d x + b - z - 1 i ˆ ˆ b i d y – a + + d y – a + I y - z = = (1+ i) ln z - (a - i b) z - ( - a + i b) + (1 - i) ln z - (a + i b) z - ( - a - i b), ( 1) Moreover, u ( - z) = −u (z), i.e. u (z) - an odd function. In the vicinity of icles we get u - (z) = −4 (a + b) z + 4re [(1+ i) ( - a + i b) 3] 3z3 + ... - decomposition in odd degrees 1/z. The area of ​​convergence of this series will be | z | > p a2 +b2. About 0 decomposition in odd degrees Z has the form U+ (Z) = Z (−4re 1+ i A - I B)+ Z3 (−4 3 re 1+ I (A - I B) 3)+ ... N.R. Abubakirov, L.A. Aksentiev 25 with a circuit circle | Z | <p a2 +b2. 1.3, we denote through the LN the contour of the final N-angle containing inside on Chalo coordinate, with the specified peaks AK and the inner angles αK (0 <αk <2π), k = 1.2, ..., n. Let γk - the angle of inclination tangent to the side ak ak+1 and βk = ∑k j = 2α J, 2 ≤ k ≤ n. By analogy with the formula (1), we get u (z) = (−1) α1+1 (1+eiα1) ln (z – a1)+n∑ k = 2 (−1) k - 1 --βk /π (1 +eiαk) ln (z –k). (2) This function in the general case will not be even or odd. Given the submission (2), we formulate the statement and unproven hypothesis. Theorem 1. If the gradient of the potential of a simple layer in form (2) corresponds to the polygonal circuit ∂d {αk} N 1 with a set of angular points {AK} N 1 and internal angles {αK} N 1, and form (2) is removed from the existing contour , then at least one solution to the reverse problem always exists. Hypothesis. The solution to the problem from the theorem 1 will be the only in the class of convex contours. As shown by I.M. Rapoport [2], star -shaped areas do not form a class of uniqueness in the reverse task for the potential of a simple layer. §2. Direct and reverse tasks for the potential gradient in the field 2.1 gradient of the potential of a simple layer, built for four sides of a straightener, are closely associated with a gradient of the logarithmic potential for the region in the form of a DAB rectangle with the Lab border. For any Z outside DAB we get u - (Z) = ˆ DAB D XD Y T -
