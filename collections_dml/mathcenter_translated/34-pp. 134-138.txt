. Model of the unnecessary course of the current in the snot Laval E. O. Kuznetsova Saratov State University named after N. G. Chernyshevsky, Jane-83@yandex.ru are of great interest are mixed ellipa tico-hyperbolic currents associated with the transition through the speed of sound. The purpose of this work is to study the problem of gluing the SIM metric course of Meyer (M.) and the asymmetric course of 136 tomotics -tamada (T.T.) on the parabolic shock wave (uv) in the nozzle of the laval. This issue for two symmetrical currents was studied by O.S. Ryzhov [1]. He examined two cases when such a procedure is feasible. In the consideration of the current, symmetrical to the left of the HD and the asymmetric to the right of the owl, the third possible version of the glie of ki is revealed. The main system of equations characterizing a flat stream has the form UUX = VY, VX = UY.

(2) here C0, C1, C2, C3, C4, X2, B are arbitrary permanent. The symmetrical course of M. is determined by the formulas U = A1x + A21 2 Y2, V = A21XY + A31 6 Y3. (3) For gluing symmetric and asymmetric currents on UV, the following parameters are obtained in the snot: 1) x2 = −1/4x10 = −1/4, 2) x2 = 1/2x10 = 1/5, 3) x2 = −1 −1 −1 /16x10 = 1/32 (4) (x2 - curvature of UV on the axis of the nozzle, x10 - a shift of UV from the beginning of the coordinates). Here X2 is the senior coefficient, X10 is the bore value for UV for the coefficient in Y in the presentation for X in the asymmetric class of the solutions of the Zaslavsky -GRIBE. These parameters values ​​are obtained from the conditions on UV. Let us dwell in detail on the third case in (4). Used the above analytical solutions (2) and (3) (previously received the values ​​of all constants in (2) from the initial 138 conditions for UV), we managed to build gluing symmetrically and asymmetric currents on ul. In Fig. 1 course occurs from left to right, the isolines of U = const are given, which are found at the same point on UV, the sound lines U = 0 for the course of M. on the left and for the current of T-T. Rice. 1 isoline to the left of the iv have values ​​(from top to bottom): U1 = 5.92, U2 = 75.29, U3 = 137.55, U4 = 94.37, U5 = 44.63, U6 = 2.00. Izolini to the right of the UV: U0 = −4 (has no analogue during M., because it does not cross UV and is built with the aim of the best of streaming about the nature of the current after UV), U1 = −2, U2 = 0, U3 = 0, U3 = 0, U3 = 0, U3 = 0, U3 = 2.

Kuzmina Chuvash State Pedagogical University, Cheboksary, Caf_geom_chgpu@mail.ru This work is devoted to the study of some issues of the diots of the cardan m in the projective about the wanderings of P2M. In the projective space P2M, we consider the distribution of tangent elements (A0, πm) (the center A0 belongs to the corresponding plane πm). In the first-order reoper (the vertices of the rapper A0, AI are located in the corresponding plane of the distribution, and the A0 coincides with its center) the system of differential equations of the distribution of M-sized linear elements has the form ωαi = λ α Ikω K 0, I, J, K, K, K. S = 1, 2 ,. . . , m; α, β = m+ 1 ,. . . , 2m; I, k = 1 ,. . . , 2m. It is known that the distribution of M-Merged linear elements is a highonomic, and only when ten zor λαjk is symmetrical. Suppose that: 1) the number of linearly independent quadratic asymptotic forms φα = aαikω i 0ω k 0 on the distribution is equal to m, a α ij = λ α (ij); 2) distribution M carries fabric fabric, that is, the directions of the tangent to the lines of the fabric σ ⊂m are paused in pairs relative to any cone of directions φα = 0. 140
