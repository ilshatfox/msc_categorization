The laws of conservation for charged frequency moving in robbing the Actic and electromagnetic fields of A.I. Karuzin Kazan State University E-Tail: karuzin@green.kcn.ru, in the framework of the theory of Kalutsa-Klsain, the symmetry of the 5-rodous equation in the form of projective movements that preserve geodetic. Using the method of Kosonormal-Roop [1], Eisenhart equations are ritualized and all projective movements and the corresponding H-spaces with the characterization of Serre are located. With each projective movement, the preserved value of H-4TP G = const is associated, which remains constant along each 5-geodesic and, next, determines the law of preservation of the charged particle in the PIN ..

Maxwell.rra equations in a vacuum in the five -dimensional space of Kalutsa -Klane are also studied, which, after conformal transformation and physical identification, have the form: o (o o \ <7 rvµ 31 -vµ \ 7 ~ l5 zs 2 µv v; ls.s 2 ls, s u '~ l 5 1 - v - t: = jk g l t-. 15 j Literature 1.
