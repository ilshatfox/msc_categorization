Goryainov1 1 goryainov_vv@hotmail.com; The Moscow Physics and Technical Institute (State University) studies a half-group of the holomorphic displays of the strip and an isomorphic half-group of the holomorphic display of right half-plate in itself. For the holomorphic display of the strip, the fulfillment of the condition is required, which is an analogue of hydrodynamic normalization. Distortion theorems for these display were obtained and the conditions under which the areas of one -legged exist. A description of the class of display, which allow investing in single -parametric half -groups. An analogue of the Levner-Kufarev equation for the studied half-group of display was obtained and the theorem of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions for this equation was established. Keywords: holomorphic display, distortion theorems, monolithic areas, a single -parametric half -group, evolutionary family, evolutionary equation. Let F-the holomorphic display of the strip S = {z ∈C: −π/2 <π <π/2} 118 Materials of the International School-Conference in itself and RE F (X) → ± urb with X → ± urb. The invariant form of the Lemma of the Schwartz for the strip S can be recorded in the form | F ′ (Z) | COS {IM F (Z)} ≤ 1 COS {IM Z}. From this inequality it is easily derived that the function x 7 → re {x - f (x)} does not decrease on R. Thus, there are (finite or endless) limits of d ± (f) = lim x → ± و Red {x - f (x)}. In this case, D - (F) ≤ D+(F). We denote through the t class of the holomorphic display f: s 7 → S, for which d - (f) = 0 and d+(f) <mm. In fact, if f ∈ T, then for any α ∈ (0.1) in the strip Sα = {Z ∈ C: | IM Z | <απ/2} The limiting ratios of the Lim Re Z → − least (z - f (z)) = 0, lim re z →+least (z - f (z)) = d+(f) are performed. Condition (z - f (z)) → 0 with re z → − least in the form is an analogue of hydrodynamic standardization, which is accepted for conformal display of half -plate. For Δ> 0 through t (Δ) we will denote the class of functions f of t, for which d+(f) = δ. In a certain sense, the parameter Δ determines the degree of deviation of the holomorphic display f: s 7 → S from an identical transformation. In particular, for all Z ∈S, the inequality of COS (IM Z) cos (IM F (Z) ≤ Eδ/2, which can also be considered as a certain analogue of the Lemma of Schwartz, is performed. The theorems of distortion in the geometric theory of functions are understood to be evaluated by the functionals that depend on the values ​​of the function and its derivative at a fixed point, in various classes of functions. As a rule, these estimates characterize the degree of deviation of the display carried out by the functions of this class from an identical transformation. In a more general production, areas of values ​​of the corresponding functionals are studied. We fix the point Z0 in the stripes and enter into consideration for Δ> 0 two sets ωδ (z0) = {w = e [z0 - f (z0)]: f ¾}, ω ′ δ (z0) = {w = F ′ (Z0) E [z0 - f (z0)]: F ∈T (Δ)}. The description of these sets allows you to obtain estimates of deviations of display f of class t (Δ) from an identical transformation. Theorem 1. Let z0 = x0 +i y0 - fixed point in the strip S and δ> 0. Then ωδ (z0) = {w: ∣∣∣∣∣w - e δ +i y0 +e --i y0 2cos y0 ∣ ∣∣∣∣≤ E δ - 1 2cos y0, w ̸ = 1, eδ}. The description of the second set is contained in the next theorem. V.V. Goryainov 119 Theorem 2. Let Z0 = x0 + I Y0 - fixed point in the strip S and Δ> 0. Then the set ω ′ δ (Z0) is a convex shell of the curve γδ (z0) = {w = 1+ (eδ-1 ) COS2 t2 cos2 y0 ei (t+2Y0): t ∈ [0.2π], t ̸ = −2y0}. In addition, in class t (δ), δ> 0, there is an accurate inequality∣∣∣ f ′ (z) e [z - f (z)] −1 ≤ eδ - 1 cos2 (Im z). We note another property of classes t (Δ) with small values ​​Δ, which is expressed in the existence of strips of one -leaf. Theorem 3. Let F belong to the class t (Δ) and 0 <δ <2LN3. Then F is one -leaf in the strip {z: | IM Z | <y ∗ (δ)}, where y ∗ (Δ) is the only one in the interval 0 <y <π/2, the root of the equation COS2 y = (eδ - 1) COS3 π -2Y 3. Note that y ∗ (δ) → π/2 for δ → 0 and y ∗ (Δ) → 0 with Δ → 2LN3. This theorem can be considered as an increase in theorem 2 from [1]. The following results are due to the fact that class T forms a topological half -group regarding the operation of the composition and topology of the locally uniform convergence in the bands. Considering r+ = {t ∈R: t ≥ 0} as an additive half
