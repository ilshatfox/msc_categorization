An error of optimal restoration of functionals with restrictions let W is a closed balanced convex to many linear space x. Consider the problem of optimal restoration of linear functionality L based on many values ​​of linear functionals L 1,: .., ln. For F E W, we put J.F: = (l1.f, ..., LP/). Operator I: W -> JRN is called the information operator ROM. Let V - some cone in JRN. Let F (V) mean the class of all linear algorithms a: jRn -> jr, using information I, such as a (v): <: O for all V E V. The size E (l, w, i, V): = Inf Sup Ilj - a (if) j Aef (\ ') Feiv is an error of the task of optimal linear recovery of linear functionality L on the information based I F, F E W, with limitation v. Theorem. Empty W eaten a closed balanced bulk subset of the linear space x and v eat 254 centuries. in. Simonov is some ~ th cone in JR. "Then E (L, W,!, V) = SUP LF. Few, -IJEV work was performed with the financial sub-holder of the RFFIF (about ECT 07-01-00167) and the program of the President of the Russian Federation (Project 06 -01 00003). B.V. Simonov Volgograd, htf212@vstu.ru about the ratio between continuity modules in the spaces of the Lorenz function G (t) is called almost increasing (respectively almost decreasing) on ​​(o, 1] if there is such a constant constant C1> o, that g (t1) ~ c1g (t2) for O <t1 ~ t2 ~ 1 in case of almost increasing and, accordingly, g (l 1) ~ c1g (t2) in case of almost descending; g (t) is called satisfying D2 -result, if there is such a constant C2> o, that g (t) ~ c2g (t/2) for O <t ~ 1. Let q> o, n - natural number, in = [o, l] n] n , E, x = (x 1,. .., xn), function F is measurable on in; f*(t) = sup infinrai 1 f (x) (o <t ~ 1) IEL = t - non -growing on (O, 1] a function equal to LF (x) I on in. We denote through F Many positive, in an increase in increasing x and satisfying D2 -condition on (o, 1] functions <p (t) are such as <p (t) -+ o at T -+0. The space of the Lorenz l, µ, q is called many measurable on i n,
