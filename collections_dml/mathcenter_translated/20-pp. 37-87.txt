. . . Extreme CMMB-Minor 1-4 genus and methods of optimizing computational algorithms 1 V.I. Lebedev RNC "Kurchatov Institute", the Institute of Computing Mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow Introduction Methods for constructing optimal algorithms of many tasks of computing mathematics are based on the use of the properties of such polynomials, which in the work with some weight function are the least deviated from zero. The use of weight functions depending on the parameters allows you to more accurately take into account the a priori information about the properties of the class of sophisticated solutions. Examples of such tasks are, for example, the tasks of the distribution of interpolation nodes, the construction of Gaussian quadrature formulas, iterative methods, etc. [7–14, 22–24, 30, 31]. We formulate three typical extreme tasks that arise. Let W (x) = w (x, c) is continuous on [−1, 1], positive in (−1, 1) with a function from x and continuous function from parameters C = (C1, C2,., CM, CM ) In all the areas of interest to us, the changes in these variables. Let πn-a class of polynomials of the N-th degree, normalized by any additional condition, for example, with a fixed coefficient of an at x n or a given value at some point Δ> 1, x̄n = (x1,., XN)-their roots, their roots, their roots, their roots, And C̃ - many parameters C that satisfy the equations F (X̄n, C) = 0. It is required to find solutions to the following extreme tasks. Problem I.

(0.6) We indicate the four of Chebichev’s remarkable cases of extreme polynomials - solutions to the problem I. If x = cos θ, w (x) = w (x, c), and p (x) - the weight with which is polynomial on the segment [ - - 1, 1] with the norm √ π/2, and en = 1, then the polynomials of Chebyshev 1-4 of the genus are: 1st genus with W (x) ≡ 1: pn (x) = tn (x) = cosnθ, p (x) = = 1/ √ 1– x2; 2nd kind with W (x) = √ 1– x2: pn (x) = un (x) = sin (n+1) θ/ sin θ, p (x) = √ 1– x2; 3rd genus at W (x) = √ 1 + x: pn (x) = vn (x) = 2 −1/2 cos (n + +1/2) θ/cos θ 2, p (x) = √ (1 + x)/(1 - x); 4th genus with W (x) = √ 1-x: pn (x) = wn (x) = 2–1/2 sin (n + +1/2) θ/sin θ 2, p (x) = √ (1 - x)/(1 + x). These four groups of formulas can be recorded in one way. Let α, β = 0, 1/2, then with W (x) = W (x, α, β) = (1+ x) α (1 - x) β: pn (x) = cos ((n+ α + β) θ - βπ)/w (x, α, β), (0.7) p (x) = p (x, α, β) = w2 (x, α, β) (1 + x) −1/1/ 2 (1- x) −1/2. By adding the phase function ψ (θ) to the cosinus argument in the article will receive obvious generalizations of formulas (0.7) 39 Extreme CMMB-Military Millets of 1-4 genus and. . . for PN (x) (see (1.5)), called the polynomials of Chebyshev-Markov-Bernhestin-Sega [1–4], for a certain (see (1.1), (1.4)) a wider class of functions W (X, C, C ), the properties of these polynomials have been studied. It is known [5–7] that the use of the properties of the Chebyshev polynomials underlies the construction of optimal algorithms in the theory of approximations, inter -polishing, numerical integration, iterative methods on fairly wide classes of solutions. It will be shown that having additional information about the solution, it is possible to improve the parameters of many optimal methods using the mentioned polynomials. The summary content of the results of the article is contained in [8–10]. The author is grateful A.A. Klyachin, V.I. Kostenkov, D.V. Chizhikov for help in the design of the article. 1 On a single formula for the phase function of extreme Combines of 1-4 kinds of tasks II, III lies the solution of the problem I, the analytical solution of which is rarely known. However, there is a class of weight functions, everywhere dense in the cone of limited continuous positive in (−1, 1) functions for which simple analytical formulas are known for extreme polynomials. This is a class of weight functions of the type W (x) = w (x, α, β, c) = (1 + x) α (1– x) β/ √ SL (x), (1.1) where SL (x) is positive on [−1, 1] the polynomial degrees l, the coefficients, or the roots, or the degree of which can play the role of CI parameters, and α, β = 0, 1/2. Let Z and H - the planes of complex variables, respectively z and h. Consider the transformation z = 1 2 (h2 + 1 h2). (1.2) For the areas of the monolithic display, we take the quadrants D1 (h: reh> 0, imh> 0), d2 (h: reh <0, imh> 0), d3 (h: reh <0, imh <0), d4 ( H: REH> 0, IMH <0). Each 40 V.I. Lebedev region DI is displayed on a sheet ZI of the plane of a complex alternating variable with incisions from 1 doorate and from −1 to − least. We build a surface Rman Rimanov for reverse converting H (Z), which is four
