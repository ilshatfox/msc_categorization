CONSTRUCTION OF A MINIMAL PERIODIC SURFACE BASED ON HOLOMORPHIC MAP OF THE HALF-PLANE ONTO PERIODIC POLYGON  E.L. Khabarova, I.A. Kolesnikov  Fujimori S. and Weber M. gave a method for constructing embedded triply periodic minimal surfaces in the Euclidean space, based on the Schwarz-Christoffel formula for periodic polygons of strip type. This paper considers a construction method for periodic minimal surface based on holomorphic map of the half-plane onto periodic polygon of half-plane type. Keywords: minimal surface, holomorphic mapping, periodic polygon, symmetry of transfer.  UDC 517.574, 517.547  AFFINE BALAYAGE OF MEASURES WITH APPLICATIONS TO HOLOMORPHIC FUNCTIONS  B.N. Khabibullin1, E.B.

We investigate two related but different problems. The first is to find the conditions on the Riesz measures υu and µM of functions u and M respectively under which there exists a subharmonic function h ̸≡ −∞ onD such that u+h < M . The second is the same question, but for a harmonic function h on D. The answers to these questions are given in terms of the special affine balayage of measures introduced in our recent previous works. Applications of this technique concern the description of distribution of zeros for holomorphic functions f on the domain D satisfying the restriction | f | ≤ exp M . Keywords: subharmonic function, Riesz measure, balayage, holomorphic function, sequence of zeros, uniqueness set, weighted class.  In the survey [5], considered general concepts of affine balayage. In this article, we deal with a particular case of such balayage with respect to special classes of test subharmonic functions. Here we give some results from [4], [6], [3] as well as their generalizations.  As usual,N := {1,2, . . . },R, andC are the sets of all natural, real, and complex numbers, respectively. For the real line R with the Euclidean norm-module | · |,  R−∞ := {−∞}∪R, R+∞ :=R∪ {+∞}, |±∞| :=+∞; R±∞ :=R−∞∪R+∞ is the extended real line in the end topology with two ends ±∞, with the order relation ≤ on R complemented by the inequalities −∞≤ x ≤+∞ for x ∈ R±∞, with the positive real axis  R + := {x ∈R : x ≥ 0}, x+ := max{0, x}, x− := (−x)+, for x ∈R±∞,  S+ := {x ≥ 0: x ∈ S}, S∗ := S \ {0} for S ⊂R±∞, R+∗ := (R+)∗, x · (±∞) :=±∞=:(−x) · (∓∞) for x ∈R+∗ ∪ (+∞),    350 МАТЕРИАЛЫ ШКОЛЫ-КОНФЕРЕНЦИИ  x  ±∞ := 0 for x ∈R, but 0 · (±∞) := 0 unless otherwise specified. An open connected (sub-)set ofR±∞ is a (sub-)interval ofR±∞.  The Alexandroff one-point compactification of C is denoted by C∞ :=C∪ {∞} [7]. The same symbol 0 is used, depending on the context, to denote the number zero,  the origin, zero vector, zero function, zero measure, etc. Given z ∈C and r ∈R+∞, we set D(z,r ) := {z ′ ∈C : |z ′− z| < r }, D(z,r ) := {z ′ ∈C : |z ′− z| ≤ r }, D(∞,r ) := {z ∈C∞ : |z| > 1/r }, D(∞,r ) := {z ∈C∞ : |z| ≥ 1/r }, D(r ) := D(0,r ), D := D(0,1), D(r ) := D(0,r ), D := D(0,1).  Thus, the basis of an open (respectively closed) neighborhood of a point z ∈C∞ form open (respectively closed) disks D(z,r ) (respectively D(z,r )) centered at z with radius r > 0.  Given a subset S of C∞, the closure clos S, the interior intS and the boundary ∂S will always be taken relative to C∞. For S′ ⊂ S ⊂C∞, we write S′b S if clos S′ ⊂ int S. An open connected (sub-)set of C∞ is a (sub-)domain of C∞. By dist (·, ·) we denote the Euclidean distance function in C∞. So, dist (S,∞) :=+∞ for S bC.  For a subset S ⊂C, har(S), sbh(S), Hol(S) and C k (S) with k ∈N∪ {∞} are the restrictions to S of harmonic, subharmonic, and k times continuously differentiable functions in some (in general, its own for each function) open set O ⊂ C containing S, respectively. But C (S) is the class of all continuous functions on S. The class sbh(S) contains the minus-infinity function −∞ : z 7→ −∞ identically equal to −∞; sbh∗(S) := sbh(S) \ {−∞}, Hol∗(S) :=Hol(S) \ {0}, sbh+(S) := {u ∈ sbh(S) : u ≥ 0 on S}.  Let Borel(S) be the class of all Borel subsets in S ⊂ Borel(C∞). We denote by Meas(S) the class of all Borel signed measures, or, charges on S ∈ Borel(C∞); Measc(S) is the class of charges µ ∈Meas(S) with a compact support suppµb S; Meas+(S) := {µ ∈Meas(S) : µ≥ 0}, Meas+c (S) := Measc(S)∩Meas+(S); Meas1+(S) := {µ ∈ Meas+(S) : µ(S) = 1}, probability measures. We denote by δz ∈ Meas1+c (S) the Dirac measure at a point z ∈ S, i.e., with the support suppδz = {z}, δz({z}) = 1. We denote byµ  ∣∣ S′ the restriction ofµ to S  ′ ∈ Borel(C∞). Definition (of affine balayage). Let O ⊂ C be an open subset, and S0 b O. Let V be  a class of Borel-measurable functions on O \ S0. We say that a measure µ ∈ Meas+(O) is an affine balayage of a measure ν ∈ Meas+(O) outside S0 for the class V and write υ2S0,V µ if there exists a constant C ∈R such that∫  O\S0 v dν≤  ∫ O\S0  v dµ+C for all v ∈
