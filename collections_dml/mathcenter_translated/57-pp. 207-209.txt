Keywords: Van der Field method, oscillator, potential. The regimes of stationary oscillations in solving the equation of the mantting z̈ +ω2z = ενz3 +εA cosω1t = ε pan (1) (1) where ω2> 0, A> 0, ω1 0, ω1 are studied in detail (see 1, 3]). > 0, ν - constant values, ε> 0 - small parameter. Here is an analysis of non -stationary oscillator fluctuations (1), limited to the first approximation of the asymptotic method of averaging (Van der Field method). For variable van der fields (b - amplitude, ψ - phase, while z = b cosψ) we obtain the system ḃ = - ε ω (νb3 cos3ψ sinψ+a cosω1t sin), ̇̇ = ω - ε ωb (νb3 cos4ψ+a cosω1t cosψ). In the case of ω --ω1 = εh (frequencies), the indicated system is completed by the equation for the slow phase θ = ψ --ω1t. After averaging with the phases of rapid vibrations ψ and ω1t, we come to the average system for slow variables ḃ = −p 2 sinθ, θ̇ = s - 3q 8 b2 - p 2b cosθ, (2) where p = εa/ω, q = εν/ω , s = εh. From (2) follows the integral COSθ = S P B - 3Q 16P B3 + C1 B, where C1 is an arbitrary constant. Excluding θ from the system (2) using the integral, we come to the equation of the oscillator for the amplitude b b b̈ = −p 2 cosθ ̇̇ = ( - s 2 4 + 3pqc1 32) b + 3sq 16 b3 - 27q 2 1024 b5 + p2c 21 4b3 = F (b). (3) 208 Materials of the School-Conference with arbitrary initial values ​​b (0), θ (0), constant C1 is recorded as c1 = b (0) cosθ (0)-s p b (0) 2 + 3q 16p (0) 4 . Osciller equilibrium provisions - non -negative roots of equations F (b) = 0. Considering C1 ̸ = 0, from the condition COSθ = 0, we get b1.2 = √ 8α 3 ± √ d1, d1 = 64α2 9 + 16β 3, from the condition θ̇ = 0 B3.4 = √ 8α 9 ± √ D2, D2 = 64α2 81 - 16β 9. where α = S/Q, β = PC1/Q. The potential of the oscillator (3) is determined by the formula π (b) = q 2 8 (αb - 3 16 b3 + β b) 2. The analysis shows that, depending on the values ​​of the parameters α and β on the plane (α, β) there are four areas with different behavior of the potential π (b): 1) area a is in the upper half -frost and limited to the α <0 and parabox β = 4α2/9; 2) region B is also located in the upper halfness and borders on the area A, it is limited by the same parabole = 4α2/9 and the Oα CAMS PROSOUSE; 3) the region C is in the lower half -plate and adjacent to the area B, its boundaries - the oα axis with α> 0 and the parabola β = −4α2/3; 4) The region D is located in the lower half -plane, the boundaries are the specified parabol β = −4α2/3 and the oα penis with α <0. In the area A, the potential has a minimum ofπ (b1) = 0. In the region B - two minimums with π (B4) = Q2 8 (32α3 81 + 8αβ 3 - 9D2 P D2 16) and B1) = 0, separated by the patential barrier of the ROM with the maximum potential π (B3) = Q2 8 (32α3 81 + 81 + 9D2 P D2 16). In the area C - there are also two potential pits with minimal values ​​π (B2) = π (B1) = 0 and a potential barrier π height (B3). Finally, in the field of D, the potential has one minimum with π (B3). In all potential pits located in the listed areas, the equation (3) is approximately solved on the boundaries of the regions in the form of decomposition along the degrees of the initial deviation of the oscillator (the well -known Linsted method). The initial deviation is calculated using the law of preserving the energy of the oscillator (3). Note that at the border of the regions C and D, when integrating equation (3), the equivalent linarization method is used. As a result, we get non -oscillators of amplitude b. Literature 1.

Keywords: optimal control, singular disturbances, different -aimed fast variables, asymptotic decays. When constructing an asymptotic solution to the problems of optimal control, two approaches are used (see, for example, [1]). The first of them is to build an asymptotic solution of the problem arising from the conditions of the optimality of managing
