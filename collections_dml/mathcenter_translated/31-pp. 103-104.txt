. The dual tasks of linear programming and their approximation R. Sh. Mukhutdinov Kazan State University, pnb@ksu.ru Let K - the field of material numbers, x and x ′ - linear spaces over K. If non -equal bilinear functionality is <x, x ′> on X × x ′ with values ​​in K, then the spaces of X and X ′ are dual [1]. Let A: X → Y - linear operator, x, x ′ and y, y ′ - vapors of dual spaces. Operator A ′: Y ′ → X ′ is called dual to A if <x, a′y ′> = <ax, y ′> ∀x ∈ X, ∀y ′ ∈ Y ′. In linear programming, it is more convenient to use another definition. Operator A ′: Y → X ′ will call dual to A if <x, a′y> = <y, AX> ∀X ∈ X, ∀Y ERRO Y. Let X, X ′, Y, Y ′ - ordered linear spaces. Moreover, the orderlies in them are agreed: if x ′ ≥ 0, then <x, x ′> ≥ 0 ∀x ∈ P+X (p+x is a positive cone in x). 104
