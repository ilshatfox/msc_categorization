) A close solution of fractional -integrated equations, a wide class of practical tasks is reduced to fractional -integral equations with the fractional integral of Riman -Liwill (see, e.g., [1]) (iαa + ng) (t) + b∫ a h (t, τ ) mon (τ) dτ = f (t), 0 ≤ α <1, t ∈ [a, b], (1) where (iαa+onic) (t) = 1 γ (α) x∫ a onic (t ) (x - t) 1 --α dt, x> a. (2) 66 For an approximate solution of equation (1) the following computing scheme is proposed. The approximate solution is searched in the form of ement (t) = n∑ k = 0 ak (t) (i α a+onic) (tk), (3) where ak (t) are defined in [2], and tk = t (n ) K - the Kesyshev’s nodes of the first kind on the segment [a, b]. The known values ​​ck = (iαa + onic) (tk), k = 0, n are located from the system of linear algebraic equations Cj + n∑ k = 0 ck b∫ a h (tj, τ) ak (τ) dτ = f (tj), j = 0, n. (4) System permissibility (4) with sufficiently large N is indicated, the convergence of a close solution to the exact solution of the equation (1) is investigated. In particular, the theorem has been proven. Let the equation (1) are unambiguously resolved with any right side, h (t, τ) ∈ W Rhγ in both alternating ones, f (t) ∈ W Rhγ. Then the system (4) with sufficiently large N is unambiguously resolved and close solutions found according to the formula (3), converge to the exact solution onic ∗ equation (1) at a speed of ‖ intern - ∗ ∗ ‖ = o (ln2 n nr+γ).
