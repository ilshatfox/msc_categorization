Some tasks associated with the functionality of the isoperimetric type, the known isoperimetric inequality [1] b (f) = SUP ζ∈E (1- | ζ | 2) | F ′ (ζ) | 6    1 π ∫ ∫ e | f ′ (ζ) | 2 dival dη    1/2 = d (f), (1) 144 Majoring maximum conformal radius of the region f (e) its normalized area, is the basis To compare the conditions of the uniqueness of the critical point of the conformal radius RF (ζ) = (1- | ζ | 2) | F ′ (ζ) | (2) in the form of restrictions on the prenatures of the flea and the airship of the pre -vvartsan f = f ′ ′/f ′ ([2]). The idea of ​​such a comparison was first put forward by one of the authors in the context of the permanent type of Lechto (see [3]) and was implemented in [4] (see also [5]) and [6] for isperimetric expansion (1). This article is devoted to formalizing this idea with an application to a number of operators F 7 → F. 1. We introduce the necessary definitions and designations. Let H - a class of functions, holomorphic in E = {ζ ∈ C: | ζ | <1}, H0 - its subclass, distinguished by the condition of local one -leafness in E and standard standardization F (0) = F ′ (0) −1 = 0, and let U - many injections U: H0 → H that cover the Fα family (ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ) = αζ, α> 0: fα ∈ U (h0), α> 0. (3) through f, we denote the many functionals l: h → [0, +urb], satisfying the conditions: i) l (Fα) - monotonous and monotonous and monotonous and Continuous function from α ∈ [0, +∞), and L (F0) = 0 and LIM α → +ger L (Fα) = +urb; II) For any U ∈ U, the inclusion l = {f ∈ H: l (f) = 0} ⊂ u (h0) and implication f ∈ L ⇒ K (f) = 1, where k (f) (= k (F)) - the number of critical points of the conformal radius (2) for function F associated with F ratio U (f) = f. The above conditions are in the same way as (3) are necessary for the correctness of some further definitions. For l ∈ F, we consider a number of L-objects, and above all the functionality l̄: u → [0, +urb], acting according to the formula l̄ (u) = sup {l> 0: l (f) 6 l, f ∈ U ( H0) ⇒ k (f) = 1}, (4) as well as L-space l = {f ∈ H: l (f) < +urb} with “open” and “closed” L-shars of Lε (f) = {G ∈ L: l (g-f) <ε} and lε (f) = {g ∈ L: l (g-f) 6} (L-radius ε> 0 with centers at points F ∈ L) and L-spheres ∂Lε (F) = LO (F) \ LO (F). The intention of L follows from the property i) the set f: {fα} α> 0 ⊂ l for any l ∈ F. Using just introduced objects, functionality (4) 145 can be recorded as follows: l̄ (u) = SUP {L> 0: K (LL (0) ∩ U (H0)) = 1}, and in terms Unity a (l, u) = {f ∈ L ∩ U (h0): k (f) = 1} - in the form of l̄ (u) = sup {l> 0: ll (0) ∩ u (h0) ⊂ a (L, u)}. If the functionality l, m ∈ F are connected by inequality l (f) 6 m (f), f ∈ H, (5) and the image U (h0) l-is in itself, i.e. (lε (f) \ {f }) ∩ U (h0) 6 = ∅ for any f ∈ L ∩ U (h0) and ε> 0, (6) that L-g-grain M-Mnity A (M, U) is defined as ∂la (m, u ) = {F ∈ M ∩ U (h0): ∀ε> 0 {1} $ k (lε (f) ∩ u (h0))}, where m is M-space. Spring is true 1. Let L 6 m on h. Then for any u ∈ U, ε> 0 and f ∈ M are the following ratios: m ⊂ l, a (m, u) ⊂ a (l, u), mε (f. ) ⊂ lε (f), ∂ma (m, u) ⊂ ∂la (m, u) = ∂la (l, u) ∩m ⊂ ∂la (l, u). Along with the sets A (l, u) for different l, we consider the set of a (u) = {f ∈ U (h0): k (f) = 1}, independent of the presence of “L-structures” in H, as well as functionality ᾱ (u) = SUP {α> 0: α ′ 6 α ⇒ K (Fα ′) = 1} The first exit of the Fα family from the set A (U). For a number of upper U ∈ Uli, a lot of A (u) will be star -shaped by the beam Fα, α> 0, i.e., the first output is the last: ᾱ (u) = SUP {α> 0: K (Fα) = 1 }. 2. undertaken in this work, the study is concentrated around the following two tasks: 1) the problem of calculating l̄ = l̄ (u), u ∈ U, and an effective description of the intersections of L-border of the uniqueness with L̄-spheres with the center in zero; 146 2) The problem of comparison l̄ (u) and m̄ (u) for functionals l, m ∈ F, satisfying the condition (5) for various u ∈ U. In the work [2] it was established that b̄ (u) = d̄ (u) = 2, and a complete description of the intersections ∂ba (b, u) with B2 (0) and D2 (0), and ∂DA (D, U. ) - with D2 (0), where U = F ′ ′/F ′. The situation with the prenatures of the flea and a conductor for forewording the function from H0 served as the prototype of the following general scheme, which, in particular, shows that inequality (5) is always preserved when the species transition to functional (4). Theorem 1. Let U ∈ U, and the functionality l, m ∈ F satisfy the inequality l 6 m on H. Then l̄ (u) 6 m̄ (u). If ᾱ = ᾱ (u) < +φ, then m̄ (u) < +φ, and from equalities l̄ (u) = l (fᾱ) and l (Fα) = m (Fα), α> 0, the ratio l̄ follows (u) = m̄ (u). If, in addition, the image of U (H0) L-everyone is carny in itself, and L satisfies the inequality of the triangle, then crossing the boundaries ∂MA (m, u), ∂la (m, u) and ∂la (l, u) with The ball mm̄ (u) (0) is contained in the set λl, m = {f ∈ ∂mm̄ (u) (0): l (f) = m (f)}. Proof. We show that l̄ = l̄ (u) 6 m̄ (u) = m̄. The case when l̄ = 0 or m̄ = +∞, trivial. Let 0 <l̄ and m̄ < +∞. We fix the arbitrary l ∈ [0, L̄) and consider any function F ∈ U (H0) with M (F) 6 L (many of these F is not empty due to the property I) for M, (3) and (6)). Taking into account (5) we get a chain of inequalities L (F) 6 m (F) 6 L <l̄, from where k (f) = 1 according to (4).
