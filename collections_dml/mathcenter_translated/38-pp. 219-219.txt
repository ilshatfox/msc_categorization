The uniform convergence of close solutions for one weakly singular integral equation 219 is considered a poorly singular integral equation of the first kind of type 1 12 "(j-s ah =-lnlsin--jx (a) da + 271" about 2 + _.! __ f 2 1r h (s - a) x (a) DA = Y (S), (1) 27R LO Where H (T), Y (S) - known 27R -periodic functions, X (A) the desired function, and slightly singular Integral [2 "a - s JO LN / SIN 2 -LX (A) DA is understood as unacceptable. equation (1) is considered in a pair of functional spaces (V [o, 21g], v 1 [o, 27r]), introduced by the author The dissertation of the Tsium [1]. The limitations of the reverse Operator RA A- 1: V 1 ~ v. Next to the equation under consideration (1), the methods of G.LKIN and collocation are applied, establishes the conventional solutions to the exact in space V [O, 27R] and, as a result, in uniform metric.
