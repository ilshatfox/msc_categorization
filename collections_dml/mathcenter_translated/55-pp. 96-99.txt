Otarova1 1 J.TAROVA@mail.ru; Karakalpak State University in this work for the fourth order equation in a rectangular area based on the spectral method proven the theorems of the uniqueness and existence of a solution to the regional problem. Keywords: the regional task, a number of Fourier, completeness, heterogeneous conditions. 1. The setting of the problem of the vibration pipe = {(x, t): 0 <x <p, 0 <t <t} Consider the regional task for the equation uxxxx +ut t = f (x, t), (1) task A. Find In the region ω solution u (x, t) equations (1), satisfying the regional conditions u (x, 0) = ψ1 (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ p, (2) ut (x, 0) = ψ2 (x) , 0 ≤ x ≤ p, (3) u (0, t) = ng (t) (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ t, (4) u (p, t) = ng (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ t, ( 5) uxx (0, t) = onic (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ t, (6) uxx (p, t) = wor (t), 0 ≤ t ≤ t. (7) regional tasks for the equation (1 ) with homogeneous regional conditions are studied in the works [1], [3]-[5]. Determination. Let F (X, T) ∈C (ω). The function of (x, t) ∈C 2.1x, t (ω) ∩c 4.2x, t (ω) is called the regular solution of the problem A if it satisfies the conditions (2) (7) and the equation (1) in the area (1). 2. The unity of the solution of the problem of A. Theorem 1. If there is a regular solution u (x, t) problem A, then it is the only one. Proof. Let there be two solutions U1 (x, t) and u2 (x, t) tasks. Their difference satisfies the corresponding homogeneous equation (1) and, accordingly, uniform conditions (2)-(7). We denote this difference through U (x, t), i.e., u (x, t) = u1 (x, t) −u2 (x, t). (8) It is known that the functions xn (x) = √ 2 p sinorda x, λn = nπ p, n = 1.2, ... (9) form a complete orthonomated system in L2 (0, p). J.A. Otarova 97 following [2], consider the functions DN (t) = p∫ 0 u (x, t) xn (x) d x, n = 0.1, .. (10) On the basis of (10), we introduce the functions DN, ε (t) = p --ε∫ ε u (x, t) · xn (x) d x, 0 <ε <p, (11) where ε is such that such (ε, p −ε) ̸ =;. Differentting equality (11) by t twice, from equation (1) we get DN, ε ′ ′ (t) = - p --ε∫ ε uxxxx (x, t) · xn (x) d x. (12) Integrating the right side (12) four times in parts, we move to the limit at ε → 0, taking into account the corresponding homogeneous conditions (4)-(7), which follow from (8), we get DN ′ ′ (t) (t) (t) (t) = - −4n p∫ 0 u (x, t) xn (x) d x, n = 0.1, ... in the last equality, taking into account (10), we have d ′ n (t)+λ4ndn (t) = 0 , n = 0.1, ..., that is, we get an ordinary differential equation. When deciding it and taking into account the conditions (2) and (3), we have p∫ 0 u (x, t) xn (x) d x = 0, n = 0.1, .. (13) from (13) orthogonality of U (13) x, t) a complete system of functions (9). Therefore, u (x, t) ≡ 0. In force (8), we get that u1 (x, t) ≡ u2 (x, t), i.e., the only problem. The theorem has been proven. 3. The existence of a solution to the problem A. Theorem 2. If f (x, t) ∈ C 2.0x, t (ω), fxx ∈ L2 (ω), f (0, t) = f (p, t) = 0 , ∀ t ∈ [0; t], and ψ (4) 3 (x) ∈ C [0, p], ψ (5) 3 ∈ L2 (0, p) and satisfies the conditions ψ3 ′ (0) = ψ3 ′ (p) = 0, ψ3 ′ ′ ′ (0) = ψ3 ′ ′ (p) = 0; A ψ (2) 4 (x) ∈ C [0, p], ψ (3) 4 (x) ∈ L2 (0, p), and satisfies the condition of vaim ψ4 ′ (0) = ψ4 ′ (p) = 0 , then the regular solution of the problem A exists and u (x, t) ∈ C 4.2x, T (ω). (Functions ψ3 (x), ψ4 (x) are determined below.) Proof. We introduce the auxiliary function W (x, t) = onic (t)+ [onic (t) − ventral (t)] · x p+ p 2 8π2 [onic (t)+ onic (t)] × × (1–cos 2π p x) + p 2 2π2 [onic (t) − pul (t)] · (cos π p x −1+ 2x p), (14) 98 Materials of the Youth Conference then the solution to the problem in the form of the sum (x, t) = V (x, t)+w (x, t), (15) where, v (x, t) is a new unknown function. Thus, according to (15) we come to the following task: Task ã. Find in the area ω solution v (x, t) equations vxxxx + vt t = g (x, t), (16) satisfying the regional conditions V (0, t) = v (p, t) = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ t, (17) vxx (0, t) = vxx (p, t) = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ t, (18) v (x, 0) = ψ3 (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ p, ( 19) vt (x, 0) = ψ4 (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ p, (20) where ψ3 (x) ≡1 (x) −W (x, 0), 0 ≤ x ≤ p, ψ4 (x ) ≡≡2 (x) −Wt (x, 0), 0 ≤ x ≤ p, according to (15). We look for the solution of equation (16) in the form of a series V (x, t) = φ∑ n = 0 vn (t) · xn (x), (21) where xn (x) are defined in (9). Then we get the equation vn ′ ′ (t)+λ4n vn (t) = gn (t), n = 0.1, ..., which determines the functions VN (t). Its solution has the form: vn (t) = an (0) cosλ2n t + bn (0) sinλ2n t + 1 λ2n t∫ 0 gn (τ) sinord (t –τ) dτ, n = 1.2, .. . v (x, t) = √ 2 p φ∑ n = 1 an (0) cosλ2n tbn (0) sinorda t + 1 λ2n t∫ 0 gn (τ) · sinord (t −τ) dτ  · Si nλn x. (22) Unknown coefficients AN (0), BN (0) we find using (19), (20): an (0) = √ 2 p p∫ 0 ψ3 (x) sinorda x, n = 1.2 ,. .. BN (0) = √ 2 p 1 λ2n p∫ 0 ψ4 (x) sinorda xd x, n = 1.2, ... J.A. Otarova 99 Takimobras, the solution to the problem is presented in the form (22), where an (0), BN (0) are determined by the formulas given above. Therefore, we built a formal solution to the problem ã in the field ω,
