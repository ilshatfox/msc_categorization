. Dual regulator in the reverse task of final observation for the thermal conductivity equation F. A. KUTERIN Nizhny Novgorod State University, xredor@yandex.ru The report is dedicated to discussing the dual regulatory algorithm, namely, regulatory of the unceasing data of the classical dual algorithm of Udzava [1] for solving the reverse Thermal conductive tasks. The algorithm consists in the direct solution based on the gradient method of dual to the initial reverse task and is designed to restore the distributed right part 83 of the thermal conductivity equation. Iterative regulatory of the proposed algorithm is discussed. The results of the computer program implementing the iterative regulatory algorithm are given. This algorithm is designed to restore the right side of the equation. Let d ≡ {u ∈ Linger (Qt): U (x, t) ∈ U P. c. on Qt}, U - a closed convex set in RM, Qt ≡ (a, b) × (0, t). The reverse task of the final observation is considered in the case of the first regional task for the thermal conductivity equation ZT - zxx + u (x, t) = 0, z (x, 0) = z0 (x), x ∈ (a, b), (1) z (a) = z (b) = 0, which consists in the approximate finding of a normal, i.e., the minimum in the norm, the coefficient (distributed right side) u ∈ (D) by the observation of Q = Z (·, the observation of the observation at the final moment of time T) ∈ L2 (A, B). This task can be reformed in the form of an equivalent task of optimal management: i0 (u) → Inf, i1 (u) = q, u ∈ D, Q ∈ H = L2 (ω), (PQ) where i0 (u) = || U || 22, qt, i1 = z [u] (·, t). Taking into account the approximate task of the initial data, we have instead of the task (PQ), the family depending on the error of their task δ of the tasks i0 (u) → Inf, i1 (u) = hafa + q, u ∈ D, Q ∈ H = L2 (ω). For this task, it is possible to determine the functionality of the lagrange lδq (u, λ) ≡ i0 (u) + 〈λ, zδ [u] (·, t) - haf q〉, u ∈ D, λ ∈ L2 (ω), and dual The task V ΔQ (λ) → SUP, λ ∈ L2 (ω), V ΔQ (λ) ≡ min u] 84 Dual regulators consists in a direct solution on the basis of a gradient method of the indignant dual problem of Rδ, αq (λ) = v δ q (λ) - α λ || 22, ω → max, λ ∈ L2 (ω) regulating according to Tikhonov. It is important to note that for the classic algorithm of Uzavava, the existence of the saddle point of the Lagrange functionality of the corresponding task of optimal control is necessary. The proposed algorithm works both in the case of the saddle point, and in the event of its absence. In addition, the dual algorithm, unlike the classic algorithm, is stable to the errors of the source data. Examples of solving a specific reverse problem with the described method are also considered. For the solution, a computer program written by the author was used.
