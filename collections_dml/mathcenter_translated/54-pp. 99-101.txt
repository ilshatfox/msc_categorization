Lomonosov in the work examines orthotoxy decompositions according to the systems of binary compressions and shifts of a fixed function. The convergence in L2 of orthotorcurgery decompositions by the Potachi Systemam was proven. Kudryavtsymia.v. Politov, however, the question of convergence remained open almost everywhere. This work provides a general result of convergence almost everywhere of orthotorcursive decompositions for binary compression and shifts. Keywords: orthotorcursive decomposition, compression and shifts, convergence almost everywhere. Orthorecursive decays introduced by T.P. Lukashenko in 2000-2001 [1, 2], are a natural decomposition scheme, generalizing the classic decomposition into the rows of Fourier and included as an integral part into purely greedy decompositions and their generalizations [3]. Recall the definition of orthotorcursive decompositions. Let H - the space with a scalar work (in this work, the case of spaces over the field of real numbers is considered), {en} و = 1 - the system of single elements h, f - element h. We determine inductively the sequence of residues {rn} و = 0 and the sequence of the coefficients {f̂n} و = 1: r0 = f; f̂n+1 = (rn, en+1), rn+1 = rn - f̂n+1en+1. Definition. A row φ∑ n = 1 f̂nen is called an orthorexide decomposition (orthore by a curly row of Fourier) of the element F according to the system {en} mmn = 1. It is easy to notice that the detachment of orthotorcurgery decomposition to the decomposed element is equivalent to the convergence of the residue of the decomposition to zero. For orthotorcursive decompositions, as for decompositions into the rows of Fourier according to orthonomated systems, the sequence of the coefficients {f̂n} و ℓ2 belongs to the ℓ2 space, and the equality of the parsheval و = 1 f̂ 2n = ∥ f ∥2 is performed if only if it takes place The decay of decomposition to the decomposed element. An interesting case of non-targeted systems, from the point of view of orthotorcursive decays, is the systems of binary compression and shifts of fixed functions 100 Materials of the International School-Conference [4]. Determine them by putting H = L2 [0.1]. Let the ffic is an arbitrary function lying in L2 [0.1] and having a single L2-Norm. Dominate it with zero outside the segment [0.1] and put wor, j (x) = ∗2k+ j (x) = 2 k 2 accord (2k x - j) (k = 0, 1, 2., J = 0, J = 0, J = 0, J = 0, 1,.., 2k −1). The resulting system {wor (x) φn = 1, which is normalized in L2 [0.1], is called a system of binary compression and shifts generated by the function ∗ (x). A.Yu. Kudryavtsev and A.V. Politov [5, 6] showed that if 1 ° 0 onic (x) dµ ̸ = 0 (this condition is necessary for the completeness of the system {onic (x) φn = 1 in l 2 [0.1]) and additional but additional A fairly weak condition has been fulfilled for the continuity of the generating function φ∑ k = 1 ω22 (∗, 2 −k) <mm (where ω2 is the integral continuity module in L2), then for each element f ∈ L2 [0.1] its orthotorsky expansion of the expansion. According to the system {wor (x)} و = 1 converges to f according to norm l2. However, for the functional spaces and, in particular, the L2 spaces in the study of decompositions along with the question of convergence, the question arises of the question of the convergence of almost everywhere. For some systems - first of all, the system of characteristic functions of binary intervals and its generalizations - such results were noted by the authors earlier [2.7]. But it turns out that convergence is almost everywhere a common property in Ortorkursive decomposition of the continuous function of the function in a wide class of systems of binary compression and shifts. More specifically, the following theorem takes place. Let the function onic (x), which generates the system of binary compression and shifts, is non -negative on the segment [0.1] and satisfies the condition (or the condition of the Hölder with an arbitrary positive indicator) on this segment, and the function f ∈ L2 [0.1] is almost continuous everywhere. Then the orthotorcursive decomposition of the function F (x) according to the system of binary compression and shifts {onic (x) urb = 1 converges to f (x) almost everywhere on the segment [0.1]. A key role in the proof of the theorem is played by Lemma, which is essentially associated with the consideration of the local (from the point of view of the segment [0.1]) the property of the decomposition coefficients. This Lemma can be formulated as follows. For the binary-irrational point X and the whole non-negative K through NK (X), we denote this natural number n = 2k + j (j = 0, 1,., 2k −1), which x ∈ [J 2K, J +1 2k]. In other words, NK (X) is the index of the binary segment of the k-th pack containing point X. V.V. Galatenko, T.P. Lukashenko, V.A. Sadovnichy 101 Lemma. Row φ∑ k = 0 f̂ 2NK (x) 2K converges for almost all x ∈ [0.1]. It seems that the above theorem allows further generalizations related to the weakening of conditions as a generating function onic (in particular, this refers to the refusal of the requirement of the pitch, as well as the weakening of the condition of Hölderovo
