) Some extreme tasks in the class of display with a symmetry of transfer, let XT2π is a class of holomorphic one -leaf display F, set in the upper half -frost and satisfying conditions F (z+2kπ) = f (z)+kt, k ∈ Z, t ∈ (0;+ ∞) and lim Im z →+و (f (z) --z) = 0. In the work [1] it is shown that the display f (z) = lim τ τ τ τ τ τ φ (ζ (z, τ) - iτ), where ζ (z, τ) is the solution of the equation of the type of levner dζ (z, τ) dτ = ctg λ (τ) - ζ (z, τ) 2 137 with the initial condition ζ (z, 0) = z and λ (τ) - Continuous numerical display form a dense subclass in the XT2π class. This allows you to solve extreme problems in the XT2π class. From the Levner equation, we have F (Z) - Z = E - IM Z∫ 0 Y - ρ 1- ρ2 dρ, ln f ′ (z) = −2 e - Im z∫ 0 (y - ρ) dρ (1- Yρ ) (1- ρ2), where y = y (ρ) is the control function, | y | = 1. For F of a dense subclass, the following results take place. Theorem 1. ∀f ∈ XT2π and Z = IB are valuable estimates 2 ln 2 SH (b/2) ≤ IM F (IB) ≤ 2 ln 2 ch (b/2), th (b/2) ≤ | F ′ (IB) | ≤ cth (b/2). Equality is achieved on the functions of Lobachevsky [2]. Theorem 2. ∀f ∈ XT2π and Z = Ib are fair assessment | Ref (IB) | ≤ ln cth (b/2), | Arg F ′ (IB) | ≤ ln cth (b/2). L and T R A T R A 1.
