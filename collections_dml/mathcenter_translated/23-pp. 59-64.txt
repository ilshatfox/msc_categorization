Permissible sets of the author studied the ratios between the ratios of the properties of the descriptive theory of sets on permissible sets. For this, methods of both the classical theory of computing and the theory of sets and the theory of models are used. First, we recall some basic definitions. Model a signature σ, σ ⊇ {∈} is called a permissible set if A is the model KPU and 〈| A |, ∈〉 Fundamally. We limit ourselves to the consideration of the permissible sets of only the final signature. An important example of the permissible set is the hereditary final superstructure. Let M - the signature model τ with the main set m. Then • HF0 (m) = m; • hfn+1 (m) = hfn (m) ∪ pω (hfn (m)), where n <ω, pω (x) is many final subsidence of the set X; • HF (m) = ⋃n∈ Pi (m). In this case, HF (M) is a hereditary superstructure over the model M, considered as a signature model τ ∪ {u, ∈}, where UHF (m) = = m. On permissible sets, A-B can be set. n. (a-B.) predicates as predicates defined in a σ formulas (σ- and π formulas at the same time). Partial function F is called A-calculated if γf-a-v. p. Predicat. It is known that a is a σ-subject on HF (M) over the Model M of the final signature τ, if only if it can be 61 specified by some computable (in the classical sense) sequence {an} nĕ sets consisting of hedel numbers ∃ -color signature form τ. Let A and B - permissible sets. We will say that a eS is to B (and denote as a ve b), if there is such a display ν: | b | on → | A | that ν-1 (c) will be binary b-v. p. Predicate for any binary a-v.p. Predicate C. Let A - permissible set. The family s ⊆ p (| a |) is called computable in a if there is such a binary a-v. p. Predicat Q, that S = {{b | Q (a, b)} | a ∈ | A |}. A-v. The function f (x, y) is called universal if for any one-scale partial A-B. The functions ψ are such a ∈ | a | that f (a, y) 'ψ (y). Any allowable set A contains ω as A-B. subset. Through Le and J (LE) we will denote the upper half-sections of e-spectacles and ideals of e-spectacles of subsets ω is correspondingly. Let S - a family of predicates of arbitrary nature. The principles of uniforms, reduction, separation and continuity are understood for S in a conventional smell. S satisfies the principle of enforcement, if for any non -empty a ∈ S there is such F: ω on - → A, that γf ∈ S. S satisfies the principle of quasi -cesspiability, if for any a ∈ S there is such f: b⊆ω on - → a, that γf ∈ S. They say that the permissible set satisfies the principle P if the family of all A-B. p. Predicates satisfies p. They say that the ideal i ∈ J (le) satisfies the principle P if ∪i satisfies p. 1. The design “Permissible sets 7 → Hereditary final superstructures” theorem 1 (2004). For any permissible set A there is such a model MA signature {Q4}, that 1. A ≡E HF (MA); 2. A is listed, if only if HF (MA) is listed; 62 3. A quasi, if only if HF (MA) is quasi -list; 4. A satisfies the principle of uniforms, if only if HF (MA) satisfies the principle of uniforms; 5. A satisfies the principle of reduction, if only if HF (MA) satisfies the principle of reduction; 6. A satisfies the principle of separation, if only if HF (MA) satisfies the principle of separation; 7. A satisfies the principle of continuation, if only if HF (MA) satisfies the principle of continuation; 8. A has a universal A-B. The function, if only if HF (MA) has a universal HF (MA)-in. function. 2. The design “j (le) 7 → hereditarily final superstructures” theorem 2 (2002; A. S. Morozov, V. G. Puzarenko). Let A - permissible many. Then the A-B family. n. subset ω is closed relative to E-prodigal and operation ⊕. We denote through IE (A) the family of e-spectacles of all A-B. n. subset ω. From theorem 2 it follows that IE (A) will be an element j (le). Through SaP (a), we denote the class of all the submarines computers in the families ω. Drying 1. Let the permissible sets A and B are such that a ve b. Then sω (a) ⊆ sω (b). In particular, IE (A) 6 IE (b). Theorem 3 (2002; A. S. Morozov, V. G. Puzarenko). For any ideal I ∈ J (LE), such a class Ki is elementary equivalent to hereditary final buildings that IE (A) = I for any A ∈ KI. Theorem 4 (2002–2004). For the sequence {ki} ief (le), built for the proof of theorem 3, the following is true: 1. For any permissible set A, there is such HF (m0) ∈ Kie (a) that hf (m0) ve a a; 63 2. I satisfies the principle of separation (continuity), if only if HF (M0) satisfies the principle of separation (continued) for any HF (m0) ∈ Ki; 3. I has a universal function, if only if HF (M0) has a universal HF (M0)-in. function for any HF (m0) ∈ Ki; 4. HF (M0) does not satisfy the principle of reduction for any i ∈ J (le) and hf (m0) ∈ Ki. The term “i has a universal function” is understood in the following sense. Theorem 5 (2002). Let hf (m0) ∈ Ki, i ∈
