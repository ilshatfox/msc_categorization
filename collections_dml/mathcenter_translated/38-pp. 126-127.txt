The general integrating multiplier for the family of differential forms in the theory of differential equations is well known for the task of finding an integrating factor for the Pfaff equi [lj. When solving this problem, the inherent and sufficient conditions are indicated that ensure that for the differential form of the first order, the existence of the function I (x) (integrating the multiplier) is that the form I (x) W (x) is closed. This task finds applications in a number of sections of mathematics and in theoretical physics [2j. I.V. Zhuravlev, A. Yu. Igumnov 127 in the work of [s], issues are studied closely related to the camp with the task considered above. Let W 1, ..., WN family of differential forms of the first order, which are determined in the single -link area D of space R N (n ~ 2) and have smooth coefficients. In the [ZJ, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a general integrating multiplier for the W1 family are found. .., wm. The integrating factor was found in explicitly. The report discusses the possibility of strengthening these result of Tats based on ideas and techniques developed in [4] when studying the task of restoring the display according to the normalized Jacobi matrix.
