Let E ++ P be part of the P-Miner Euclidean space, where XP-1> 0, XP> 0, D is the final area in E ++ P, limited by the surface γ and parts γ0 and γ1 planes XP-1 = 0, XP = 0, respectively, C kb l (D) - many functions k times continuously differentiated in D and satisfying the condition ∂u ∂xl = o (1) for xl → 0. The designations are used: x = (x ′, xp), x ′ = (X ′ ′, xp-1), x ′ ′ = (x1, x2,., XP-2)- Euclidean space points, de = e ++ p \ D. In this work for degenerating b- Elliptic equation MB [u] = xmp (∆x′u + bxp - 1u) + ∂ 2u ∂x2p −2xmp u = 0, (1) in which teander ′ = p - 2∑ l = 1 ∂2 ∂x2 l - Laplasian, bxp - 1 = ∂2 ∂x2p - 1 + k xp -1 ∂xp -1 - the operator of Bessel, m> 0, k> 0, p ê 3, λ ∈R, the following regional tasks were studied: internal regional regional Neumann's task.

ON THE. Ibragimova, E.A. Utkina 157 The external regional task of the Neumanum. To put in the field of the DE solution of equation (1) that satisfies the conditions U (x) ∈C 2 b p - 1 (de) ∩c 2 b p (de) ∩c 1 (de), u ( x) = o (1) for xp → 0, a [u] ∣∣ γ = g (₽), g (ă) ∈C (γ), and at the infinity u (x) = o (e -ρ0), where ρ20 = ∣∣x ′ ∣∣2+4 (m+2) 2 x m+2 p. The aim of the study is to proof the existence of the only solution to the set tasks. The solution of the equation (1) is searched in the form of V (x) = γ γ µ (μ) z (ă, x) oring - 11dγ, (3) where z (x, x0) = βck π 0 cγ π 0 ρ- 0 ρ- ν ventral (λρә) sinγ - 1 etll  sink - 1phously - the fundamental solution of the equation (1) with a feature at the arbitrary point x0, kν (λρә) - the function of the macdonald, cmb (γ+1 2) p π [2) , Ck = γ (k+1 2) p πγ (k 2), ν = p+k+γ–22, γ = mm+2, ρ2 accord = | x ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ 0 | 2+x2p - 1 +x2p --10–2xp --1xp - 10 cos accord+4 (m+2) 2 (x m+2 p+xm+2p0 −2x m+2 p x m+2 2 p0 cos accord). The limit values ​​of potential (3) and its normal derivative on the border of the region were investigated. Using them, as well as the regional condition (2), regarding the unknown density µ (₽), we make integral equations for the internal and external boundary tasks of the neuman with a nucleus with a weak feature. Applying the alternative to Fredgolm alternative to the obtained equations, we prove that homogeneous integral equations corresponding to heterogeneous have no zero solutions. Consequently, heterogeneous storage, and at the same time regional tasks, are definitely resolved. Thus, the theorem is true. If γ is the surface of Lyapunov and forms with the planes XP -1 = 0, XP = 0 there are straight angles, then the internal and external regional tasks of the Neumann have the only solution for any boundary data from CC (γ) and the solution of each can be represented as the potential of a simple layer.
