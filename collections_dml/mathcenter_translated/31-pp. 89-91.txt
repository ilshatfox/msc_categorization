). The regulatory dual algorithm in the quadratic task of the optimal management of M. I. Lisachenko Nizhny Novgorod State University, lismisha@yandex.ru The report is devoted to the regulatory of the classic uzawa algorithm in the quadratic task of optimal management with very convex functionality and linear restrictions. Let U be a convex compact in RR, D ≡ {U ∈ LIU [T0, T]: U (T) ∈ U P. B. on [t0, t]}. The problem I0 (u) → min, II (u) = 0, i = 1, m, II (u) ≤ 0, i = m + 1, k, (1) i0 (u) ≡ ∫ t0 (〈〈〈〈〈〈〈≡ 〈≡ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ A0 (t) x [u], x [u] (t)〉+ 〈b0 (t) u (t), u (t)〉) dt, ii (u) ≡ t0 (〈ai (t), x [u] (t)〉+ 〈bi (t), u (t)〉) dt, i = 1, k, 89 x [u] (t) ∈ Rn, t0 <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t <t - Solving the problem of the Koshi ẋ = a (t) x (t) + b (t) u (t) + c (t), x (t0) = x0. Determine the dual to (1) task V (λ) → SUP, λ ≡ (λ1,., Λk) ∈ Rm × Rk - M+, where V (λ) ≡ min uorn L (u, λ), u [ λ] ≡ argmin {l (u, λ): u ∈ D}, l (u, λ) ≡ i0 (u) + k∑ i = 1 λiii (u). In accordance with [1], the regolarized algorithm of Udzavas lies in the direct solution of the problem Rα (λ) ≡ v (λ) - α | λ | 2 → max, λ ∈ Rm × Rk --m+, α> 0. λα ≡ argmax {rα ( λ): λ ∈ Rm × Rk --m+} shows that with the desire to zero the regulatory parameter α, the regulatory decisions U [λα] converge as the problem (1), regardless of whether the saddle point of the Lagrange functionality exists. The specified convergence is also preserved in the event of an error in the task of the initial data of the task (1). However, the indicated error should strive for zero in agreement with the regulatory parameter. I thank my supervisor prof. M.I. Sumin for setting the task and attention to work.

The regulatory dual method of solving the reverse problem of the final observation for the parabolic equation. // ZhVM and Matt. - 2004. - T. 44. - No. 11. - C. 2001–2019. The extrapolation description of the Martsinkevich spaces and the convergence of the orthogonal series K.V. Lykov Samara University work is a continuation of research [1] - [4] and is devoted to the applications of the theory of extrapolation. Some classes of symmetrical spaces are considered on [0, 1], the norm in which is determined by LP-Norms. Let F - Banakhovo ideal space of functions defined on [1, و). Then you can consider the set of LF all functions X (t), for which cil = lection (p): = ‖x‖p ∈ F. It is easy to show that this is a set (with the usual identification of functions equal to almost everywhere) becomes a symmetrical space, if we determine the norm ‖X‖‖LF: = ‖ă‖f in it. If w = w (p) is a positive function on [1, least), then through f (w) we will denote the space of the functions x = x (t) with the norm ‖x‖‖f (w) = ‖x · w‖f. Theorem 1. Let m (∗) - the space of the Marcinkevich with the fundamental function ∗ (t), m0 (gment) - its separatic part, ∗ (t) = t/gment (t). Then the following conditions are equivalent: 91
