) The discreteness of the spectrum of the Schrödinger operator on curved works we will consider the Rimano variety Z, isometric work X × Y (where x and y are arbitrary diversity of dimensions n and m, respectively) with metric DZ2 = DX2 + γ2 (x) DY2, where γ (x) - C1 - a bit positive function, DX2 and DY2 - metric on X and Y, respectively. Such diversity zs are called curved Riman works. Let the Borelev measure µ are set on z. We will assume that µ has a density σ (z), where σ (z) = τ (x) η (y), τ (x) and η (y) - c1 - cordous positive functions. Consider the weight diversity (Z, µ) and OPE 103 Schrödinger Rator on it: l = −div∇+ c (x). We need this operator to be semi -boundary, the poet will assume that c (x)> −k (k = const). Next, we believe that the spectrum of the Laplace - Belpami Operator −∆Y on diversity Y discrete. We denote λi (y) - its own values ​​−avy, ordered by increasing, and each repeated according to its multiplicity. For the wording, we denote ν - amer with the weight of γm (x) τ (x) on diversity X. Then, through the A0, we denote the operator of Laplace - Belmers on the variety of x with a measure ν, and the Schroddinger operator associated with it is through b0 = a0 + c (x ). Theorem. The Schrödinger operator on diversity (Z, µ) has a discrete spectrum and only when the spectrum of the operator B0 + λ1 (y) − −2 is discrete in diversity (x, ν). This theorem is a generalization of the results [1] and [2]. The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (project No. 03 01-00304). L and T R A 1. Baider A.
