The solution of the Integr Al legs on the equation of the first kind with uncertain parameters considers the integral equation of the type 1! +1 gx = - p (t) ln lt - tjx (t) dt + l sin vt = y (t) - 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: :::; T ::::; 1, (1) where y (t) is given, x (t) - the desired functions, v f. O - given, l - the desired parameter, p (t) = (1 - t) ± 112 (1 + t) 'f1/2. Following the developed b. G. Gabdulkhaev [1] of the method of research, we choose a pair of spaces of the desired elements of x and right parts U, in which the task of solving the weak -raised integral equation (1) is evident correctly set. Let l2, p = l2, p [-1, 1] space quadratically summarized functions on the segment [-1, 1] with a weight p (t). Denote through x = l2, p e1e r - the space of vector -function x (t) = {x (t); L} with the components x E L2, p, l e IR, and through y = wi, q - the space of absolutely continuous functions that have the first about the heads of L2, Q, Q (T) = 1/ P (T). The norms in these spaces are determined by the CJSC: 1 llxllx = llxl/2p + ich l/xl/2p = {/: 1 p (t) lx (t) l 2 dt} 3, llyllo = max jy (t)!. -19 :::::; 1 Let TK (t), rk (t), qk (t) - polynomes, orthogonal on [-1, 1] with scales, respectively (1 - t2) - 1/2, p (t) , q (t), and with ~ (ip) = 2/1; _ 1 p (t) rp (t) rk (t) dt. Theorem. Let the pair. The meter v #- o The same, 'that with ~ (cos vt) # O. Then, with the Jelub of the right part, the equation (1) has 167 unity of resolution x (t) = {x (t ), L} e x, and 00 00 x (t) = l 'cf (y') qk (t) -> .. 11 l 'cf (cos 11t) qk (t), k = o k = o l = ± ln 2s § '(y') + cj '(y), ln 211s §' (cos 11t) where the stroke of the z'nakus means that the compulsory lines. Io at K = O should be divided into 2. The consequence . In the conditions of the theorem Operating. Or with: x -7 at I.M.Erp is cut. M, where is m {21g '? T/11i + 2 21g'? T/11i + 2} = max 1g + y '?

Based on this theorem and its consequences: for: equations kx = gx + vx = y (x e x, u u) 'where V: x -7 has a completely continuous operator, are used and theoretically substantiated in the selected spaces and projection spaces Resolution methods.
