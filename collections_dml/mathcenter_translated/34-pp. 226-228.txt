. The structural properties of turing degrees containing the final pumping combinations of the listing sets of M. M. Yamaleev Kazan State University, marsiam2@yandex.ru are considered 2-calculated (for briefly 2- С.p., see also [1]) and also [1]) 3 - В.p. sets and their list of pureness regarding V.P. and 2 - В.p. sets. In theorems 1 and 4, the enforcement of sets is studied relative to V.P. many, and this issue is completely resolved. Some facts about the enforcement of 2 - С.p. The theorems 5 and 6 are given sets. Theorem 1. For an arbitrary 2 - С.p. sets a of its own 2 - В.p. The degree exists that is not comparable to it V.P. A lot of C, such that a V.P. Regarding C. The next two theorems proven in the articles of Arslanov, La Fort, Slavaman [2] and Lemppa, Dooni, La Fort [3], respectively, are well known. Theorem 2. Let A ω - B.P., C V.P., C 6T A and A ∈ σC1. It has 2 - В pp. degree. 228 Theorem 3. There is 3 - B.P. A lot of A of the actual 3 - В.p. degree, such that for all V.P. The sets of the multi -variety A has σW1 -a spectacle and only when W ≡T 0 ′. Theorem 2 indicates that for N - С.p. (n> 3) sets from the actually n - С.p. The degrees do not make sense to consider the listness regarding V.P. sets located under them. Theorem 3 proves 0 ′ ′ ′ - priority reasoning and is the strongest result for the transmission relative to V.P. sets. A weaker version of the theorem 3 by the 0′ -Prio Riteta is proven, and this allows us to demand from the set A of theorem 4 additional properties. For example, a can be built over any V.P. The degree or a can be built such that the jump a will be equal to the jump in the specified V.P. sets. Theorem 4. There is 3 - В.p. A lot of A of the actual 3 - В.p. degree, such that for all V.P. The sets are many a ∈ σW1, and only when W ≡T 0 ′. In addition, some structural properties of turing degrees and the enemy relative to 2 - С.p. are considered. sets. The theorem 5. There is such a 2 - С.p. The set A = = A1 - A2 from the actual 2 - С.p. The degree that the sets a, A1, A2 are not comparable. Theorem 6. There is 3 - С.p. A lot of A, such as for any 2 - В.p. sets b: a ∈ σb1 → a 6t B. As a result, from here it is possible to obtain a fundamental once -of Lahlan sets for 2 - С.p. and 3 - В.p. sets.
