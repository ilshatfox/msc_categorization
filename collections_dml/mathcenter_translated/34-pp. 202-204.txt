The regulatory properties of the principle of Maxim Pontryagin for systems with approximately known initial data of E.V. Trushin Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, lenatr@bk.ru is well known that the principle of maximum Pontryagin was the result of the needs of purely applied research. During the time after its discovery, the theory of the necessary conditions of optimality was significant developed [1], [2]. Nevertheless, in the vast majority of works, the theory of the necessary conditions in optimal management, the tasks of which are exactly from the messenger are considered. At the same time, the needs of numerous applications inevitably lead to the need to study the tasks of the OPALIAL Directorate in situations where their initial data are known only approximately. However, in this case, in terms of classical optimal management, it “loses its meaning”, because in the “indignant” task it is not to exist, and in the case of existence it is not entirely in the good way, what “attitude” it has to The initial optimal man of the control of a unperturbed task. The situation is cardinal but changes if, as a “desired” element of the theory, to consider minimizing sequences of permissible departments. The use of minimizing sequences may be considered from uniform positions both the tasks for which their outraged analogues have no classic solutions, as well as the tasks with indignations solved in the classic 204 SKO sense. The use of minimizing sequences is also justified because they always exist, conveniently with an applied (engineering) point of view, carry a regulating principle and, in fact, they are used in essence in the theory of numerical methods of optimal management, in the theory of regulators incorrect tasks. The report considers the parametric task of optical control i0 (u) → Inf, i1 (u) 6 p, i2 (u) = q, p ∈ Rk, Q ∈ RL, (1) where u ∈ D ≡ ≡ & lmool (0, t): u (t) ∈ U P.V. on (0, t)}, u ⊂ rm - compact, i1 (u) = (i1.1 (u),.., i1, k (u)), i2 (u) = (i2.1 (u ),., I2, l (u)), ii (u) ≡ t 0 fi (t, x [u], u (t)) dt + φi (x [u] (t) ), I = 0, 1, 2, X [u] - the solution to the problem of the cat ẋ = a (t) x+b (t) u (t), x (0) = x0, t ∈ [0, t], x ∈ Rn. The initial data of the tasks (1) satisfy the conditions traditional for the theory of optimal management and are considered to be approximately approximately. In this situation, the following main ones are discussed: 1) the necessary and sufficient conditions for minimizes of the rising sequences; 2) the regulatory properties of the principle of the maximum of Pontryagin and minimizing after conveying; 3) of of the end-strife approximation of the task (1) and minimizing sequences; 4) minimizing sequences and parametric optimization. Illustrative examples are considered. 205 thank my supervisor of Professor M.I. Sumin for setting the task and attention to work.
