The Problem of Multiple Interpolation in the Class of Analytical Functions of Finite Order in the Half-Plane K.G. Malyutin, M.V. Kabanko The Aimof this Paper Is to Study the Problemofmultiple Interpolation in the Class of Analytical Functions of Finite Order ρ> in the Half-Plane. The Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Its Solvability in Terms of the Canonical Nevanlinna Product of Nodes of Interporation Are Obtained. The Solution of the Interpolation Problem Isstructed in the Form of the Generalized Jones Interpolation Series, That is a Generalization of the Lagrange Interporation Series. Keywords: Multiple Interporation, Divisor, Nevanlinna Product, Jones Interporation Series. UDC 517.54 on differential properties of display with the S-medium characteristic of A.N. Malyutina1, A.V. Novik2 1 nmd@math.tsu.ru; Tomsk State University, Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics 2 Novik.anastasiia@mail.ru; Tomsk State University, Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics in the work, we continue to develop a geometric method for studying the differential properties of display with an medium characteristic. Key words: spatial, display, geometric, averaged, characteristic, differential properties. We continue to explore the display with the S-medium characteristic (see [1]). Consider an example. Let D ⊂ R3 - the area determined in the following way D = {x ∈ R3; 0 <| x1 | <Imes, 0 ≤ x2 ≤ | x1 | β, 0 ≤ x3 ≤ 1}, where 0 <β ≤ 2. Let f: d → d ∗, f (x) = {y ∈ R3; y1 = x1, y2 = x2 | x1 | +1, y3 = x3 (| x1 | +1) 1–α}, where d ∗ = {y ∈ R3; −mber <y1 <+urb, 1 ≤ y2 <| X1 | β, 1 ≤ y3 ≤+φ}, 0 <α <1. We showed that the constructed display is a display with a saint characteristic, therefore, the class of the studied display is not empty, and is not a display with a limited distortion. The following results are also established in the work. Theorem 1. Let the area d ⊂ rn, f: d → rn, f = (f 1, f 2, ..., f n)-display with S-medium characteristic, such as f IK ∈ W 1 n+εk, LOC (D), εk> 0. Let A = [1 +∑n K = 1 (n +εk) −1 −mn - 1] −1 ≤ k ≤ m <n, s> a (a −1) −1,1 ≤ i1 <I2 <... <IM ≤ n. Then F ∈W 1 n +δ (D), δ = n (s (a −1) −a) (s +a) −1. In [1], this theorem has been proved without taking into account the multiplicity and raising of curves at a disposal of f. T.S. Mardvilko 229 Theorem 2. Let dm ⊂ d ′, m = 0.1,2, ..., - limited areas, | d ′ | ≤ r <mm. Let FM: D → DM-the sequence of display with the S-medium characteristic, S> (N-1) −1 and the sequence {FM} converges evenly inside D to the continuous display f, f: d → rn. Then KO, S (F) = (∫ D K S O (X, F) DLX) 1 S ≤ Limm → وges, S (FM). Theorem 3. [2] Let S ≤ 2N --2 and display f: d → D ∗ - there is an extreme display in the class Ki, S (D, D ∗). Then F ∈ W 22 (D ′) for any sizes D 'such that j (x, f)> 0 on the closure D̄ ′ and D̄ ′ ⊂ D. Theorem 4. Let S ≤ 2N-2 and display f: d → D ∗ - there is an extreme display in the class KX, S (D, D ∗). Then F ∈ W 22 (D ′) for any sizes D ′ such that j (x, f)> 0 on the closure D̄ ′ and D̄ ′ ⊂ D. Literature 1. Malyutin A. N., Elizarova M. A.
