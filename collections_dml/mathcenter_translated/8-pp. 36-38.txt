The coefficient conditions of the trigonometric row convergence on average let the appropriate trigonometric series ∑ happen ∑ et = − least cne inx. (1) As usual, we will use the designations: sn (x) = n∑ k = −n cke ikx, σn (x) = 1 n + 1 n∑ k = 0 sk (x) for all n ≥ 0. It is known that if the private sums of SN converge (limited) in the metric L, then 1 2π ∫ 2π 0 | σn (x) - sn (x) | DX = O (1) (respectively, = O (1)). (2) 36 is due if the row (1) is near the Fourier, then the condition (2) follows the convergence (limited) in the metric l of the private sums of the row (1). In the hackers of the species (2), we believe, of course, that N strives for icles. In the report, it is appreciated to discuss the abilities associated with the next four theraps. Theorem 1. 1) If the condition (2) is fulfilled, then ∑2n k = [n/2] | ck |+ | c -k | | K - N |+ 1 = O (1) (respectively, = O (1)); (3) 2) If for some ε ∈ (0, 1) and the whole number m 6 = 0 the condition ln (n+1) max j = 1, ... nε] || cn | - | cn+is completed jm || = O (1) (respectively, = O (1)), then from the condition (2), and even more so, from the condition (3) the condition (| cn | cn |) ln n = o (1 ) (respectively, = O (1)). (4) It turns out that for some common rows of species (1) the theorem 1 can be used to be used to the sequence of nature number {nn} inous = 1 will say that it is like FL, if it is also, for a certain nature of P, it satisfies the condition of the Inf. {Nn+p/nn: n ≥ 1}> 1. The sequence of actual numbers {an} mmn = 1 is a sequence of the type K1 if there are such FL sequence {nn} mmn = 1 and the number a ≥ 1, which Each inhibitory k finds the urgent functions wor (n), ψk (n) and the sign SK = ± 1, for which AN = SK accord (N) ψK (N) of all n = nk -1 + 1,. . . , Nk, ∗ (n) does not decrease, ψk (n) does not renounce either wor (nk) ≤ auction (nk -1 + 1), or ψk (nk - 1 + 1) ≤ aψk (nk). Squeezed {an} mmn = 1 We call a sequence of type K2 if there are such FL -sequence {nn} inous = 1, the fire sequence of the actual numbers {θk} φk = 1 37 and the whole m ≥ 0, which is for each nature of There is a polynomial PK degree not higher than m, for which an = pk (n) nθk is all n = nk -1 + 1,. . . , Nk. If, there are such positive numbers Δ and ε that NK - NK -1 ≥ δnεk, we will say that {an} mmn = 1 of the type K3, exist. Theorem 2. If each of the sequences {re cn} φN = 1, {IM cn} ger = 1, {re c --n} mmn = 1, {Im c --n} מ = 1 (5) type K1 or K2, then for a series (1) the conditions (2) and (3) are equivalent. Moreover, if each of the sequences (5) type K3, then conditions (2), (3) and (4) are equivalent. A special case of theory 2 for the rows of Fourier, when the coefficients of quasimonotonna, was obtained by S. A. Telyakovsky and G. A. Fomin (1975), and the case when m = 0, all θk = 0 and sequence {nn} mmn = 1 Lacunapna, was received by S. A. Taljakovsky (1991). Note that we will have a condition (2) for the pro -Russian trigonometric rows, and not only for the rows of Fourier. Theorem 3. Let {β (n)} و = 1 - a sequence of positive numbers that is proceeding to least. Then you can post such a series of Fourier species (1) with unlimited metric l by private amounts that | CN - CN+ 1 |+ | C - N - C - N - 1 | ≤ ln (n + 1) β (n)/n for all n ≥ 1 and a perpetual condition (4) is fulfilled. Theorem 3 shows that the next theorem 4. If a certain natural m is the condition | CN - cn+ m |+ | C - N - C - N - M | = O (ln (n + 1)/n), then for a series (1) conditions (2), (3) and (4) are equivalent. 38
