One asymptotically optimal method of solving ordinary integro-radio equations we consider the general linear regional problem Ra (x) = 0, ν = 0, p-1, (1) for the integro-radio equation KX = X (p) + p∑ k = 1 gk (t) x (p --k) + + m∑ j = 0 1∫ −1 hj (t, s) x (j) (s) ds = y (t) - 1 ≤ t ≤ 1, (2) where Raν, ν = 0, p - 1, is the data of linearly independent functionality in space (P -1) times continuously differentiated functions, GK (t) ∈ L2 [−1, 1] (K = 1, P) , hj (t, s) ∈ L2 [−1, 1] (j = 0, m); P IM - whole non -negative numbers that satisfy the condition p> m. The subspace of approximate solutions XN Tasks (1), (2) will be asked as follows: XN = LIN {EI (t): I = 1, N}, 27 where EI (t) is algebraic versions of the degree n+p - 1, satisfying the condition (1) (in more generally, an arbitrary N-dimensional subspace of functions from L2 [−1, 1] that satisfy the condition (1)) can be taken as a subspace of XN. Put yi (t) = t∫ −1 dt. . . t∫ −1︸ ︷︷ p ei (t) dt.
