Some tasks for the Emden-Fauler equation and short O.I. Samara State University by Emden-Fauler's equation (UEF) by. A new different different different equation of the 2nd order in "+ ~ y '+ bxm-Lyn = O. x it has a number of physical applications, for example, is used in nia physics, for example In astrophysics, etc., from a mathematical point of view, it is also interesting - it is a non -linear equation with the resolution of the Yami, the behavior of which can be determined with amazing accuracy, despite the fact that they, generally speaking, cannot be obtained in an explicit form [1]. The question of the exact decisions of the UEF, its group properties, as well as the leading to the autonomous form, was investigated in [2]. In this work, the following tasks are considered with the regional and on cuper conditions. 1 °.

Using the Runge-Kutt method and the final method implemented in the Thrbo Pascal 5.0, as well as the Mathematica package, it was possible to get a solution to these problems.
