The conditions of the existence of a function, an orthogonal set system Exhibent discusses the conditions for the sequence of complex numbers λk, k = 1, 2, ..., when performing which 18 for the function f ∈ L2 (R) are true equality +و −mber eλkt –T 2 f (t) dt = 0, k = 1, 2, ..., (1) it follows that f = 0 in l2 (r). For the sequence of complex numbers λk, | λk | 6 | λk+1 |, k = 1, 2, ..., upper density ∆ = limk → و K | λk | 2; Counting function N (t) is the number of members of the sequence λk, k = 1, 2, ..., in the circle | λ | 6 t. Theorem 1. Let λk, k = 1, 2, ..., - - an increasing sequence of complex numbers. Then 1. If a row φ∑ k = 1 1 | λk | 2 (2) converges, then there is a non -level function F ∈ L2 (R), for which equality is true (1); 2. If a row (2) diverges and at the same time the upper density ∆ = 0, then there is a non -legal function F ∈ L2 (R), for which equality is true (1). Theorem 2. Let λk, k = 1, 2, ... - - an increasing sequence of complex numbers. Then 1. If limr → °   1 r2 r∫ 0 n (t) t dt  > 1 8 and correct (1), then f ≡ 0 in l2 (r); 2. If the upper density is ∆> e/4 and correct (1), then f ≡ 0 in l2 (r). 19 similar results are obtained if instead of integrals (1) to consider integrals of the type +nder∫ − least eλkt - | t | α f (t) dt = 0, k = 1, 2, ..., α> 1.
