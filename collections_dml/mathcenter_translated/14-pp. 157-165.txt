One homeomorphism between the classes of single -leaf functions in the future <δ is the class of regular and single -leafy in the ring Δ2 <| z | <1 functions, each of which performs a conformal display of this ring to a particular double area, symmetrical regarding the circumference | W | = Δ, and moreover, so that the circle | z | = δ is displayed into the circle | W | = δ with the preservation of orientation, and the point Z = Δ passes to point 163 W = Δ. Let S - a class of regular and single -leafed in a circle | z | <1 functions F (Z) normalized by conditions F (0) = 0, F ′ (0) = 1. Finally, if γ is some limited closed subset W-thoroughness, then it should be understood as the class of measorphic and γ (γ) one -leafy in addition to many γ functions that do not accept values ​​equal to zero, and in the vicinity of an infinitely removed point, decomposition I (w) = w + a0 + a1 w + a2 w2 +. . . where the multi -flowers indicate members containing higher degrees of 1/w. The next theorem is known in the literature called the Torization Theorems. Theorem 1. Let the function w = w (z) ∈ <Δ conformally displays the ring Δ2 <| z | <1 to the double region D, the internal component of the addition to which to the entire plane coincides with the continuum γ. In these assumptions, there is, moreover, the only function of the IW (W) from the class σ∅ (γ), such that the composition LW (Z) = IW ° W (Z), determined in the ring R <| z | <R, analytically continues in the full circle | z | <1, LW (0) = 0, and is in this circle a regular and single -leaf function. For the first time, the theorem on factorization and, moreover, in a more general form was established by V.D. Erokhin [1], [2]. The theorem on factorization arose from the needs of the theory of approximation. Later, ideas expressed by V.D. Erokhin, received development in the works of other authors (see [3] - [5]). Suppose that the function vτ (z) ∈ <δ continuously depends on the small material parameter τ, 0 <τ <τ ∗, and with τ → 0+ evenly inside the ring Δ2 <| z | <1 strives for some function w (z) ∈ <δ. Let the function w = w (z) conformally display the ring R <| z | <R on the two -way area D, the addition to which to the entire plane consists of a limited continuum γ and an unlimited continuum B. We denote the conformal image of the ring Δ2 <| z | through DV. <1 when displayed v = vτ (z). Obviously, DV is a double -ivated area, one of the two connected components of the addition of which is limited to the entire plane γV, and the other BV is unlimited. In accordance with the theorem of factorization for the function vτ (z) at any τ, 0 <τ <τ ∗, there is the only function IV (V) from class σ∅ (γV), for which the composition LV (v) = IV ° vτ ( z), determined in the ring Δ2 <| z | <1, analytically continues in the full circle | Z | <1 and is in this circle a regular and single -leaf function. Since with τ → 0+ function vτ (z) 164 evenly inside the ring Δ2 <| z | <1 strives for the W (Z) function, it is natural to expect that the functions of IV (W) and LV (Z) at τ → 0+ uniformly inside their areas of the definition converge, respectively, to the functions IW (W) and LW (Z) that meets the functions W (Z) in the sense of the theorem 1. Lemma 1. On any closed subset of additions to the continuum γ, an uniform assessment of IV (W) = IW (W) + O (1), τ → 0 + is performed. (1), <1 We have an uniform rating LV (Z) = LW (Z) + O (1), τ → 0 +. (2) proof. Any closed set of F, lying in addition to the γ continuum, can be separated from this continuum of some closed hidden curve Zhordan γ. In turn, and the γ curve can be separated from the continuum γ closed gordanus curve γ ∗. Let ε denoting the distance between the curves γ and γ ∗. With sufficiently small τ, 0 <τ <τ ∗, and any w ∈ γ ∗ point V = vτ (z (w)), where z (w) is a function reverse for W (z), will lie inside (ε/ 3) -On Open Curve γ ∗. When the point w promises the curve γ ∗, point V describes some curve β ∗ closed by Zhordanov. At 0 <τ <τ ∗, the curve β ∗ is entirely located in (ε/3) the surroundings of the curve γ ∗, and, therefore, inside the curve γ. Consider the closure (ε/3) -Ocrests of the curve γ ∗. The addition to this closed surroundings of the curve γ ∗ consists of no more than the counting number of single -link areas. Let Uε - that of them that contains an infinitely remote point. The complement to the area of ​​Uε is a limited single -copied set ∆ε, independent of τ. At 0 <τ <τ ∗ Continum γV, as well as curves γ ∗ and β ∗ belong to the set ∆ε. As for the curve γ, it lies in the Uε, covering the continuum ∆ and remaining from it at a distance of no less (2/3) ε. If necessary, reduce τ ∗ so that with 0 <τ <τ ∗ and any W ∈ γ point V = vτ (z (w)) lay inside (ε/3) -ocrestes of point W. Therefore, at 0 <τ <τ ∗ and w ∈ γ between the point V = vτ (z (w)) and the continuum ∆ε are a certain positive distance, no less ε/3. Since with 0 <τ <τ ∗ function IV (V) it belongs to the class σ∅ (∆εε), on the curve γ a uniform assessment IV (W) = IV (V) + O (1), τ → 0+, ( 3) 165 and, therefore, with w ∈ γ and τ
