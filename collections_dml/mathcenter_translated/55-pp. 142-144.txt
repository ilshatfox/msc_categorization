Materials of the Youth School-Conference UDC 512.55 A group of autorphisms of the rings of formal matrices D.T. Tapkin1 1 danil.tapkin@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University dismantled the problem of isomorphism for the rings of the upper formal matrices and rings of formal matrices with zero trace ideals. A clear type of isomorphism has been obtained. For a special class of rings of formal matrices, it is shown that all R-automorphisms are internal. Keywords: rings of formal matrices, zero ideals of the trace, isomorphism, autorphism, internal automorphism. In the last decade, the study of the rings of formal matrices has become widespread (see [1-4], [6-8], [13], [14]). Many of the results obtained recently were reflected in the monograph [5]. For the first time, the issue of isomorphism of the rings of the upper formal formal matrices was studied in [12]. Later in [9], this result was enhanced, and an explicit type of isomorphism was obtained for the rings of the upper formal formal matrices of the order 2. In [10] a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of isomorphism between the two rings of the upper formal -shaped protection is obtained. And finally, in [11], a clear type of isomorphism was obtained for the rings of formal second -order matrices with zero trace ideals. When studying the problem of isomorphism, it was possible to get an explicit type of isomorphism for the next classes of rings of formal matrices of order N: the rings of the upper formal matrices and the rings of formal matrices with zero trace ideals. With certain restrictions on the diagonal rings, in both cases, isomorphism is elemental, accurate to rearrangement and conjugation. Getted by the following factory. Let. Let. Let - the community ring. Throughq (r) we will denote the full ring of private S -11R, where s are many indigenous indigenous ring R. Theorem 1. Let it be a comprehensive ring without non -trivial myempotents, n ∈N and {II J} 1≤i <J≤n - set The ideals of the Ring R Ring Ring, each of which contains at least one element of a zero, while demanding that II J I J K ⊆ II K be performed for each three I <j <k. Let A = TN ((R); {II J}) ⊆ TN (Q (R)) - a ring of formal matrices with natural operations of matrix addition and multiplication. Then all R-automorphisms of the ring A are presented in the form of the composition Cu °CV, where u ∈U (A), V = Diag (h1, ..., hn) ∈U (tn (q)), cv (a ) = A.. There are examples showing that in general, it is not possible to get rid of CV automorphism. However, the following result is true. Theorem 2. Let, in the condition of theorem 1, the whole closing of the ring r in Q (R) coincides with R and ideals II J of course generated. Then all R-automorphisms of the ring A are internal. D.T. Tapkin 143 well -known examples of integrated rings are the dedecindovs of the ring and factorual rings. Moreover, by virtue of the non -dedecindic rings, all their ideals are certainly generated. Investigation 1. Let R - Dedecindovo Ring, N ∈ N and {II J | 1 ≤ I <j ≤ n} - a set of non -equal ideals of Ring R Rings, such as II J I J K ⊆ II K for every crop I <J <k. Let A = TN ((R); {II J}) ⊆ TN (Q (R)) - a ring of formal matrices with natural operations of matrix addition and multiplication. Then all R-automorphisms of the ring A are internal. Theorem 3. Let R - Factorial Ring, N ∈N and {II J | 1 ≤ I <j ≤ n} - a set of non -equal ideals of the Ring R Rings, such as II J I J K ⊆ II K for every trait I <j <k. Let A = TN ((R); {II J}) ⊆ TN (Q (R)) - a ring of formal matrices with natural operations of matrix addition and multiplication. Then all R-automorphisms of the ring A are internal. Literature 1.
