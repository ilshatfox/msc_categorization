Here A (t), b (t) - actual functions, continuous everywhere, except for the gap points of the first kind tj, j = 1, φ, j = −1, –ura, converging to infinity, and the indicator of the convergence of these sequences does not exceed a unit, δk (0 ≤ Δk <2) - the size of the jump at the point tk for the selected branch of the function ν (t) = arg {a (t) - ib (t)}, С (t) =                               ν (t) + −k∑ j = −1 δj, t ∈ (t --k - 1, t -k), ν (t), t ∈ (t - 1, t1 ), ν (t) - k∑ j = 1 δj, t ∈ (tk, tk+1), and С ϕ (t) = {ν --tρ+ν̃ (t), t> 0, ν+| t | t | t | ρ + ν̃ (t), t <0, (1) where ν -, ν +, ρ is constant, 0 <ρ <1, ν - 2 + ν + 2 6 = 0, ν̃ (t) - a function that satisfies Hölder condition with an indicator µ, 0 <µ ≤ 1, on the entire circuit l, including an infinitely removed point. By the method of the regulatory factor with the involvement of the device of the theory of entire functions, a general solution to this problem was obtained in the classroom of analytical in the upper half -fruitlessness of the functions that allow the counting set of summarized features at the border. The captain of the resolution depends on the right part of the formula (1) and is determined by many entire functions of the 199 order not Above ρ, satisfying the condition of symmetry and some additional restrictions on the material axis.
