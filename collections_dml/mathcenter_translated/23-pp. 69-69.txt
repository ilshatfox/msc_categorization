-Cectors of linear orders let LN-the class of all n-nizic (i.e., such a ∈ ∆02, which a (n) ≤t ∅ (n)), HN is the class of all N-high (i.e., such a ∈ ∆02, that ∅ (n+1) ≤t a (n)), turing degrees. The degree of Deg (l) of the estimated linear order l = 〈ω, <l〉 is called the turing degree of such a predicate r (x, y), which x <l y) is called and only when R (x, y). We introduce the following classes of linear degrees: spectrum spec (l) = {deg (l ′) | L ′ ∼ = l} and ∆02-spectrum spec ∆02 (l) = spec (l) ∩∆02. Theorem 1. For any N, there is such a linear order LN that Specech 0 2 (LN) = ∆ 0 2 - LN. Theorem 2. For any N, there is such a linear order LN that Specech 0 2 (LN) = HN. 71
