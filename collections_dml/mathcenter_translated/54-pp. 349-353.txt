One inequality of Ulyanov i.e. Tileubaev1 1 tileubaev@mail.ru; Eurasian National University named after L.N. Gumilyov in the article obtained inequalities like P.L. Ulyanova. The issue of the ratios between the best approaches of functions F in various metrics is also being studied. Keywords: Ulyanov’s inequalities, the best approach, smoothness module. Let 1 ≤ P ≤ear, α> −12. Through LP, α, we denote the space consisting of measurable functions f (x) on [0, φ) for which the norm is finite ∥∥ f ∥∥p, α = (ˆ φ 0 | f | p x2α+1d x) 1 p, 1 ≤ p <inous. We denote through lip, α the set of all functions F (x), which are uniformly continuous and limited to [0, urb). The norm in the space is determined as follows: ∥∥ f ∥∥و, α = sup xuss [0, و) | F |, p = inous. Let us consider in the space of LP, α the operator of a generalized shift [1] function f (x): t h f (x) = γ (α+1) γ (12) γ (α+1 2) ˆ π 0 f (√ x2+h2 −2xh cos accord) (sin pul) 2αd accord. We note some properties of the operator T H: LP, α → LP, α: T H Jα (λx) = Jα (λx) Jα (λH), Jα (U) = 2αγ (α+1) Uα Jα (U), where Jα (u) - the function of the plot of the first kind of order α, ∥∥∥t h (f) ∥∥∥ p, α ≤c ∥∥ f ∥∥p, α, 1 ≤ p ≤ently, ˆ φ 0 t h f (x) G (x) x2α+1D x = ˆ mm 0 f (x) t h g (x) x2α+1d x. For the function f ∈ LP, α the final differences ∆KH f (x) order K (k = 1.2, ...) with step h> 0 determine as follows: ∆1h f (x) = f (x) –T H (x), ∆KH F (x) = ∆ 1 H (∆ K -1 h f (x)), k> 1. The size ωk (f, δ) p, α = sup0 <h≤pers ∥∥∥∆ K h f ∥∥∥ p, α will be called a generalized smoothness module of the function of the function F ∈ LP, α. Denote through m (ν, p, α), ν> 0 set of all functions qν (t), t ∈ R, satisfying the following conditions: 1) qν (t) - an even function of the exponential type ν, 2) qν (t ) belongs to the LP class, α. 350 Materials of the International School-Conference The best approach of the function f ∈ LP, α from class m (ν, p, α) we determine as follows E All (F) P, α = Inf {∥∥ f –Qν∥∥p, α: qν ∈ M (ν, p, α)}. Lemma. Let 1 <p <q <mm, τ = 2 (α+1) then is true inequality (ˆ mm 0 (m∑ S = 1 | qn2S (x) −qn2S -1 (x) | q x2α+1D x) 1 q ≤c {m∑ s = 1 ((n2s) τ (1p - 1q) en2s -1 (f) p, α) q} 1q. Proof.
