Displays with the S -Summable characteristic consider f: d → rn, where d ∈ Rn. Denote through K0 (x, f), ki (x, f) external and internal dilatation of display f. Definition. Display F is called the display with K ∗ I, S -Summified characteristic S> 0, if 1) display F continuous, isolated, class w 1N, LOC (D), and Jacobian J (x, f) 0 almost everywhere in D; 2) there is a constant k ∗ i, s> 0, such that k ∗ i, s (f) =   ∫ d (ki (x, f) j (x, f)) s · (1 + | x | 2) −ndx   1/s ≤ k ∗ i, s. Let γ - the family of curves in D. Determination. Non -progressive Borelev function ρ call the permissible metric for the family γ, if ∫ γ ρ (x) n (γ, x, i) dord (x) 1 + | x | 2 ≥ 1 for each for each curve γ ∈ γ. 163 This definition differs from a similar definition in [1], [2] by the presence of a multiplier integral (1 + | x | 2) −1. Definition. For an arbitrary p, 0 <p <φ, we determine the spherical module of the order of the family γ as the size mp = Inf ∫ rn ρpdσx, dσx = dx (1 + | x | 2) n, where the Inf is taken in the class of permissible for the family of γ metrics ρ. Theorem 1. Suppose that f: d → rn is the display with k ∗ i, s - sosmimized characteristic, where s> n/(n - 1). Let A - Borelevsky set in D such that the multiplicity of n (f, a) <mm. If γ is the family of curves in A, then MS -1 (γ) ≤ c (n, a) k ∗ i, sns (f, a) msns n -1 (fγ). Theorem 2. Let γ - the family of curves in d, f - the display with k ∗ i, s - limited distortion, s> n - 1, and any curve γ ∗ ∈ Fγ has at least M, substantially different partial uplifts belonging to γ. Let Hi ∈ W 1N, LOC (Bn (Y, R)), where F ° Hi = ID. Then MS (Fex) ≤ C (N, D) 1 ms MS - N+1ns S - N+1 (γ) K ∗ i, s (n - 1). 164 l and tr u r a 1. Vaisala J.
