-Lanium system in full differentials using the method of constructing the first integrals of multi-differential system according to its private integrates [1], as well as the method of constructing the first integrals of the linear system [2], we find the first integrals! R. linear system in complete differentials DW = A 1 (w) dz + a2 (w) dz, w e joint venture, z e cm, t <n, (1) when elements of matrices a1 (w) = jja; j (w) ll and a2 (w) = llai, M+j (w) 11 p are! R. Line functions a, k: w ~ 2: (Aik {w {+aik, n {w {) {= =! Vw e, a; k/ e with this, the differential system (1) is quite resolved in the expanded space: bkb <= b <bk, k = 1, 2m, (= 1, 2m, where bj = llb; 1 , b;, m+jll and bm+j = llbi, m+i> biill - square matrices, whose vector -divers are b; k = color (a; ki,. .., a; k, 2n) and 2n) and 2n) and 2n) b; k = color (a; k, n+1, ..., a; k, 2n, aikl, ..., aikn), i = r; n, k = 1, 2m, j = 1, m . Building autonomous! R-differentiated first integration of a completely permitted system (1) is based on the following pattern. Let the V e C2 theorem "-the general own vector of matrices AK, k = 1.2. Then IR-linear on C" function P: function P: W ~ n l (v { + vp + {w {) vw e is a private integral.m {= 1 system (1). Based on their own numbers of matrices AK taking into account the brief of elementary divisors and the common own their own own Vectors are built by the basis of the autonomous first in tags in a complex phase space.
