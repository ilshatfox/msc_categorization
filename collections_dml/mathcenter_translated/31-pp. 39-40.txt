Localization of the features of the gradient of solving the first problem of the Darbu for the equation with the Gellestedt operator in the main part of M. A. Gerbecov NII PMA KBNC RAS, Nalchik, niipma@mail333.com Consider the equation (–Y) muxx - uyy + a (–Yy) n n. −2UX = f (x, y) (1) in the area D of the Euclidean plane of points (x, y) limited by its characteristics AC: x = (−y) n/n and bc: l - x = (−y) n /n and segment AB: 0 ≤ x ≤ l the axis of the abscissa. It is assumed that n = 1 + m/2, m ≥ 2, | a | ≤ m/2, f (x, y) - a given actual function from space C (d̄), where d̄ is the closure of the region D. The first task is Darbu. To make a solution u (x, y) equations (1), continuous in d̄ and d̄ and satisfying the conditions u (x, 0) = 0, u | ac = 0. (2) in the works [1], [2] for the Gellestedt equation, the conditions were obtained under which the effect of localizing the features of the gradient of the first task of the darbu and the criterion is established and the criterion is established its continuity. The work of [3] studies the behavior of the gradient solving the second problem of Darbu for the Gellestedt equation. Theorem. Let F ∈ C1 (D̄) and F (0, 0) 6 = 0, 2 <m <4. Then the first component of the gradient 5U = (ux, uy) solution u (x, y) Darbu (2) tasks for the equation (2) 1) It is continuous everywhere in d̄, with the exception of point (0, 0), where it turns into infinity, and the second is continuous in d̄. 39 L and T R A T R A 1.

The calculation of the concentrations of aerosol particles during the flow of the cylinder and the sphere of A.K. Gilfanov Kazan State University Solving the problems of obstacles of various forms of the aerosol stream is mainly reduced to calculating the seizure coefficient of particles settling on the obstacle. At the same time, the presence of the streamlined body in the flow of aerosol particles also leads to a change in their concentrations in the surroundings and on the surface of the body. Knowledge of the distribution of particles concentration expands the understanding of the process of the agricultural surveillance. In the work, the fields of concentrations of aerosol particles are calculated at the flow of the cylinder and the sphere, taking into account the influence of strength 40
