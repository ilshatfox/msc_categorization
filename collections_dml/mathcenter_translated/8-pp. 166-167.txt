One singular integro -differential equation 166, let L - a smooth closed contour that does not contain an infinitely reduced point. Let the functions A (ψ), b (ψ), f (ψ) ∈ C (M) λ (l) are set on it. a 2 (ψ)-B2 (ψ) 6 = 0 everywhere on L. Consider on L the singular integro-differential equation k accord (ψ) onic (t) + b (ψ) (s (t) –hm (sψ; t)) = f (ψ), (1) where S is the Singular integration operator along L, HM (F; T) - interpolation polynomial of the Erma of the function F, built according to the nodes T1, ..., TN under the following conditions H (l ) m (f; ti) = f (l) (ti), i = 0, ..., n; l = 0, ..., αi - 1, m = α0 + α1 + ... + αn - 1, ti 6 = ti 6 = j. Private cases of the integral equation (1) were considering in the works [1], [2]. The appropriate solution of equation (1) is obtained by a known method in the form ffic (t) = rf + κ + m∑ k = 1 ck accord (t). (2) the permanent CJ in the solution (2) are subordinated to the conditions κ+m∑ k = 1 ckω (l) k (ti) = - 1 2 (qf) (qf) (ti), i = 0, n; l = 0, αi - 1. (3) the rank of system (3) and the number of permissibility conditions significantly depend on the values ​​of the coefficient A (t) and its derivatives at points T0, ..., TN. The results of the study of equation (1) are used by us to build solutions of the equation k0 accord with the “polar” features in the final number of the points of the contour L. L. L. Torin A.
