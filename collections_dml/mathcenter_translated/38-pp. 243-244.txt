The fullness of the root functions of one class of the beams of differential operators 243 in the space L2 [0, 1] Consider a bunch of ordinary differential operators L (>.), Generated by Diffh with a renebal expression e (y,) ..): = l pska8 y (k) 'pskk E <s, rap i o, s+k = n and the edge conditions and; (y, .. \): = l a8 aisky (k) (o) = o; I = 1.1, s+ k = x..o andi (y,>.): = l a8 aisky (k)+ s+ k ~ x, o+ l) .. 5 f3isky (k) (1) = o, i = l + 1, p, s + k: ;;;; u; i where) .. e s, ah :: /zisk e <s, hu, x; 1 e {o, 1 , ..., p - 1}, p - l ~ l <p. Let the roots {Ш1} R characteristic equation l pskshk = o are different, different from zero and lie on one s+k = n the beam emanating from the beginning coordinates. Without violating the community, we can consider the <Ш2 <· · · · · <w. (]) The task of: finding the conditions for the parameters of the Puch Ka L () ..), in which there is a M-time 244 in . Zh. Rykhlov (1 ~ m ~ p) the fullness of the root functions of this PUCH in space L2 [0, 1]. For the LUMCE L (.L) under consideration, with condition (1), the main assumption is not fulfilled [1], namely that there is a direct D, passing through the beginning that does not contain a W -root and dividing the complex plane into two half -fruits, inside each of which the number of these roots is not less than P - l. To formulate the main result, the introduction of the designation: I = l + l, n, i = l, n, bij = l f3iskwj, i = l + 1, p, j = 1, n; s + k = xn xi = min, xi1}, i = l + 1, p; ( p] + = {p, o, n ~ o, p <o. Theorem. If the condition (1) and the distinguished is the condition from zero.
