The basis for the study of many holomorphic and local single -leafy in the circle E = {ζ ∈ C: | ζ | <1} Functions F with the only extremum of the functionality ρf (ζ) = (1- | ζ | 2) | f ′ (ζ) |, (1) called the internal conformal radius of the region F (E) relative to point F (ζ) [1 ] (C. This note establishes a number of properties of the set simulating A with normalized (F ′ (0) = 1) immersion F 7 → F = F ′ ′/F ′ in the space of the flea b - banakh space of the holomorphic in E functions with the norm ‖f‖b = | F (0) | + | F | B, where | F | b = supζ∈E ρf (ζ) < + inous. As the starting point, the theorem 1. The radius R maximum closed foreright BR (0) = {f ∈ B: | b 6 r}, which is entirely contained in the multitude A (identified with its own way when immersed), is 2. The set of A It is absorbing, but will not be balanced (even in case F (0) = 0), nor star -shaped. However, when limited to subspace b̃ = {f ∈ B: f (0) = 0}, the variety of ã = a ∩ b̃ acquires star -shaped: theorem 2. If f ∈ ã and 0 6 T 6 1, then tf ∈ ã. This allows you to give a description of the insides of Intb̃.1, the closure of CLB̃P and the column of the FRB̃P of the set of the functionality of Minkovsky M for ã, which determines the functionality b̃ (f) = SUP {b> 0: Bf ∈ (F) = 1/m (f) for f ∈ S̃1 = {f ∈ B̃: | f | b = 1}. Standard approximation of the set of the set M ([4]. P. 147) leads to the following conclusion: Theorem 3. The ratio of integers interacts = {bf: f ∈ S̃1, b <b̃ (f) ⊂ ⊂ ⊂ clb̃ander = {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{ BF: F ∈ S̃1, B 6 B̃ (F)}, (2) 135 FRB̃AN = {B̃ (F) F: F ERRO S̃1}; (3) Functionality B̃ continuously on S̃1 and 2 6 b̃ (F) 6 2/| F ′ (0) |, F ∈ S̃1, (4) Moreover, the simultaneous execution of both inequalities in (4) distinguishes the subset of the sphere S̃1, parameterizing (F 7 → 2F) intersection (FRB̃P) ∩B2 (0). The set of ã (means, and a) will not be limited, as the example of the sequence fn (ζ) = (1– ω2n) ζ/(1– ωnζ) ∈ S̃1 with ωn ↑ 1, for which fn → 0 is evenly inside E, but FN 9 0 according to normal b and b̃ (fn) = (1 + √ 1 - ω2n)/(1– ω2n) → + urb. When switching to A, the picture is complicated; In particular, analogue b (f) = sup {b> 0: β ∈ (0, b] ⇒ k (βf) = 1} Functionality b̃ is no longer enough to describe a = {f ∈ B: k (f) = 1} = 1} where K (F) = KF: = #MF is the number of elements of the set mf = {a ∈ E: ∇ρf (a) = 0}. Nevertheless, it is possible to get an idea for the intersection (FRBA) ∩ B2 (0), Which is parametrined by the “normalized” sphere S = {f ∈ S̃1: F ′ (0) = 1}: (FRBA) ∩B2 (0) = {2ε tip 1– ctor2 - 2ε −2F (ζ - ε tip 1– εages): F ∈ S, | ε | = 1, lection ∈ (−1, 1)} (5) (theorem 5). When replacing B2 (0) by the forerun D2 (0) = {F ∈ D: | D 6 2 2 2 2 } Banakhov’s spaces of a conductor d with the norm ‖f‖d = | f (0) | + | d, where | f | d = {1 π ∫ ′ e | f ′ (ζ) | 2dising duhes} 1/2 < + ∞, only F (ζ) ≡ ζ. 2. Bifurcation of the FB families should be kept on the right part (5). The linear structure B is natural to study (1) for parametric families Bf (ζ), f ∈ B, b ∈ R . As in [5], the research tools are the functionality of the signkf and the γf index, acting from MF ≡ M (F) to {−1, 0, +1} [6], corresponding to Tchyly, according to the formulas kf (a) ≡ kf (a) = ρ2f (a) [4/(1- | a | 2) 4 - | f ′ (a) - (1/2) f (a) 2 | 2 | 2 | ] (6) and γf (a) = - (2πi) −1 ∫ | ζ - a | = r d ln (∂ρf (ζ)/∂ζ). 136 Lemma 1. Let F - a holomorphic and locally single -leaf function in E, which generates the parametric family FB (ζ) = ∫ ζ 0 [F ′ (Z)] BDZ with b ∈ R+. Let, further, for a certain β ∈ R+ many Mfβ contains an isolated element α, which is multiplicity K as zero of the function g (ζ) - g (α), where g (ζ) = ζf (ζ), and let kfβ (α) = 0 with α = 0. Then, in some surroundings of the point (α, β), the formation is b = ∪b]+ mfb × {b} disintegrates into k analytical curves that intersect in (α, β), and the γ: (a, b index: (a, b ) 7 → γfb (a) does not disappear at (a, b) 6 = (α, β). In addition, the number kb = #{mfb∩ (fairly small surroundings α)} equal to each b 6 = β, close to β, or has a leap equal 2. Finally, in the case of K = 1 (α 6 = 6 = 6 = 6 = 6 = 6 = 6 = 6 = 6 = 6 = 0) equality KB = 1 near β is performed when | γfβ (α) | = 1, either “birth” or “annihilation” of one maximum (γ = +1) and one saddle (γ = −1) in β occur when γfβ (α) = 0. If α = 0 (k = 2) , then 0 ∈ MFB for all b ∈ R+, and γfb (0) = sign (β -b), b ∈ R+\ {β}, and kb = 2+γfβ (α) sign (b --β) at B 6 = β, close to β, which in this case is 2/| {f, 0} |, where {f, ζ} is a derivative of a moor of a function f. The above statement, together with its justification, almost literally reproduces the main lemma proven in [5] - an analogue of Lemma 1 for the FR (ζ) = F (Rζ) family. Standard globalization of lemma 1 leads to a number of properties of laying B “in general”, some of which (necessary for further) unites Lemma 2. Placing B for f ∈ B consists of (no more than counting) unification materially an anch
