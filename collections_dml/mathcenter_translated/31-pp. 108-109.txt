Page 109 of Lavsky [1], which allows you to obtain accurate solutions, which are a generalization of some well -known automatic decisions. Consider the classic trans -into the ideal gas. We assume that the flow is stationary, isnerge and isanthropic [2]. The main system of equations characterizing such currents has the form UX = VY, UY = VX. (1) A symmetrical class of solutions of Zaslavsky - Klepikova for the system (1) is known (including well -known auto -modified solutions for the automotive indicator n = 2, 5/4, 4/5). Let the senior coefficient in the view for x x2 (s) = s, where s is the parameter, i.e. we have: x = x0 (s) + SY 2, u = u0 (s) + u2 (s) y 2, v = V1 (s) y + v3 (s) y 3. (2) by substituting (2) in (1), we get a system of ordinary differential equations for coefficients B (2). From this system, one can distinguish a nonlinear core relative to the U′2 and V ′ 3. An example of it is Zaslavsky’s technology [1] the restoration of other coefficients. We consider the coefficient U2 (S). Indeed, the nonlinear core can be reduced to one equation of the 2nd order relative to the U2 (S), the private solution of which is S = BZ, U2 (S) = S2. The exact solution for (2) has the form (for the purpose of exemption from irrationalities we use the replacement Z = T3): x = bt3y2 + (−6c2b + 5c1t3 + 10c3t5)/(10t5), u = b2t6y2 + b (c1t3 - 3c2b) t - t - t - t - t - 2, v = - (2/3) y3b3t9 + (−b2t4c1 - 6tc2b3) y. (2a) here C1, C2, C3, B are constants. Along with the decision of the Zaslavsky (2) there is a class of single parametric solutions associated with N = 3 (includes known auto -modified solutions 108 for the auto modeliness of n = 3, 5/3, 6/5, 3/5). Put x3 (s) = s, where s is the parameter, x = x0 (s) + SY3, u = u1 (s) y + u4 (s) y4, v = v0 (s) + v3 (s) y3 + v6 (s) y6. (3) Similarly, we obtain the exact solution of the type: (s = bz, u4 (s) = s2, in order to release from irrationalities we use the replacement Z = T4): x = - (4/5) c2bt - 5 + (1/2) C1T + C3 + BT4Y3, U = B2T8Y4 + (T3C1B - 8C2B2/T) Y, V = - (2/3) Y6B3T12 + ( - (40/3) T3C2B3 - T7C1B2) Y3 + + + (16/3) C22B 3T- 6 - 4C1C2B2T −2. (3a) here C1, C2, C3, B are constants. From the point of view of the idea of ​​evidence of the fact that these classes include the above -modified solutions, it is necessary to consider them, find a parametric representation for them and make sure that the symmetrical class of Zaslavsky and the class associated with N = 3. This proof was done by the author and gave the following results . For example, for n = 5/3 of auto -modified representatives, a parametric type was obtained: »(z) = c (5z + 4) −4/9 (z - 1) −5/9, u (z) = - (25/9 ) (z + 1) c2 (z - 1) −1/9 (5z + 4) −8/9, v (z) = (125/81) (Z2 - 2Z - 2) C3 (Z - 1) - - 2/3 (5z + 4) −4/3. Hence X = P - 4Y3 + DP5, U = P -8Y4 + 10DPY, V = - (2/3) P -12Y6 + (50/3) DP - 3Y -3 + (25/3) D2P6. 109
