Polynomial approximations of functions in integrated metrics with a familiar weight of 237 Let 27g-periodic non-negative functions r_ (x) and p+ (x), summarized by [-rr, 1g], set the familiarity of p (x) = (p _ (x (x (x (x (x ), p+(x)). Through L 2, P, we denote the set of all 27g-periodic measures almost everywhere of the final functions G (x) from if 1912, p = (1-: g (x) (g, p) (x) dx) 112 < +oo; (g, p) (x): = g+(x) p+(x) - g- (x) p_ (x); g+ (x) = max {g (x), o}, g- (x) = (-g (x))+. 1-: min {p- (x), p+(x) dx> o, then many 27g-periodic measuring almost every of the final functions J (x) with llfil2, p = sup 11: j (x) (g) (g) (g) (g) p) (x) dxl < +oo -oo -oo -ohing the normalized space L2_, P (here the Supremum is taken in all Ge l2, p with lgl2p ~ 1). For F E L2., P, we determine the analogue of the continuity module in the blowing way: W2, P (F, B) = SUP 11-: (F (X + H) - F (X)) (G, P) (x + A ) DXL, 238 and. K.

The value (J.12, P (F 1 O) with each fixed function F e l?., P is a certain continuity module, and the following analogue of the first theorem of Jack Son about polynomial approaches. Theorem.
