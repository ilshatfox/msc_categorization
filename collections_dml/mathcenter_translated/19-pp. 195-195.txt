) Opera of an indecent lattices are used: definitions and designations from work [1]. Studying: the final sheet operating, defined: in [2]. Bu Demo called the opera inexpensively such lattices that cannot be represented in the form of a non -trivial operating composition of other (simpler) gratings. Theorem. Opera is unfinished are the following sieves: 1) all lattices of the type L 1 x L2, where L 1 and L2 - any final summary lattices; 2) all the final simple lattices; 3) all final lattices with relative additions; 4) All final geometric lattices. There are overwhelming modonys: rh -sized lattices. All of them have the form L 1 ••• lMCM, where CM is a chain from T> 1 element, l; (I = 1.. T) - arbitrary modular grilles. Any: the final distribution grill is either opera is indiscriminate, or has the form of LI ... lmcm · literature 1. Tronin p. N. , KONP O. A. Matrix linear operates // Izv. universities.
