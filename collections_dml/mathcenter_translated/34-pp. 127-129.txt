Degenerate resonance in the pendulum systems S. A. Korolev Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, korolev_s_a@mail.ru The pendulum system is considered with 3/2 degrees of his body with nonlinearity in the form of trigonometric polynoma degrees n (1 <n 6 5) and periodic in time non -core indignation    ẋ = y, ẏ = - n n. ∑ k = 1 pk sin kx+ ε (a sin νt+ by), where PK, A, B are parameters, ν - the frequency of indignation, ε is a small parameter (ε> 0). The unperturbed system (ε = 0) is a hamiltonic with the function of Hamilton H (X, Y) = Y2 2 - N∑ K = 1 PK K Cos KX and is a two -dimensional autonomous system on qi lindra. For each phase curve h (x, y) = h, the phase point is moved from a certain period of the house T (h). Definition. The level h (x, y) = h0 is called degenerated if t ′ (h0) = t ′ ′ (h0) =. . . = T (j - 1) (h0) = 0, t (j) (h0) 6 = 0, j> 1, while we say that the degeneration procedure is J. If t ′ (h0) 6 = 0, then the level is called unpertured. 129 proved that in the area of ​​rotational movements, the function T (h) strictly monotonously decreases. There are no degenerate levels in this area. Next, only the area of ​​oscillatory movements is considered. In this area, degenerated levels of different degeneration procedures may exist. Namely, the blowing theorem is fair [1]. Theorem. For 1 <n 6 4, the maximum possible degeneration procedure in the unpeerated system is N. For degrees of polynoma from 2 to 5, PK coefficients are indicated, in which the function t (h) is non -monotonous and has extreme values ​​of the maximum degeneration. In the presence of periodic in time of indignation (ε 6 = 0), degenerate resonances may exist. With each N, it is possible to have n resonant chains corresponding to the unpertured resonances with the same value of the period of the T. The change in the frequency of indignation ν and parameters a, b with the merger of resonant zones and degenerated resonance. The issue of the topological structure of degenerate resonance zones is considered, depending on the parameter B based on the theory of retic analysis of the average systems [2]. A numerical study of Poincare's display was also conducted. The results obtained are mainly consistent with theoretical. In addition, a new type of bifurcation is established associated with the formation of “vortex steam”. The work was carried out with the support of the RFFI, project 06-01-00270.

Let λ now denotes the sequence {λk, mk}, where λk is complex numbers, such as | λk | → +urb with k → ∞, and MK - natural numbers. Through σ (λ) we will denote a vehicle σ (λ ′), where λ ′ is a sequence {λ′J}, which is arbitrarily compiled from members of the sequence λk so that each point λk is found in it exactly MK once. We introduce more the size M (λ) = lim k → φ mk/| λk |. In addition, through θ (λ), we denote the many limiting points of the sequence {λk/| λk |} (excluding the point λk = 0 from it if it exists).
