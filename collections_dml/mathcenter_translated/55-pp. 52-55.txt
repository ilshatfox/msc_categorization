Nuriev  The paper studies the problems of the structure of the hydrodynamic drag force that arises during the periodic motion of a spherical vibration-driven robot in a fluid and the influence of its various components on the process and efficiency of motion. In Particular, The Role of the History Force of Resistance in the Movement Dynamics of the Robot Is Revealed. The Research Is Carried Out in the Framework of Direct Numerical Simulation The Openfoam Software Package. It is shown that too component of the force in the Case of Finite Periods of Motion Contributes to the Total Force Comparable to the Quasistationary Force. ITS Influence Significantly Reduces the Efficiency of the ConsedMotionMechanism for the Case of High-Frequency Oscillations. Keywords: Vibration-Driven Robot, Hydrodynamic Resistance, Viscous Fluid, Self-Propulsion Device, History Force, Added-Mass Force, Quasistationary Force. UDC 517.95 On the stability of solving one non -KENTAL task for a hyperbolic equation with a singular coefficient of N.V. Zaitseva1 1 n.v.zaiceva@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Comathematics and Mechanics named after N.I. Lobachevsky in the work for a hyperbolic equation with a singular coefficient is a non -cabinal task in a rectangular area. The method of spectral analysis has proved theorems of uniqueness, existence and stability of solving the problem. The solution was built in the form of a number of Furye-Bessel, and there is a justification for the convergence of a number in the class of regular decisions. Keywords: non-cabinal task, hyperbolic equation, singular coefficient, a number of fur-bensel, stability. Consider in the rectangular area d = {(x, t) | 0 <x <l, 0 <t <t}, l, t> 0, coordinate plane -xt hyperbolic equation of the species �b u (x, t) ≡ Ut t −UXX - K x ux = 0, N.V. Zaitseva 53 where K ≥ 1 is a given actual number. Formulation of the problem. Find the function u (x, t) that meets the conditions: u (x, t) ∈C 1 (D) ∩c 2 (d), (1) �b u (x, t) ≡ 0, (x, t) ∈ D, (2) u (x, 0) = onic (x), ut (x, 0) = ψ (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ l, (3) l∫ 0 u (x, t) xk d x = A = const, 0 ≤ t ≤ t, (4) where a is a given number, onic (x), ψ (x) - set sufficiently smooth functions that satisfy the approval conditions l∫ 0 onic (x) xk d x = a, l∫ 0 ψ (x) xk d x = 0. (5) The non -valve task (1) - (4) is reduced to the equivalent task (1) - (3) with a local boundary condition ux (l, t) = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ t. (6) by spectral analysis [1, 2] The solution to the problem (1)-(3), (6) is obtained as the sum of a number of Furye-Bessel u (x, t) = φ∑ n = 1 un ( t) xn (x), (7) where un (t) = onic cosλn t + ψn λn sinord t, (8) onic = l∫ 0 onic (x) xk xn (x) d x, ψn = l∫ 0 ψ 0 ψ 0 ψ (x) xk xn (x) d x, xn (x) = 1 || x̃n || l2, ρ (0, l) x̃n (x), x̃n (x) = x 1–k 2 j k - 1 2 ( λn x), n ∈N, || x̃n || 2L2, ρ (0, l) = l∫ 0 ρ (x) x̃ 2n (x) d x, ρ (x) = xk. Here Jν (Z) is the function of Bessel of the first kind of order ν. Operate µN values ​​are defined as zeros equations j k+1 2 (µ) = 0, µ = λl. In [3], the following statements 54 materials of the youth school-conference of theorem 1. If there is a solution to the problem (1)-(3), (6), then it is the only one. Theorem 2. If the functions onic (x) and ψ (x) are satisfied with the conditions onic (x) ∈ 2 [0, l], ψ (x) ∈C 1 [0, l] and ship (0) = ship ′ (0) = ψ ′ (0) = ship (l) = ψ ′ (l) = 0, then there is the only solution u (x, t) of the problem (1) - (3), (6), determined by the side, determined by the side (7), while u (x, t) ∈C 2 (D). Theorem 3. If the functions onic (x) and ψ (x) are satisfied with the conditions onic (x) ∈ C 2 [0, l], ψ (x) ∈C 1 [0, l], ship (0) = ship ′ (0) = ψ ′ (0) = ship (l) = ψ ′ (l) = 0 and conditions (5), then there is the only solution to the problem (1) - (5), determined nearby (7), with this u (x, t) ∈C 2 (D). When substantiating the stability of the constructed solution, a well -known norm is introduced and theorem 4. To solve the problem (1) - (5), the assessment is fair || u || l2, ρ (0, l) ≤c1 (|| onic l2, ρ ( 0, l) +|| ψ || l2, ρ (0, l)), (10) where || F || 2L2, ρ (0, l) = l∫ 0 ρ (x) | f (x) | 2D x, ρ (x) = xk. Proof. Based on the formula (7) taking into account the assessment | un (t) | ≤c2 (| onic |+ | ψn | n), which follows directly from (8), calculate || u || 2l2, ρ (0, l) = l∫ 0 xk u2 (x, t) d x = l∫ 0
