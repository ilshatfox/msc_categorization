Ponnusov3 1 amokira@rambler.ru; Petrozavodsk State University 2 g_ek@inbox.ru; Petrozavodsk State University 3 samy@isichennai.res.in; Indian Statistical Institute, Chenna Center Sets The article presents a criterion for complete α -appropriation for polygarmonic functions. As a result, hence the criterion of complete star -shaped (case α = 0) for polyarmonic functions. Keywords: polygarmonic function, quite α -appropriate function, α -perishable area, star -shaped area. In some sections of mathematics (for example, in the theory of investment, in the theory of integrated representations of the function, in matters of the boundary behavior of the functions, the resolving of the task of the conductor), it is important that the area of ​​determination of the function of the pipe satisfies the condition of the cone, i.e., so that there are universal for ω of the number α ∈ (0; 1) and h ∈ (0; φ] are that for each point p ∈ PiPON, the straight circular cone v (l (p), h) with the top at point P, solution απ, height H, axis of symmetry l (p) lay in ω [1]. We denote through BN [x, r] the closed Euclides ball in RN with the center at point X and radius R. B [2] α -appropriate areas were determined: determination 1. [2] area ⊂ rn, 0 ∈ ω is called α -peril (relatively 0), α ∈ [0; 1), if for each point p ∂ω there is such a number R = R (p)> 0, that cone k+(p , α, r) = {x ∈Bn [p, r]: (x −p, p∥p∥) ≥ ∥x −x −cosαπ 2} ⊂rn \ ω. In [2] it was shown that the α-perical areas are areas with the condition of the cone, while l (p) = −p, and it was proved that the α-appropriate areas are 42 materials of the international school-conference of star-shaped. In the case of α = 0, class 0 -perilative areas in RN coincides with the class of areas, star -shaped relatively 0. For α -perical areas, see also [3]. In the flat case (n = 2), these areas were examined by J. Stankiewicz [4–5], D.A. Brannan and W.E. Kirwan [6]. So, for example, in [4–5] J. Stankiewicz considered the class S1 --α, consisting of (1- α) - star -shaped, α ∈ [0; 1], analytical in a single circle b = {z ∈ C: | z. | <1} Functions of the species f (z) = a1z + a2z2 +. . . , a1 ̸ = 0, satisfying the condition∣∣∣arg z f ′ (z) f (z) ∣∣∣ <(1–α) π 2 ∀z ∈B, and showed that the area ̸ = cα - primizham⇐% = f (b), where F is some function from class S1 --α. In [2] P. Liczberski and V. Starkov, this result was summarized by the billarfic class in the open single Euclidean ball BN, N ≥ 1, functions F: BN - → CN, such as F (0) = 0 and ℜ {Z ∗ (D f (z)) - 1 f (z)} ≥ ∥z ∗ (d f (z)) - 1∥ · ∥ f (z) ∥ · sinαπ 2 ∀z ∈Bn, and proved that all such functions Disputing BN to α -appropriate areas, have the property of heredity (inherit α -appropriation), i.e., if r ∈ (0; 1), then each area F (RBN) α -permitted, α ∈ (0; 1) . It is known that in the class of harmonic functions f: c → c, f (0) = 0, preserving orientation in B, the property of convexity or starship f (b) is not inherited. In such cases, the subclass is distinguished and considered that they have the property of heredity (see [7]). Next, we give a definition of P -Harmonic functions. Determination 2. [8] Function F ∈ C 2P (B), p ∈ N is called P -Harmonic (or Polyarmonic), if ∆P F = 0 B, where ∆ is Laplace operator. It is known that the P -Harmonic preserving orientation in B Function can be presented in the form of φ (z) = p∑ k = 1 | z | 2 (k - 1) fp - k+1 (z), (1) where the functions Fp -k+1 = hp --k+1+g p --k+1, k = 1,. . . , p, are harmonic, HP -K+1 and GP -K+1 - analytical in B. Note that each harmonic function is a P -Harmonic. In this class, P -Harmonic functions consider the subclass of functions inheriting α -permissibility. Determination 3. [9] We will say that the p -harmonic function is φ, φ (0) = 0, jport (z)> 0, is completely tempered, α ∈ [0.1), if for each R ∈ (0 , 1] The function φ displays Br = {z ∈C: | z | <r} to α -appropriate region. Theorem 1. [9] Let the ay -harmonic function of VB (1), φ (0) = 0, and jport (z) 0 vb. Then it is quiteα -appropriate, α ∈ [0.1) ⇐ et for any z ∈B is the inequality of K.F. Amozova, E.G. Ganenkova, S. Ponnusov 43 p∑ k = 1 | z | 2 (k - 1) ℜ {z (h ′ p --k+1φ - g ′ p - k+1φ)} ≥ sin απ 2 · | φ | · L1/2, where l = ℜ2 {z p∑ k = 1 | z | 2k–2 (himate --k+1 - g ′ p --k+1)}+ℑ2 {z p∑ k = 1 | z | 2K−2 (himate --k+1+g ′ p --k+1)}. As a result, from here we get a criterion of complete α -appropriation for biharmonic (p = 2) functions. Investigation 1. Let φ (z) = | z | 2f1 (z) + f2 (z) - bigarmonic function in b, where φ (0) = 0, fk = hk + g k (k = 1.2) - harmonic functions In B. Then φ is quite α-lobed, α ∈ [0.1) ⇐ et for any z ∈B is the inequality | z | 2re {z (h′1φ-g ′ 1φ)} +{z (h′2φ - g ′ 2φ)} ≥ sinαπ 2 · | φ | · L, (2) where l2 = |
