SOME Functionals on the Space of Configurations Associated with the Specifications of Random Fields B.S. Nahapetyan, L.A. Khachatryan  We show that the problem of description of random fields in terms of a subsystem of a specification, consisting only of one-point probability distributions (the Dobrushin problem), reduces to the problem of extension of functionals defined on pairs of configurations that differ only In one point to the Whole Space of Pairs of Configurations. SUCH CONTINATION IS Possible Under Certain Symmetry Conditions of the Functional. Keywords: Specification, Random Field. UDC 514.822 properties of the spherical module of the family of crooked A. Novik1, A.N.

Keywords: spatial module, spatial display, module of the Curve family. The presence of extreme metrics and modules of the families of curves, even on a plane, is often related to difficulties because leading to the solution of the system of differential equations in private derivatives. Therefore, to find extreme metric, there is no universal method. Until now, few spatial tasks are known for which the modules have been found. A significant contribution to the development of the theory of modules was made by V.A. Zorich, I.P. Mityuk, V.M. Milikov, G.D. Suvorov, A.V. Sychev, B. Fyug lane, J. Jenkins, F. Goering, Yu.G. Signac, O. Martio, S. Rickman, Ju. Väisälä et al. Definition 1. Let γ - some family of curves in r̄n. Borelevsky function R: rn → [0; φ] let's call the permissible metric of the family γ, if ´ γ pdlx ≥ 1 for each curve γ ∈ γ, where DLX = DL1+| X | 2. In the future, the recording p ∧γ will mean that P is the permissible metric of the family γ. Determination 2. The spherical module of the family is determined by the formula mα (γ) = Inf ´ rn p αdσx, where dσx = D X (1+ | 2) N and Inf is taken over the class of all kinds of metrics p. Note that the N-dimensional integral in the definition of the module can be narrowed to the smallest Borelevsky set of E, containing the γ family, since INF in 276 materials of the International School-Conference of this definition is achieved on metrics in zolo on c e. Obviously, 0 ≤ m (γ) ≤ear. If the metrics class p ∧γ is empty, then we believe M (γ) = inous. Determination 3. Family γ is exclusive if M (γ) = 0. We will say that some property occurs for almost all the crooked family γ, if the subfamily γ, in which it does not take place, is exceptional. Theorem 1. The family of all kinds of indestructible curves γ in R̄n is exclusively. Proof. Let the γicle be a family of all -highly indestructible curves γ in R̄n. Enter the function P0 (x) = {1 | x | ln | x | , | x | ≥ 2, 1, | x | <2. (1) for it ˆ rn pn0 dlx = 2nωn + ωn - 1 (n −1) lnn -1 2 <mm, ˆ rn pn0 dσx = 2nωn + ωn -1 (n −1) lnn -1 2 < ∞, and in addition, ´ γ p0dlx = 0 for each curve γ ∈ γ. In fact, if the γ curve is limited, then P0 (X) ≥ A> 0 on γ and the statement is obvious. If γ is unlimited, then, choosing a point X on the | x | ≥ 2, we have ˆ γ p0dlx ≥ φ̂ | x | DR R lnr = inous. Thus, the P0 function is permissible metric, and therefore the γicle family is exceptional. The theorem has been proven. Theorem 2. Family γ of all kinds of curves passing through the arbitrary point P of the R̄n space is exclusively. Let F: R̄n → R̄n - transformation of the mebius, i.e., display, represented in the form of a superposition of the final number of the following known elementary transformations: 1) parallel transfer f (x) = x + a, a ∈ Rn; 2) Homotetes f (x) = r x, r> 0; 3) orthogonal transformation f (x) type: f (x) - linear transformation and | f (x) | = | x | for all x ∈ Rn; 4) inversions regarding the sphere S (n - 1) (a, r): f (x) = a + r 2 (x --a) | x --a | 2. Determination 4. If for a certain P0∧γ metrics there is (γ) = ´ rn p α 0 dσx, then the metric p0 is called extreme. We indicate the basic properties of modules. 1. If γ1 ⊂ γ2, then mα (γ1) ≤ mα (γ2). 2. Mα (∪icle = 1γi) ≤ ∑µ ∑ = 1 mα (γi) - the property of semi -adaditivity. Theorem 3. Extreme metric of the γ family is determined in the only way (with accuracy to the values ​​of the multiple of the N-Mortal swing measure zero). Proof. Let the P01 and P02 - two extreme metrics of the family γ. Enter the function p = p01+p022. We prove that p ∧γ is an acceptable measure. For each curve γ ∈ γ we have ´ γ p01dlx ≥ 1 and γ γ p02dlx ≥ 1, then ´ ´ pdlx = 12 γ p01dlx + 12 ´ p02dlx ≥ 1. A. Novik, A.N. Malyutina 277 on the other hand, since the function (a t+bt 2) 1 t, a> 0, b> 0 is an increasing function from t, t> 0, the inequality P01+P022 ≤ (pα01+pα02 2) is performed α, and the equal sign takes place in those and only those points X in which P01 (x) = p02 (x). It follows that ´ rn p αdσx = ´ rn (p01+p02 2) αdσx ≤ 12
