) Many functions close to A-systems will say that the sequence (.f'n) of material measurable functions determined in some probabilistic space (P, µ) is similar to the sequence (F P) E ([0, L0 ))) N, if 'in' in '<lt> o µ (w: \ pn (" -') \> t) = m (t: \ fn (t) \> t), where m is the measure of the label" Determination "Determination" Determination "Definition" Determination 1. Many and with L0 ([0, 1]) we will call .11 -nim type (p, q), if '<t (an) e lp, q and d.l, I' <1 (/p) e) Un has.m sup \ an fn (t) \ <OS almost everywhere. n with p = q = 1 we obtain the definition of a-system [1). Determination 2. Many and with L0 ([0, 1)) we will call an independent type (p, q) if V (A) E LP, Q and for 'I (! P) E 163 un has.

Three theorems are proved that give a complete description of many independent and free types for various P and Q. Conduct: -l: one of them. Theorem. Let with L0 ( [0, 1]), o <q ::; p <oo. The following statements are equivalent: 1) and - many independent type (p, q); 2) U is limited in the space of LP, OO ([O, 1 ]); 3) and - many freedoms ~ -t -type (p, p). Literature 1. Kashin B.
