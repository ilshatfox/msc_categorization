) A one-sided Nil-ideal does not always give rise to the Nil-Ideal of the Ring considered associative rings. We will denote through the mn (r) the ring of all square matrices of the nth order above the ring r, j (r)-the radical of Jacobson Ring R. Amitsur in [1] and the cream in [2] formulated the following equivalent hypotheses. Hypothesis 1. The new-sided Nil-Ideal of the ring will be invested in Nil-ideal (the problem of Keta [3]). Hypothesis 2. If R is a Nil-ring, then mn (r) is Nil-ring for each n. Hypothesis 3. If R is a Nil-ring, then the ring of all polynomials R [x] is quasiregular. Smoktunovich [4] gave a partial negative response to the hypothesis 3: if R is the Nil-ring, then the ring of all polynomials R [x] is Nikolts. Theorem. There is algebra r above the simple field K characteristics 2 with such the right Nil-Ideal J that the ideal M2 (A) of the M2 (R) rings is not Nil-Ideal, where a is the ideal of algebra R, generated by the right-willy-ideal j.

Semenova (Kazan, Alyonasem@yandex.ru) Algebra over the Okada Grafs, Let G (N)-many symmetrical n × n-matrixes, the components of which belong to two-element boulevium algebra {0, 1}. The elements of this set are the matrix of the adjacency of graphs (possibly with loops) without multiple ribs. We also determine the component G (0), consisting of an empty matrix, which corresponds to a column without vertices. By analogy with [1], we determine the operation of the composition G (m) × g (n1) ×. . . G (NM) → G (N1 +.. + NM) is as follows: AB1. . . BM =   A11 + B1 A12. . . A1M A21 A22 + B2. . . A2M ... .... . . ... am1 am2. . . amm + bm  , where aij = aijjninj, jninj is the ni × nj size matrix consisting of units; AII + BI - a matrix obtained from BI adding AII to each BI element. Theorem 1. Regarding the introduced operation of the composition g = {g (n) | n ≥ 1} is an operation with a single element - matrix (0). The GAR of the G is also an EPI-Operation (in the sense of [2]) and is generated (as an EPI Operation) with a graph of two peaks connected by one rib, and an empty graph of two peaks. Theorem 2. The diversity of the algebra over the GLG (G) Opead is rationally equivalent to the variety of algebra with two binary operations of the layer 68
