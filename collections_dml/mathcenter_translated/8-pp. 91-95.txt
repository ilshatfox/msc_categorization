) The most common fractions of the 91-most fraction of the nth order (N-th) is the rational function of the complex alternating zy type Rn (z) = n∑ k = 1 1 z-zk, {zk} ⊂ c. It is easy to see that rn ( Z) - a logarithmic derivative of algebraic polynoma degrees N with zeros {zk} nk = 1, and also that R̄n (Z) is a vector of the stress of a flat electrostatic field created by a system of single charges placed in ZK points. The class of all the most common fractions of the order ≤ n denote srn. We assume that R0 (Z) ≡ 0, and that the class SR0 consists of this single function. Attention to the logarithmic derivative of polynomas was paid in connection with extreme tasks and rational approximations - the works of A. J. Makintayra and W. H. J. J. Fuchs (1940), A. A. Gonchar (1955), E.P. Odinoko (1960 ). The work of E. A. Gorina (1962), E.G. Nikolaev (1965), A. O. Helfond (1966), V. E. Katsnelson (1967) are devoted to special estimates regarding the logarithmic derivatives of polynomas. The most powerful grades of this kind were V. I. Danchenko (1991). 1sis. One property of the poles of the worst fractions. Let D (l, rn) - the distance between the set {zk} Pole of the function rn (z) and the set set L ⊂ C, and DN (L): = Inf {D (L, R): R ∈ SRN, | R ( z) | ≤ 1 ∀z ∈ L}. Theorem 1 ([1]). With all the large enough n, we have inequalities: 1 9 · log log nog n ≤ dn (r) ≤ 2 · log log nog n, 1 4 · log n n ≤ dn (c) ≤ 2 · log nh, where R is the actual The axis, C is any circle of a single radius. Task. Get grades for DN (k) ink = [—A, a] (A> 0), as well as with an arbitrary continuum K. 92 2 °. The most common rational approximations on compacts that do not break the plane. In the work of V.I. and D.Ya. Danchenko [2] discovered a wonderful fact (quite similar to the well -known theorem of Mergelian, but in fact equivalent to her). Theorem 2 ([2]). Any function F (Z), continuous on the compact K ⊂ C with a coherent addition and analytical in its internal points, can be evenly brought on K to K with any accuracy by the most common fractions. Task. In the case of compact K with incoherent addition, describe all functions F ∈ AC (K), each of which with any accuracy evenly approaches the Ks of the smallest fractions. The task of approximation by the most intraities fractions is even more non -linear than the task of approximation by rational functions with free poles. However, many important results of the theory of polynomial approximations have natural analogues in the theory of approximations by the most common fractions. 3sis. Approximations on special compacts. Let K - compact on C, ‖ · ‖: = ‖ · ‖c (k) - uniform norm on k; CA (K) - a family of all functions F (Z) continuous at K and analytical at the internal points K; ω (f, k, δ) - the module of the continuity of the function F on k. for the function f ∈ C (k) we denote through EN (F, K) and ρn (F, K): = Inf {‖R - F‖: R: R ∈ Srn} Her smallest evasions according to the norm ‖ ‖ ‖ (k) from algebraic polynomas and the most common fractions of the degree ≤ n, respectively. Through k (b, d) we denote the class of all not degenerated into one point of continuum K, for each of which there are point b ∈ K and the number d> 0 such that any point z ∈ K can be connected to a some curve l (b, z) ⊂ k lengths ≤ d. Theorem 3 ([3]). If k = [−d, d], or k = {z: | z | ≤ d} (d> 0), then for any function f ∈ Ca (k) we have ρn + 1 (f, k) ≤ c (‖f‖) (ω (f, k, d/n) + ‖ ‖f ‖2 (d/n)) C C (R) = 12 (1 + R) E2R, N ≥ 1. With k ∈ K (B, D), F ∈ CA (K) We put α (F; Z): = ∫ z b f (ζ) dζ, 93 where integration is carried out according to any hidden path L (b, z) ⊂ k, leading from b to z ([2]). It easily follows from the Mergelian theorem that in this case α (f; ·) ∈ Ca (K). Theorem 4 ([3]). If k ∈ K (b, d), f ∈ Ca (k), then c1 (‖f‖d) ρn+1 (f, k) ≤ en (Feα (f; z), k) ≤ c2 (‖f ‖d)ρn+1(f, K),  где C1(r) = e−r/(2 + 2r), C2(r) = er + 2re2r, n = 1, 2, . . .. Let K - an arbitrary continuum on c, ∗ (z) - one -story conformal display of the unlimited coherent component of the addition to k to c̄ to the appearance of the circle d: = {z: | z | <1}, onic (φ) = و, and γR: = {z: | onic (z) | = R}-r-level level for k (1 <r ≤ mm), gr-(single-link) inside of the curve γr. According to the Walsha Theorem, for the analyticity of the function f ∈ Ca (k) in the GR area (1 <r ≤ φ), the fulfillment of the LIM Supn condition → √ En (f, k) ≤ 1/r is sufficient and sufficient. The theorem 5 ([3]) is fair. Let k ∈ K (b, d), function F (z) is determined on the compact k, is continuous at the points of its border ∂k and the middle -nomorph is on its insides. Lim Sup n → → √ ρn (f, k) ≤ 1 r (1 <r ≤ φ) is necessary and enough to ensure that of the GR of the Logarithmic derivative of a certain function F (Z), analytical in GR and no zero on ∂k. 4 °. The most common fractions to the case. With n ≥ 1 and b ∈ with the most rational differential (n-1) of the order, or the worst fraction of the Pad of the Nth Order for the function f (z), unambiguous and analytical in some surroundings of point B, call the fraction of RN (f, b; ·) ∈ SRN, for which f (z) - rn (f, b; z) = o ((z - b) n) with z → b. Theorem 6 ([3]). For each function F (Z), unambiguous and analytical in
