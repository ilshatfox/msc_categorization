P "Ma'pnm = PNMF, where RPM9 is a piece of a number of Fourier in the polynomas of the Lyandra Lyandra of the order by the first variable and the order of the second variable for the GE l2 function ([ - L, 1] 2). Unambiguous resolution of the method is proved and tired is poured. Evaluation of the error of the approximate solution: where ENM ('p*) is the best approximation of the IP* in l 2 a., by the hebraic polynomas of the order of the first variable and order T for the second variable, and the constant L1 is determined from the inequality IL A 11 :::: ; M.
