Mamchuev NII PMA KBNC RAS, Nalchik, niipma@mail333.ru in the region ω = {(x, y): 0 <x <a, 0 <y <y <y <y <y <y <y <y <y <y <y <y <y <y < b}, a, b ≤ φ consider the system of differential equations dα0xu (x, y) + d β 0yu (x, y) = au (x, y) + f (x, y), 0 <α, β <1, (1) where Dex0T is the operator of fractional integroDifferization of the order γ ([1, p. 9]), f (x, y) - specified and u (x, y) - the desired nmer vectors, a is the constant matrix of the size of n × n. Task. Find the solution of u (x, y) of the system (1), satisfying the following regional conditions: lim x → 0 dα --10x u = onic (y), lim y → 0 d β -1 0y u = ψ (x), (2 ) where wor (y), ψ (x) is the specified N-dimensional vector-function.
