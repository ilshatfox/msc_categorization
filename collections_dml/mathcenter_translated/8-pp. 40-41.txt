) The correction theorem for Helder's space considers the classic task of correcting the function from the gelder space to many low measures to increase its smoothness. Of the previous works on this 40 matics, we note [1], in which it is shown that many functions x ∈ C [0, 1] are such that m {t: x (t) = y (t)} = 0 for all functions From the fixed space of Helder, has the second category in C [0, 1]. In [2], an example of a function from Hα (0 <α <1) is given that m {t: x (t) = y (t)} = 0 for each function from Hool with 1 ≥ β> α. Let ω is the first -order continuity module, h (ω) - the corresponding space of the Helder of the functions on [0, 1]. Definition. We will say that the function x ∈ H (ω) is correctable if there is a measurable set of MX positive measures such that lim s → t; s, tgrmx | x (t) - x (s) | ω (| t - s |) = 0. Theorem 1. There is such an infinite closed subspace B of space h (ω), which each is not correct from identical zero is not corrective. The theorem 2. The set of corrective functions in H (ω) is many the first category. The work was supported by the Russian Federation (project 99–01–00355). L and T R A 1. Goffman C.
