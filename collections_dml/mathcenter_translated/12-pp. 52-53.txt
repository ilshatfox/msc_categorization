. Induced centro -project and linear connectedness on the surface of K.V. Polyakova to A.Lv.Ningrad ~ u state university u · arlock@epc. Albertina. RV. The surface of the projective space P "is considered as a M-diversity x", points of L. with the surface .: Tu association of Ruets .: I am the main thing is the same, the service of uNTROPROPETICTIVE RECRESS. The form 60!-. 1 Lapteva found an object of uNTROPECTIVE connectedness, which contains a sensor of linear connectedness. The following cuttings were obtained: 1. The object of centro -project curvature and the sensor of linear curvature are pseudothens. 2. Bortolotti's equipment induces untrotro -projectic ligaments of two types, and linear subsidies are the same. 3. Two types of connectedness coincide with a tog and only tog yes, Cor and shinging the hyperploster of Bortolotti PN-I is motionless. 4. Linear curvature is equal to. 110 and only then, kog da P11 •. 1 is motionless. If: Crivigence is equal to zero, then the uintro -pro -Projective curvature is zero. 5. Direct AB (B E PN-I) is transferred in parallel to the indocial of linear connectedness J1, when the point B is shifted in a straight line AB. 52 6. Paralyle: 1st transfer of a direct AB to the centroprustrative: SvosPR 1-1'0 of the type takes place when the point B is motionless. 7. Among the by.'iya: all the lines passing through the point of A. determined by the surface of the HT, spray: the 11th of which is tolerated absolutely pair: 1lose in the connectedness of the 1st type along the CT. 8. The expression of the steam tensor. The directness of the direct A in the center of projective connectedness does not depend on the type of induced connection.
