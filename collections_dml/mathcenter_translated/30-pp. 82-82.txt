) The boundary properties of conformal display in the report is supposed to discuss the following classical problem. Let the p - · a single -link area on the lumber plane, 1 · ra11u ~ and which contains more than one point. Then, according to the theorem of Riman, the conformal display f of the ha iijj = {z: lzl <1} on P. is empty ~, a - ~ prinnity of the millet linear: measures for d! IJJj. Question: What can be said about F (A) '? The classical theorem of the brothers Rice is affirming; M.A. Lavrentiev was for now: it is dull that in the general case this result is incorrect. 1Z 1973 GOM L. Carlesan was singing1.
