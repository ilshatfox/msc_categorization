The joint spectral radius, let S - the final set of material matrices of order N, many SM consists of matrices - works of length m matrices from S. Put RM = max a ofher a pos ‖ a ‖1/m. Here ‖ · ‖ ‖ is a ring matrix norm. The joint spectral radius of matrices from S is called the number R = Lim M → ger RM. Let AM be a matrix for which ‖ am ‖ = max auss. Theorem. If S contains only positive matrices, then lim m → ∞ (perm) 1/m = rn. L.A. Beklarian (Moscow, Beklar@cemi.rssi.ru) Group of Homeomorphisms of Direct and Circle. Metric invariants and combinatorial "obstacles" the report is devoted to the description of combinatorial "obstacles", the existence of a metric invariant (invariant measure, projectively 44
