Cases of factorization of the equation of the nth order of the nth order are considered cases of factorization of the equation where x = (x 1, ..., Hp.), [I: j = i: IK = O.T IZ +· · +1N:/:/:/:/:/:/:/:/::/:/:/:/:/:/:/:/: .n k: ;; :::::: (01. .. 1) l (0i2 ...-1.n) · Based on this presentation, conditions were recorded, the fulfillment of which ensures the possibility of lowering the equation (1). Here we will talk about the development of these consequences. A new one is introduced. function u? - u + ["'] a (lli3 ... in) and. . - - (001 ".1) L (oo ~ s .. ·,"), O. A.
