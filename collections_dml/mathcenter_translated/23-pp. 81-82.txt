Difficulty methods for restoring functions in QRγ (ω, m) and Brγ (ω) solutions to many problems of mathematical physics belong to the classes of the functions Qrγ (ω, m) and Brγ (ω). In particular, these classes include solutions to elliptical equations, singular integral equations, etc. Determination 1. Let ω = [−1, 1] l, l = 1, 2 ,. . . , then the function is ∗ (x1., XL) belongs to the class QR, γ (ω, m), if the conditions are met max xicle | ∂ | v | onic (x)/∂xv11 · · ∂xvll | ≤ m, 0 ≤ | V | ≤ r, | ∂ | v | onic (x)/∂xv11 · · · ∂xvll | ≤ m/(d (x, γ) v - r - ζ, r <| v | ≤ s, where s = r + γ, ζ = 0, if r + γ is the whole; s = r + [γ] + 1, γ = [γ] + µ, 0 <µ <1, ζ = 1–µ, if r + γ is non -glue, d (x, γ) - the distance from point x to boundaries γ of the region ω. Determination 2. Let ω = [−1, 1] l, l = 1, 2. . ., then the function F (x1,., XL) belongs to the class BR, γ (ω) (R = 1, 2,., 0 ≤ γ <1) If the conditions are max xicle | ∂ | v | wor (x1,., XL)/∂xv11 · · · ∂xvll | ≤ a | v || v || v |, 0 ≤ | v | ≤ r, 83 | ∂ | v | wor (x1,., XL)/∂xv11 · · ∂xvll | ≤ a | V || v || v |/(D (x, γ)) | V | —r -1+γ, r <| v | ≤ least. The report consists of two parts. The first part is devoted to the calculation of Babenko's dianeals δn (qr, γ (ω, m)), Δn (Br, γ (ω)) and Kolmogorov DN (QR, γ (ω, m); x), DN ((Br, γ (Ω))); x), where x = c (ω) or x = lp (ω). Local splashes were built, the errors of which coincide in order with the assessments of the diameters. The second part of the report is devoted to the optimal methods for restoring the classes of functions QR, γ (ω, m) and BR, γ (ω). Separately, cases are being considered when sets P1 = {arithmetic operations, calculation of functions) are taken as sets of simple operations); P2 = {Bitov operations}. O. N.
