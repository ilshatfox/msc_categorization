Summarized by differential geometric spaces in the report examines the movements of differentially geometric spaces from the point of view of the maxi motion movement groups that are allowed by them. The approval is fair: the theorem A. If the generalized Riman space VP = (MP, G, O.) allows the Group G, (R> (N-L-2)/2+5). That tensor torsion of the metric o.jk = -b (jk) is zero and the very space of the VP (x) is necessary to be 307 Rimanovi. PSY:. ~ vn first (r = n (n +!) / 2) or second (R = n (p -1) / 2 + e:, c = o, 1) lacunarity. Maxi, the WAL order of the Group of movement G, in the spaces of the VP (o:; t: o) equal exactly R = (p-L) (P-2) 12+5. B. theorem in order for the generalized f111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111s (MP, G, O) to allow the group of movement G, order R, it is necessary: ​​a) if,. = (p - l) (p -2) 12 + 5, then n1k = y; ok - ykn 1. yk = gkpyp, Ur = dxp /dt. B) if R = P (P-1) 12+2, then 0 = 0. Max, the 14th order of the Group of movement G, in spaces in P (.Q 1 'O) is exactly R = P (P - 1) / 2 + 2, and these spaces are necessary. If the spaces of the VP, the q is not redeemed, then the maximum order of group G is accurate R = (P-L) (P-2) 12+5. Theorem in. If the financial spaces F, 1, Y allow the Group G, order <a r = (n-L) (P-2) 12 +5, then the tensor G) k does the following structure: C} K = b} AK + 8k a; + /In jk + ei d jk, where b; k = bkj, d; k = dkj • ak (x, j, y) = x 1ak (x, y), in jk (x, i..y) = ; ..- 2 in jk (x, y) 308
