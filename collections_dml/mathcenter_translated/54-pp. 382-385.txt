Rosit3 1 khabib-bulat@mail.ru; Bashkir State University 2 Zilya-apa@mail.ru; Bashkir State University 3 Rozit@mail.ru; Bashkir State University Let M-a subharmonic function with a measure of rice νm in the area of ​​D from the N-Maloen Euclidean space CN, f-non-molomorphic in D function, | F | ≤ EXP M on D and function F is turned to zero on the set Z ⊂ D. Then the restrictions on the growth of the measure νm function M near the border of the region D entail certain restrictions on the size or area/volume of the Month. The quantitative form of research of this phenomenon is given in subharmonic framing. Key words: holomorphic function, zero set, subharmonic function, measure of risa, measure of Hausdorf. Multidimensional results about the description of the zero sets of the holomorphic functions with restrictions on the growth of their module near the border ∂D of the determination of D until the mid-1990s. Contained in the book [1], in articles [2] - [4], reviews [5, 6.5], [6, § 6]. So, in the case of a limited non -equal holomorphic function, it is known that the volume of its zero set is limited (part of the classical G. Henkin Theorem - Mastyu), and in the case of no more degree growth of the unnecessary holomorphic function of the same growth order (chas the theorem of Sh. M. Dautov - footing). The case of entire functions of many variables is quite fully covered in [7] - [12]. Some subharmonic multidimensional results of this type were obtained relatively recently in [13]. For holomorphic and subharmonic functions in areas on a complex planeist of the subject under consideration, it is described quite in detail in [14]. We consider only the “light part” of the task of describing the zero (under) many holomorphic functions with a given majority: the necessary conditions in the form of restrictions on the growth of the “area - overall” zero set near the boundary of the determination area. But it is given in the most general form: for arbitrary areas and a very wide range of conditions as in relation to restrictions on the growth of B.N. Khabibullin, Z.F. Abdullina, A.P. Rosit 383 modules of the holomorphic functions, and a variety of integral restrictions on their zero sets. Let D-own sullenity in CNinct: = cn ∪ {φ} The monotine compacting of Alexandrov N-Malicious Euclidean space CN. For an extended numerical function V (with values ​​B [− least,+inous]), determined near the border ∂D, LIM ∂D V = 0 will mean that lim d∋z → ∂d v (z) = 0. We write s BD, if the clusing of the CLOSS set S VCN mast is contained in D. For measures µ and function V near ∂d we will write ˆ ∂d v dµ for \ s v dµ with any Borel subsets S BD, when only the limb is important ( convergence) integral, - an analogue of the common recording of non -universal integrals ´ least without specifying the lower integration limit. Through SBH (D) and Hol (D) we denote the classes, respectively, subharmonic and holomorphic in D functions; SBH+(D) - a subclass of positive (≥ 0) functions in SBH (D); Zero f - a divine of zeros of the function f ∈ Hol (D), that is, in a certain sense, the function of the multiplicity of the roots of the function f in the field of D. The analogue of the main finite positive functions of the theory of distributions of L. Schwartz, or generalized functions, through which the ratio of the order is determined Distributions or measures/charges, here is a definition. The subharmonic function V ≥ 0, determined near ∂D, with LIM ∂D V = 0, call the test function for D near ∂D, and the class of all such functions we denote through SBH+0 (∂D). For b ∈ [0,+φ) and the subset in CNinct S BD, i.e., at s = closs ⊂ D, we introduce the subclass of test functions sbh+0 (d \ s; ≤ b): = {v ∈ Sbh+ (D \ S): SUP D \ S V ≤ B, LIM ∂D V = 0}. Theorem 1 (individual). Pass - least ̸≡ m ∈ SBH (D) with a measure of rice νm and for an extended numerical function W near ∂d we have ´ ∂d w than usa <+φ, 0 ̸ = f ∈ Hol (D) and | F | ≤ Exp M on d ⊂ cninct. Then for any function vlexbh+0 (∂d) when limiting v ≤ w on any Borelevsky set, on which the νm measure is concentrated, there is a ratio of ´ ∂d v zdσ2n-2 <+φ for any submachine Z≤zero f. Everywhere further we assume that ∅ ̸ = ints ⊂ s = closs ⊂ D, where ints is the inside of the set S in CNinct.
