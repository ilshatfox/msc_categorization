Sufficient conditions for the periodicity of the group S.V. Aleshin is not locally final groups, named Bernsaydov in honor of W. Bernside, who in 1902 the problem of their existence, in the figurative expression of Yu. I. Merzlyakov [1] "still impressed Lunar soil ". The first example of Bernsaydova’s group, given not by the contact, but as a group of autorphisms of the mathematical object, was the group of S.V. Aleshin [2]. In [3] the design of S.V. Aleshina applies to all simple numbers P and a sufficient condition for the frequency of the Aleshin P -groups is given. R.I. Grigorchuk raised the question of finding the necessary conditions for such frequency. Let p -a simple number, v = gf (p) p is a vector about wandering, ă = {0, 1} p -p is the dimensions of 0 and 1. Determination. We put v = (v1, v2, ..., vp) ∈ V, ă (ă1, ă, ..., ising) ∈ Did. The subset σ ⊆ lection is called canceling if for any v ∈ V there is ă ∈ σ such, 134 A.V. Rozhkov, M.V. Rozhkova that (₽, v) = ăv1 + ă2v2 + ... + tipvp = 0. We will call the canceling multiplication minimal if no his own subset is canceled. A sufficient condition for frequency [3] claims that the settings of the sets, which sets one of the generators, contains infinitely many elements of some cancellation of a set. A necessary condition is a complete description of all the minimum canceling sets. Theorem 1. A set containing 1+2+...+p = p (p+1) 2 elements, we call it canonical, is minimal: it has p single -element subsets (1, 0, ..., 0), (0, 1, 0, ..., 0), ..., (0, ..., 0, 1); P - 1 two -element submarines (1, 1, 0, ..., 0), (0, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0), ..., (0, ..., 0, 1, 1, 1, one); etc., and one p elemental set (1, 1, ..., 1). Theorem 2. The minimum cancellation of the P (p+1) 2 elements holds and is obtained from the canonical canal of the number by the use of permutations π1, π2, ..., πp ∈ SP to the coordinates of all one -elemental, two -element, etc. subset. According to the set σ, we build polynomial f (x): f (x1, x2, ..., xp) = ∏ complaing (x ă 1 + x ctor 2 + ... + x Did p). If there are a lot of σ canceling, then the polynomial f (x) is nullify, i.e. F (v) = 0∀v ∈ V. The opposite is true. The idea of ​​evidence is that any anletting polynomial belongs to the ideal ID (XP1 - X1, X P 2 - X2, ..., X P P - XP). M.V. Rozhkova, A.V. Rozhkov 135 L and T R A T R A 1.

There are similar tasks available to schoolchildren and students, and in theo Rii of numbers [3]. An additional incentive is that the task may not have a universally recognized solution and its occupation is not just a training training, but a real scientific experiment at the advanced lines of knowledge. Exactly what is the spirit of STEM technologies-Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics [1]. Example 1. Study of the properties of the Euler function φ (n).
