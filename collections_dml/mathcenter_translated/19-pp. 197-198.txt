One modified marginal task of the type of ricke for meta -analytical functions in an exceptional case, let L - a simple smooth closed contour, dividing the plane of the complex alternate into the internal region of T+ and external - T-. The following regional task is considered. It is required to find all metaa11. Therapists in the region of T+F11. F+(Z) class CA m2 (T+) P H (2J (L), which satisfy on l, except, perhaps the final 'number of the number of 'Check A1, ..., a, airl /31, ..., /311, the next regional conditional: lf+(t)+g (t) f+(t) = g (t), (1) where l = d2 /dx2 + D2 /DU2 - Laplace operator.

B. This message as an area T+ will consider a single circle with the center at the beginning of the coordinates, i.e. T+ = {z: lzl <1}. case l 1 = l2 = l0, the following main result is established . Theorem. Let l = {t: ltl = 1}. Then the solution of the problem R reduce the solution to the scalar problem of Riemann in the spice. = (-1/4) t2 g (t) e> :; "t l ,, t, g2 (t) = (l/4) tg (t) e-lut, and the function f+(z ) and f- (z) bonds with the analytical components of the desired methaan.
