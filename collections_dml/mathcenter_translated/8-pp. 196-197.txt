The absolute convergence of the ranks of the Fourier coefficients according to bases such as Faber-Shauder is well known that the system of Faber-Shauder wor () (BFSh) is the basis in C [0.1]. It is generated by one function С С ϕ2 (): if m = 2k + l, then onic = onic (2kx - (l - 1)), while it is assumed that Сory (x) is zero outside of the segment [0.1]. Following the same algorithm, you can build GM (x) systems generated by the function G (x), and if G (x) satisfies certain conditions (see, for example, [1]), then this system also forms the basis in with [ 0.1] (BTFSHG-a basis of the Faber-Shauder type generated by G (X)). We denote the AG class of continuous functions, in which a number of Fourier coefficients in BTFSHG are absolutely converged. Theorem. If for the factors Fourier according to BTFSHG functions t (x) the rating is fair | AM (t, G) | ≤ cα22k (m = 2k + l, l = 1 ... 2k, m> 2, α> 1) and Cα <2α−1 - 1, then ag = at. Note 1. This condition is only sufficient, but not necessary. So the function T1 (x) = 4x (1– x) generates the Shaidukov base in C [0.1] (BS) and AT1 = Aware, however, theorem 1 for the factors of Fourier according to the BFSh function T1 (X) are not performed. Note 2. Take as the initial basis of the BFSH, while a consequence of theorem 1 will receive: if g ′ ′ (x) ∈C [0.1] and max | g ′ ′ | <8, then ag = a accord. Note 3. Take the BS as the initial basis of the BS, to 196, but as a result of theorem 1, we get: if g ′ ′ ′ (x) ∈ C [0, 1] and max | g ′ ′ ′ | <48, then ag = at1 = a accord. In particular, this is true if you put g (x) = sin (πx) or g (x) = 8 (x - x3)/3, and the last function is interesting because it is not “symmetrical”. Note 4. If for BTFSHG the equality of AG = AW is true, then for these functions all the statements obtained earlier by the author for the functions of class Airon are automatically fair, in particular, they form an algebra.
