Samoilova2 1 sergey.graf@tversu.ru; Tver State University, Petrozavodsk State University 2 Yana-zavorygina@yandex.ru; Tver State University, Petrozavodsk State University determines the hyperbolic procedure for the convexity of local-one-leaved functions. Todomo -regularness of descending and growth of the hyperbolic order of convexity in classes of single -leaf conformal display of a single circle are proved. Keywords: conformal display, bulge order, regularity theorems. In the geometric theory of the functions of a complex alternating, much attention is paid to convex one -leaf analytical functions and numerous generalizations of the concept of bulge (see, e.g., [1, 2]). Let F - locally single -leaf analytical function in a single circle D⊂ C. The order of the bulge of function F in the circle d (0, r) = {z ∈ C: | z | ≤ r}, 0 <r <1, ​​the number [1] β (f, r) = min θives [0.2π) d dθ arg d f (r eiθ) dθ = min | z | = r re {z f {z f {z f. ′ ′ (Z) F ′ (Z) +1}. Let DH (z0, z) - the hyperbolic distance between the points z0, z ∈ D in the circle d, γh (z0, ρ) = {z ∈ D: dh (z, z0) = ρ} - the circle in D with the hyperbolic center Z0 and hyperbolic radius ρ> 0. 126 Materials of the International School-Conference by the Hyperbolic order of the bulge of function F in the circle DH (Z0, ρ) = {z ∈ D: DH (Z, Z0) ≤ ρ} Let's call the number βH (f, z0, ρ ) = min zăγh (z0, ρ) d dθ argt f (z), where θ is the argument of the hyperbolic radius connecting the point z ∈ γH (z0, ρ) with the center Z0, and t f (z) = ddθ f ( Z) - a tangent vector to the image of a circle γH (z0, ρ) when displayed F at point f (z). Theorem 1 [3]. For local single -leaf analytical vdfunction f and z0 ∈D, ρ> 0, the ratio βH (f, z0, ρ) = βh (f̃, 0, β) = β (f̃, eρ–1 eρ+ are fair 1) = min Zorn (z0, ρ) re {z - z0 1 - | z0 | 2 ((1 - z0z) f ′ ′ (z) f ′ (z) −2z0) +1}, where F̃ (ζ) = f (ζ+z0 1+z0ζ). The symbol S indicate the family of single analytical in D functions F, such as F (0) = F ′ (0) −1 = 0. B [4] The regularity of the growth and descending of the convexation order β (f, r) in the subclass C ⊂ S converted display. In the course of the message, regularity theorems for βH (F, Z0, ρ) in C and S will be presented. Theorem 2 [3]. Let F ∈C, Z0 ∈D, ρ> 0, R (ρ) = E ρ−1 eρ+1 and f̃ (ζ) = f (ζ+z0 1+z0ζ). Then 1) βh (f, z0, ρ) ≥ E --ρ; 2) βh (f, z0, ρ) e ρ and re {ei t r (ρ) f̃ ′ ′ (ei t r (ρ)) f̃ ′ (ei t r (ρ)) +1} eρ do not decrease according to ρ on (0,+urb) for any t ∈ [0.2π); 3) there are constant Δ ∈ [1,+و & & t0 ∈R, such that lim ρ →+ger {ei t0r (ρ) f̃ ′ (ei t0r (ρ)) f̃ ′ (ei t0r (ρ)) +1} eρ = lim ρ →+gerβ (f, z0, ρ) e ρ = δ; 4) constant Δ = 1 then and only when f (z) = z (1+ E —I T0 - Z0 1 - E --i T0 Z0 Z) −1. In class S, the regularity theorem occurs only for decreasing βH (f, z0, ρ) and only for hyperbolic radii ρ <ln p 3. Theorem 3 [3]. Let F ∈ S, Z0 ∈ D, 0 <ρ <ln p 3, r (ρ) = eρ−1eρ+1 and f̃ (ζ) = f (ζ+z0 1+z0ζ). Then 1) βh (f, z0, ρ) ≥ 3 - E 2ρ eρ+1; 2) βh (f, z0, ρ +1 3 - e2ρ and re {ei t r (ρ) f̃ ′ ′ (ei t r (ρ)) f̃ ′ (ei t r (ρ)) +1} eρ +1 3 - E2ρ do not decrease according to ρ on (0, ln p 3) for any t ∈ [0.2π); S.Yu. Count, Ya.I. Samoilova 127 3) There are constant Δ ∈ [1,+φ] and t0 ∈R, such that lim ρ → ln p 3 re {ei t0r (ρ) f̃ ′ ′ (ei t0r (ρ) f̃ ′ (ei t0r (ei t0r ( ρ)) +1} eρ+1 3 - E2ρ = = LIM ρ → LN P 3 βH (F, Z0, ρ) Eρ+1 3 - E2ρ = Δ; 4) constant δ = 1 then and only when f (z) = (z + e −2i t0 z0 - z0 1 - e - 2i t0 z20 z2) (1+ E –I T0 - Z0 1 - E - I t0 z0 z) −2. The message also supposes to discuss the regularity of a change in the procedure for the bulge and hyperbolic order of the bulge in the classes of α-conap conformal display, satisfying the condition re {z f ′ ′ (z) f ′ (z) +1 ≥α, α ∈ [−1/2, one).
