R and one-dimensional movement of uninterrupted plasma in the absence of a magnetic field. In quasineral: \-1 with 64 proximity of the Vlasov-Puisson equation: E FT + IFX-AF .'Pxfu = o, those (1,) ER = - ln - j f du. E No (1) here: 路 I. F (t, x, 路 and) - speed and function of the distribution of ions; t.p - the potential of electric sewn ; L1, e, those, no - constants. The distribution of electrons is accepted by Maxwell -Boltsmanov Kim. The system of equations (1) by introducing the new lagrange Variable L (corresponding variable and) may be led to the integrated system of the species (2) where and (2) (2) (2) x, t, l) = (and, fil), a - some operator acting on function from L. L3 Atier V. M. Teshukov (Lokl. USSR Academy of Sciences, 1985, T. 284, N O 3) The concept of hyperbolism of differentiaal equations was generalized in case of type of system systems (2) from the operator: '-. In this work, the conditions of the hyperbolic integro differential system:-. 1Y (2), the laws of preservation and before: the southern model of a strong rupture were found. The theorem about the stroke of the course behind the front of the jump is shown if the parameters of the incoming flow and the expanse of the spread of the gap are known. 65
