) The strengthening of one theorem about the element of the best approximation is well known (see, for example, [1]) Theorem A. Let N - the endless subspace in LR (A, b) (1 S R <OO). In order for the function of 9o e, the functions F e lr (a, b) the best approach in the according to the spaces, it is enough (with r = 1 in the event that time j (t) is 90 (90 (t) t) is almost everywhere different from zero) and the fulfillment of the condition is ะก / 9 (t) lf (t) - 9o (t) g 1 si9p (f (t) - 9o (t)) dt = o A for any 9 of N . The following theorem V. Let N is the endless subspace in LR (A, B) (1 S R <OO). In order for the function of 9o e, having taken the functions f e lr (a, b) the best approximation in the outskirts of N, it is necessary and sufficiently the fulfillment of the condition / 9 (t) LF (t) - 9o (t) g 1 si9n (f (t) - 9O (t)) dt s [a, b] \ e s (1- si9n (r -1)) / j9 (t) ldt (1) e 201 dmj of any G of n, where e = {{{{{{{{{{{ t e [a, b]: f (t) - go (t) = o}. An example has been built, showing that equality in (1) is achieved.

Sitnik (Voronezh, Mathsms@yandex.ru) generalizations of Koshi-Bunakovsky inequalities in spaces with indefinite metric in the works [1-2] Generalizations of the inequalities of Koshi-Buna Kovsky in integral and discrete forms were obtained. For example, the clarification of discrete inequality has the form (1) where the middle part A (x, y) is determined by the arbitrariness. Similar generalizations were obtained for the inequality of Koshi Bunakovsky in the spaces of Minkovsky-Lorenu with a familiar norm. Theorem. Let p p x5-> z :::::: o, u5 - l yt;?: 0. k = i k = l then is fair with the middle part a (x, y) from (1): (Houo - t, x.yk) '~ (Houo - j a (x, y))' ~ 202
