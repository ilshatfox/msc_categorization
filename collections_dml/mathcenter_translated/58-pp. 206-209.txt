Chernova1 1 chernova_olga@bsu.edu.ru; The Belgorod State Research University, the Institute of Engineering and Digital Technologies in the article examines a special case of a linear conjugation problem for a common elliptical system with comprehensive coefficients. It is shown that the choice of a successful reversible linear substitution allows you to reduce the overall elliptical system to the equivalent canonical system, while the initial regional condition will be expressed through the elements of some auxiliary matrices. Applying the results of the classical theory of the singular operators and a number of auxiliary statements established Fredgolmov's resolution of the task. Keywords: Helder's weight space, the task of linear conjugation, the index, the elliptical system, let the open set D = C γ of the complex plane C consists of the unification of the final area D1 and the infinite area D2. The contour γ is supposed to be simple oriented belonging to the class C 1, ν with an indicator 0 <ν <1. Consider in D system L of linear differential equations of the first order A1 ∂U (z) ∂x + a2 ∂u (z) ∂y + a ( z) u (z)+b (z) u (z) = f (z), z ∈ D, where the coefficients for senior members are constant matrices A1, A2 ∈ CL × L, A (Z), B (Z) Matrix l × l class C (D) and F (Z) is L - folly. We introduce the matrix a ∈ Cl × L, which does not have material values ​​and denote L1 and L2 its own values ​​(taking into account the multiplicity), which, respectively, in the upper and lower half -fluids, and the L = L1 + L2. The set of all its own values ​​of the matrix A will write down in the form convenient for us σ̃ = σ1 ∪σ2, σ j ⊆ {λ, Imλ> 0}. Here the feature means comprehensive conjugation. As shown in [4] the previous system can always be represented in the next equivalent form ∂u (z) ∂y - a∂u (z) ∂x +a (z) u (z) +b (z) u (z) = F (z). (1) For the system (1), we consider the task of the linear conjugation set by the condition C11u +(t) −c12u - (t) = f (t), t ∈ γ, (2) where l × l - intestinal coefficients C11 and C12 belong Class Ca (γ). O.V. Chernova 207 will show that the system (1) is reduced to the equivalent elliptic system recorded in the canonical form. According to [4] there is such a reversible L × L Matrix B the block structure b = (B11 B12 B21 B22) = (B1, B 2), BI J SRLI × L J, (3) that equality is B -1 AB = J̃, Where the matrix J has the following block type J̃ = (J1 0 0 J2), where in turn the matrix Ji ∈ Cli × LI are recorded in the housing form, while their diagonal elements are many σi. Note that in the formula (3) through b j, j = 1.2, a rectangular matrix-dot is indicated B J = ↓ (B1 J, B2 J) ∈ CL × L J, J = 1.2. We introduce into consideration of the L -component integrated function φ̃ = (φ1, φ2), through φ1 the first L1 component of the function φ̃, and through φ1 the following L2 component and apply to the system (1) replacement φ̃ = B - 11U. (4) Then, reversing F̃ = B - 11f = (F1, F 2), we get ∂φ̃y ∂y - j̃ ∂φ̃ ∂x + (b --1ab) φ̃ (z) + (b - 11bb) φ̃ (z) = F̃ (z). By introducing the following designations for block matrices (B -1AB) = (C̃11 C̃12 C̃21 C̃22), (B - 1BB) = (D̃11 d̃12 d̃21 d̃22) The last equation can be written in the corresponding block record: ∂φ1 ∂y - J1 ∂φ1 ∂x + C̃11 (Z) φ1 (Z)+ C̃12 (Z) φ2 (Z)+ D̃11 (Z) φ1 (Z)+ D̃12 (Z) φ2 (Z) = F1 (Z), ∂φ2 ∂Y - J 2 ∂ 2 ∂ φ2 ∂x+ c̃21 (z) φ1 (z)+ c̃22 (z) φ2 (z)+ d̃21 (z) φ1 (z)+ d̃22 (z) φ2 (z) = f2 (z). By replacing the second equation of this block system comprehensively, we get an elliptical system in canonical form ∂φ (z) ∂y - j ∂φ (z) ∂x + cφ (z) + dart (z) = f0 (z), (5) coefficients which are expressed by the formulas C = (C̃11 D̃12 D̃21 C̃22), D = (D̃11 C̃12 C̃21 D̃22). 208 “Lobachev Readings - 2019” note that the matrix J of the system (4) is composed of Zhordan's cells with diagonal elements of sets σ1 and σ2. For the case C (Z) = D (Z) = F (Z), the system (5) was studied by daglis [1] in the framework of the so -called hypercomplex numbers. This system plays an important role in the study of elliptical systems of the second and higher orders [2], [3]. Substitute (4) to the regional condition (2), then taking into account the designations (3) we have C11 (B1φ +1 +B2φ +2) —C12 (B1φ - 1 +B2art) = F. Next, we introduce a 2l × 2l matrix T = (T11 T 22 T21 T 12), where L × L - TI J (T), I, J = 1.2, in the designation (3) have a clear view T11 = (C11B1 O), T12 = (C12B1 O), T21 = (O C 11B2), T22 = (O C 12B2), (6) A zero matrix of the corresponding procedure is indicated here through O O. We regroup the components of the function φ and then, taking into account (6), we get the regional condition in the form of t11φ+(t) –T12φ - (t)+t21φ+(t) –T22φ - (t) = f0 (t), t ∈ γ. (7) Thus, the initial task (1) - (2) came to the equivalent task (5) - (7). The solution to the problem (1) - (2) we are looking for in the class Cµ Δ (d̂, least), which is introduced in [5].
