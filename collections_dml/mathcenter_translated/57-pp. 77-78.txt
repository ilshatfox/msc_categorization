The equations of the fractional order in the spaces of generalized integrated functions of A.V. Burobin1 1 Burobin@iate.obninsk.ru; Upninsky Institute of Atomic Energy of NIAU MEFU examines the equations of the fractional order. The properties of decisions of linear equations in the spaces of generalized integrated functions are discussed. Key words: Abel equation, linear equations of the fractional order, space of generalized integrated functions. As you know, the equation of Abel [1] ∫ x 0 onic (t) d t (x - t) γ = f (x), x ∈ [0.1], γ ∈ (0.1). (1) It has a formal solution onic (x) = b - 1 (γ, 1–γ) d d x ∫ x 0 f (t) d t (x - t) 1–γ. The left part of the equation (1) with an accuracy to the coefficient is a fractional integral of the riman-luville of the order (1–γ): i 1–γ 0+ ∗ = 1 γ (1–γ) ∫ x 0 onic (t) d T (x- t) γ. Earlier [2], the introduction of functions c (α) ([0.1]), α <0, obtained as expansion of space C (0) ([0.1]) was discussed. The following theorem 1. with any γ ∈ (0.1), there is a spaceship (−1+γ) ([0.1]), in which equation (1) has the only solution with any right part F ∈C ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ([0) ( 0.1]). The operator I 1–γ0+ at the same time has the following property: Theorem 2. Operator I 1–γ0+: C (−1+ γ) ([0.1]) → C (0) ([0.1]) is limited. It displays c (−1+γ) ([0.1]) on C (0) ([0.1]). We introduce the operator D1 --γ0+ = [i 1–γ 0+] −1 of fractional differentiation. Then, in conditions of theorem 1 D 1–γ 0+ F (x) = γ (1–γ) onic (x). (2) Note that d1 --γ0+ fγ (x) = 0 for the function fγ = x --γ. Therefore, if we consider equality (2) as an equation relative to F (x), then you can detect ambiguity in determining its solution. However, subject to F (0+) = 0 (3), such an equation has only a trivial solution. 78 Materials of the School-Conference under the same condition (3) Consider the linear equation [1] D 1–γ 0+ F (x) = A (X) F (X)+ F (X). (4) In particular, the case of the coefficient A (x) = A0XS is of interest. It is assumed that this equation has a solution F (x), and d1 --γ0+ f ∈C (−1+ γ) ([0.1]). Theorem 3. Let F ∈C (−1+γ) ([0,1]). Then the solution F equation (4) belongs to the space C (0) ([0.1]). When fulfilling the conditions of theorem 3, the solution of equation (4) is a continuous solution to the integral equation f (x) = 1 γ (1–γ) ∫ x 0 a (t) d t (x - t) γ + 1 γ (1 - γ) ∫ x 0 f (t) d t (x - t) γ. Note that the study of linear equations can serve as a basis for studying nonlinear equations, when in the right side of the equation (4) f = f (x, f). Literature 1. Samko S. G., Kilbas A.

UDC 517.95 On the ultimate behavior of solutions to the elliptical regional problem in the cone of V.B. Vasiliev1, Sh.Kh. Kutaib2 1 vbv57@inbox.ru; Belgorod State National Research University 2 1167542@bsu.edu.ru; The Belgorod State National Research University The article discusses some regional tasks for elliptical pseudo -diodecture equations in the cone and discusses the question of the behavior of the solution of the regional problem, when the cone solution strives for zero. In the particular case, it is shown that such a limit exists only if the boundary function of the satisfied functional syngular integral equation.
