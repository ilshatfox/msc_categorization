The automatic continuity of positive operators is well known, positive linear display in ordered banach spaces with some additional assumptions are automatically continuous. Apparently, the strongest result in this direction belongs to G. Ya. Lozanovsky (see [1, chap. 6, §2], [2, theorem 1.2.1], [3, consequence 6]). The purpose of this message is to summarize the result of Lozanovsky, in particular, in the event of metriezed topological vector spaces. Recall that the wedge is the subset of the material vector space, satisfying the conditions k +k ⊂ k, λk ⊂ k (λ ∈ R +). The wedge k is called a cone if k ∩ −k = {0}. Let X-F-space with invariant metric ρ and | x | ≡ ρ (x, 0) (x ∈ X) (see [4, II.1]). We will say that the wedge k in x has an assembly, if the convergence of the numerical series is ∑ | xn | (xn ∈ K) entails convergence in the X series ∑ xn to an element from K. Theorem. Let X1 and X2-two F-space with wedges K1 and K2, and the wedge K1 gives rise to X1 (i.e., x1 = k1–k1) and has assembly, and K2-a closed cone. Then any linear operator from X1 to X2, translating K1 to K2, is continuous. Consequence. Let the X1 and X2 be two full metrhysable topological vector spaces with closed cones of positive elements K1 and K2, and K1 gives rise to X1. Then any linear positive operator from X1 to X2 is continuous. The work was supported by the program “Universities of Russia - Fundamental Research” (project UR 04.01.011). 86 L and T R A T R A 1.
