Quasichebyshevsky subspacies in c (q, x) if z is a banahu space, l - closed subspace in z, x ∈ Z \ L, then plx = {y ∈ L: ‖x --Y = = inf zăl ‖x --z ‖}. Let X - reflexive strictly convex space. Let's say that X has a property (*) if in x ∗ there is such a complete minimum system (fk) φk = 1, which for any n ∈ N many an = {x ∈ X: ∃ onic ∈ [(fk) nk = nk = 1], ‖ices = 1, onic (x) = ‖x‖} is certainly. Note that the space is LP, 1 <p < +φ has a property (*). Theorem 1. Let Q - counting compact, X has a property (∗). Then in C (q, x) there are such subspace l, e, that: 1) Dim l = codim l = +urb; 2) E = C (Q, X); 3) PLG is a single-point ∀ g ∈ E. Theorem 1 is of interest in connection with the following known task: does any separatic space C (Q, X) Chebyshevsky subspace l, Dim l = codim l = +inous contains? If L, E is the subspace in C (Q, X), then D (L, E) - Hausdorfova Metric between single balls of spaces E, L. Theorem 2. Let Q - counting compact, l ⊂ c (q, x), DIM L = CODIM L = +inous. Then ∀ ε> 0 there are such subspace E ⊂ c (q, x) and the counting subset a ⊂ c (q, x), a = c (q, x), which: 1) d (l, e) <ε, 2) peg 6 = Ø if g ∈ A. B. N. Khabibullin (Ufa) 223
