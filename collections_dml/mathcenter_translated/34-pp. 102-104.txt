Procedational methods for solving integrated equations of the I with the Kilbert nucleus on an open circuit I. N. Zamaleev Kazan State University, zail-w@rambler.ru examines the singular integral equation (S.I.U.) 1 2A ∫ +A —a ctg σ - s 2 onic (σ) dσ + 1 2a ∫ + a – a h (s, σ) onic (σ) dσ = f (s), | s | <a, 0 <a <π, (1) where h (s, σ), f (s) are known, and onic (s) - the desired functions, and the singular integral is understood in the sense of the main sense of the Koshi -Lebey [one]. The function g (s, σ) = ctg σ - s 2 - 2 σ - s ∈ C [—a, a] 2, therefore, to solve equation (1), the theory of close methods of solving S.I.U. With the core of the cat on a cut of the material axis (see, for example, the monograph [2] and the bibliors in it). According to this theory, a pair of functional spaces x = ° l2p [—a, a] = {x ∈ L2P [—A, A]: ∫ +A —A P (σ) dσ = 0}, Y = L2Q are introduced. [—A, a], p (σ) = 1√ A2 - σ2, q (s) = √ a2 - s2, and the solution of equation (1) is searched in the form . Then S.I.U. (1) equivalent to the operator equation kx ≡ sx+gx+v x = y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y), (2) 104 where x = 1 π ∫+a –A p (σ) σ - s dσ - s dσ - s dσ , V x = 1 2π ∫ +a —a p (σ) h (s, σ) x (σ) dσ. Theorem. Operator S is continuously turn from x to y, and ‖s‖x → y = ‖s -1‖y → x = 1. Let S.I.U. (2) is solved using the general projection method [2]. To do this, the endless subspecies are introduced by XN = ° Hn = Hn∩x and Yn = Hn - 1 ⊂ Y, where HN is many algebraic polynomas of the degree not higher than n ∈ N. The approximate solution XN (t) ∈ XN equations (1) is located as The solution of the operator equation KNXN ≡ pnsxn + pngxn + pnv xn = pny, xn ∈ XN, pn ∈ £ (y, yn)), (3) where £ (y, yn) - many linear polynomial moat from Y to YN. Note that the equation (3) is equivalent to the system from Nee Nonal Algebraic equations relative to the unknown coefficients of the polynoma xn (t) ∈ XN. Theoretical justification of the computing scheme (1) - (3) in the sense of Ch. 14 books [3], in particular, the convergence of the approximate rivers to the exact in two cases: 1) pn → e (n → و) is proven in Y, where E is a single operator; 2) P 2N = PN, and PN: y - → yn ⊂ y are unlimited, and pn: c [—a, a] - → Y are limited in terms of norm in the aggregate. Note that the first case covers such well -known methods as, for example, the methods of gallerkin, moments, the shame of the squares and oscilling functions. The second case covers 105 methods of collocation type with various methods of choosing collocation nodes. L and T R A T R A 1. Michlin S.G., Prössdorf S.

Zverev Kazan State University, zverev@pai.ru tasks of diffraction of electromagnetic waves on periodic structures are the classic tasks of the Namika electrode and are based on Maxwell’s equations (see, for example, [one]). A number of tasks, in particular, the tasks of scattering the flat field of a risisic electromagnetic wave by periodic structures are formulated in the form of regional tasks for the Helmholtz equations ∆U + k2u = 0, where K is a wave number, ∆ - opera Rator Laplace (see, for example, [2 ]). When the wave scattering with metal structures, in the visibility of polarization, the task of the conductor u (x, y) | S = f (x, y) 106 is considered
