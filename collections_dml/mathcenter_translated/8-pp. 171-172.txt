Indexes of the defect of the singular differential operators of one of the tasks of the spectral theory of the singular differential operators are the task of studying the defect indices of the minimum differential operator generated in L2 [0, φ) with a self -consolidated expression of the type: LY = (−1) ny2n + n - 1 q = 0 (−1) k (y (k) pn -k (x)) (k), depending on the behavior of its coefficients PK (x), k = 1, n (see bibliography in [1] and [2]) . One of the method of studying the defect indices is to obtain and analysis at X → φ 171 asymptotic formulas for the fundamental system of solutions of the equation LY = λY, IM λ 6 = 0, since it is known that the number of defect indices coincides with the amount of L2 -sub -decisions of the specified equation. The most difficult is the so -called degenerated case when the main contribution to the asymptotic formulas is made by a group or one of the intermediate coefficients. This case is devoted to the study of this case, as well as work [1], [2]. Subject to regularity, in the sense of titchmarsha-Levitan coefficients, asymptotic formulas of the fundamental system of solutions of the LY = λY equation, as well as the class of differential operators with any possible defect indices, were identified. The work was supported by the Russian Federation (project 01-01-00996a). L and T R A 1. Nazirova E. A.
