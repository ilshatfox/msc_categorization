The new parametric representation of the classes of the Nevanlinna -Jerbasyan Let D - a single circle on a complex plane. We denote through Aα (α> 0) the class of non -vanin -jerbashyan holomorphic in D functions F, for which ∫ 1 0 ∫ π −π (1 - r) α -1 ln + | f (reiison) | rdrdθ < + وged. (1) Following M.M. Harbasyan, consider the endless work of bβ (z, zk) = +ger k = 1 (1- z zk) exp {−Wβ (z, zk)}, (2) where Wβ (z, zk) = β 2π ∫ 1 0 ∫ π --π (2 (1- ZE --i θ) β+1 - 1) (1- t) β -1 × × ln ∣∣∣∣1 - teiison ∣∣∣∣ dtdθ. Theorem 1. Let 0 <α <β <α +1 and {zk} +gerk = 1 - arbitrary sequence from D, for which the condition +ger k = 1 (1- | zk |) β +1 < + ∞. (3) Then the function is Bβ (Z, ZK) belongs to the Aα class. 242 Theorem 2. Let 0 <α <β <α + 1. Then the class Aα coincides with the class of functions F, allowing to D representation f (z) = eiγ + λkβ zλb (z, zk) Exp {1 2π ∫ π π π Sβ (ze θ θ) ψ (θ) dθ}, (4) where sβ (z) = 2/(1 - z) β+1 - 1, {zk}+ger = 1 - arbitrary sequence of D, satisfying Condition (3), bβ (z, zk) - work (2), ψ (θ) = lim ρ → 1–0 1 γ (β) ∫ ρ 0 (ρ - t) β -1 ln ∣∣f (teiison ) ∣∣ dt (5) - a material function from class Osov λ1,1,1β -α on a single circle, kβ = β ∑+و n = 1 1 n (n+β), λ is an arbitrary non -negative number, γ - material number.

[1]). In Terms of the Charny Hydraulic Model We Examine the Known and Obtain New Solutions to Problems of Dynamics of Abrupt Interface Layers. The General Charney PDE of Nonlinear Diffusion Is Reduced to a Nonlinear Ode in Cases of a Stable Finger, a Travelingwave Finger, And Rotating Siteface With EXPLITH EXPLOROUTHEROS SUGOROUS SIGOROUROUROUS A peculiarity of the Solutions Is the Degeneration of the Governing Aquation The Finger Possesses One Degeneration Point and Extends Infinite Upstream Where Flow of the Moving Phase Is Uniform. We Analyze Also SuperPropagation of An Interface with Two Degeneration Points in 243
