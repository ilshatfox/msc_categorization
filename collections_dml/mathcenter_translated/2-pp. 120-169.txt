Obstacle inside the region. The approximate definition of the free border 1 1. Introduction is well known that a considerable number of stationary tasks with free boundaries can be directly (or after some transformations) is formulated in the form of elliptical variational inequalities with an obstacle inside the region u ∈ K: 〈au, v - u〉 ≥ (F, v-u) ∀v ∈ K (1.1) 1 work was carried out with the support of the RFFIF, projects N 98-01-00200, 99-01 00957, and the Grant of the RT RT 120 Foundation with a linear or quasi-line elliptical operator of the second order a, where K corresponds to one -sided restriction: k = {v ∈ V G: v ≥ 0 in ω}, v G = {v ∈W 12 (ω): v = g on ∂ω}. In monographs [1] - [6] examples of various physical tasks leading to such inequalities are considered. 2 The stronger side of the formulation of the task with the free border in the form of variation inequality is that it does not contain clearly unknown, characterizing the free border. This turns out to be very useful, as it allows you to study the properties of the solution and build the algorithms of its approximate definition (through the end -to -end scheme), practically ignoring the presence of an unknown border: it is restored after the solution of inequality (1.1) as the boundary of Fli - many adjustment of the decision to the obstacle (coinocument sets): i = {x ∈ ω: u (x) = 0}, f = ∂ (ω \ i) ∩ ω. Note that in many practical situations the border F and many I are no less interest than the solution of the inequality u (x). For their approximate definition of traditional, the following sequence of actions is. Using any grid method, for example, the method of final elements, we obtain a sequence of approximation UH (x) converging to the exact solution of U (X) of the problem (1.1). Knowing UH (x), we find a close coinCIENT IH and close free border FH. Note that the latest operations are ambiguous and many IH, FH can be determined in different ways. In other words, the free border is found using one or the procedure of aposterior processing of the approximate solution of UH. It is most natural to accept ih = {x ∈ ω: uh (x) = 0}, fh = ∂ (ω \ ih) ∩ ω. 2Kniga [1] is an excellent introduction to the subject, contains the basics of theory and reaches the most difficult problems associated with the smoothness of free boundaries. The book [2] is devoted to a systematic study of close methods of solving variational inequalities. 121 This method of determining the FH was studied by Bretzi and Kaffarelli [7]. They considered the MKE scheme based on linear final elements in the case when a is the Laplace operator with a reverse sign. In the assumption of the justice of the discrete principle of the maximum, the condition of the disorder of the solution in the vicinity of f, as well as subject to f ≤ cf <0 in ω, cf = const, (1.2), it is shown that with fairly small h (10) meas (i∆ih) ≤ ε, ε = o (‖u - uh‖1/2l least (ω)), (20) fh ⊂ oε (f), oε (f) = {x ∈ R2: DIST (X, F) ≤ ε}, where ∆ means the symmetrical difference in sets. If we take into account that subject to U ∈ W 2inger (ω) and with the validity of the discrete principle of the maximum in [8], the assessment ‖u - uh‖linger ≤ ch2 ln (1/h) is proved, then from (20) It follows that in the best case, FH AP proximizes F in distance with the accuracy O (H ln1/2 (1/h)). This is practically the optimal result with this definition of FH. We also note the works of Weinelt [9], [10], [11], which considered a similar definition of a free border when using a variable scheme on an orthogonal grid to solve inequality with a linear operator without mixed derivatives. He received an accuracy assessment of the distance H3/4 LN1/2 (1/H) when fulfilling the condition (1.2). Another method of determining IH and FH was proposed and investigated in the works of R. Nochetto [12], [13], [14]. At first, a specially regulatory problem (1.1) is solved by MKE (linear elements) and is UH. Then, IH = {X ∈ ω: UH (x) ≤ ε2}, fH = ∂ (ω \ IH) ∩ ω, where ε = o (‖u - uh‖1/2l least (ω)) is determined. The accuracy assessment ‖u - uh‖l least ≤ CH2 ln 2 (1/h) is proved, as well as, subject to (1.2), statement (10) and (20), without the assumption of the justice of the discrete principle of the maximum. 122 The approach that we develop is based on the use of an approximate characteristic function of a coinocent set. For this purpose, we introduce equivalent definitions of the solution of inequality in the form of variational inequality of the 2nd type (paragraph 4.) u ∈ V: 〈au, v-u〉+ j (v)-j (u) ≥ (f, v- u) ∀v ∈ V (1.3) with convex lips-non-term functionality J, and in the case of regular tasks (i.e., when the task au = f has a solution U ∈ W 22) in the form of an operator equation (paragraph 5) U ∈ V: au - f --χ (u) = f in v ∗, (1.4) where χ (u) is the characteristic function of the coinocent set. Based on these formulations in paragraph 6, the methods of the fine and regulatory of inequality (1.1) are considered, stability is studied as the coinocent multiples to the indignation of the right part F (paragraph 7), the MKE scheme for the task (1.1) is built and proposed and the method of determining the free borders (paragraph 8).
