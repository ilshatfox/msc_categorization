Belarus examines the approaches of Markov’s functions of a special species on the segment [−1,1] through partial amounts of the Fourier series according to the system of rational fractions of Chebyshev - Markov. The processing and uniform assessment of approaches, asymptotic expression of uniform assessment, the optimal parameter value, which provides the highest speed of approximation, are established. Key words: Markov’s function, partial amounts of Fourier, Chebyshev’s fractions - Markov, asymptotic estimates. Let µ - a positive Borelev measure with a compact media f = SUPPPµ⊂R. Converting Koshi Measures µ µ̂ (Z) = ∫ f dµ (t) t - z, z ∈C is called Function MARKOVA. Markov's cubmorphic flomorphic vc \ f and rational approximation of such functions are a well -known classical task. One of the first works devoted to this topic is the article by A.A. Gonchara [1]. J. Andersson [2] found the lower serial grades of the best rational LP attachments µ̂ (z) for p ∈ (1,+φ) in a single circle and on the segment, when the measure µ satisfies the following conditions: SUPPPµ = = 1, A], a> 1, dµ (t) = onic (t) d t and onic (t) ∼ (t −1) α at 1 ≤ t ≤ a, where α> −1/p. A. A. Pekarsky [3] received the upper order assessments of the best uniform rational approaches of Markov’s functions under similar conditions at the measure µ. This issue found further development in the works of many authors (see, for example, [4]- [6]). In this work, the approximation of Markov’s functions on the segment [−1,1] is considered partial amounts of the Fourier series according to one system of rational fractions of Chebyshev - Markov with two geometrically different poles. An integral representation was found for the error of approximations, and under conditions where the measure µ ′ (t) ∼ tγ, 0 <γ <2, an assessment of the error of the approximation at the segment [−1,1], depending on the position of the point X, the uniform assessment and its Asymptotic expression. The value of the parameter was found, at which the best speed of approximation is ensured. As you know [7], the algebraic cosinus trash-Markova on the segment [−1,1] with two geometrically different comprehensively-associated imaging 280 Materials of the school-conference in the poles have the form MN (x) = cosn arccos x √ 1+p2 1+p2x2, x ∈ [−1,1], p ≥ 0, n = 0.1 ,. . . , and with p = 0 it is a classic Polin of Chebyshev of the first kind. The system of rational fractions is orthogonal on the segment [−1,1] with a weight ρ (x, p) = √ 1+p2 (1+p2x2) p 1 - x2, −1 <x <1, p ≥ 0. Functions F ( x), absolutely summarized with the weight ρ (x, p) on the segment [−1,1], we put in line a number of Fourier according to the system of rational fractions of Chebyshev - Markov f (x) ∼ c0 2 + nder n = 1 cn mn mn (x), cn = 2 π 1∫ −1 f (t) mn (t) ρ (t, p) d t, n = 0.1 ,. . . . (1) For partial amounts of a series (1) of a even function f ∈C [−1,1], the presentation of S2N (f, x) = 1 π π/2∫ —π/2 f (cos v) sin occurs [(2n +1) onic (u, v)] sin pul (u, v) λ (v) d v, x = cosu, (2) where λ (y) = 1–α 4 1 +2α2 cos2y +α4, С (u, v) = v∫ u λ (y) d y, x = cosu, α ∈ [0.1). In the future, we will consider the holomorphic functions presented in the form of the integral of the style with the compact carrier µ̂ (x) = ∫ f tdµ (t) t 2 +x2, f = suppµ⊂ [0, +nder), (3) where µ (t) - a limited non -relevant function, taking infinitely many different values. It is also assumed that ∫ f dµ (t) t <mm. (4) We will study the approximations with partial amounts (1) of the function µ̂ (x) determined in (3). For this purpose, we introduce the designation ε2n (x, α) = µ̂ (x) - s2n (µ̂ (x), x), x ∈ [−1,1], (5) ε2n (α) = ∥∥µ̂ (x) - s2n (µ̂ (x), x) ∥∥c [−1,1], n purpose. (6) Theorem 1. Let the measure µ satisfy the condition (4), and the measure ν is determined with the ratio dν (y) = 4y 2 1+ y2 dµ (onic (y)), onic (y) = 1 2 (1 y - y), 0 <y <1. E.A. Rovba, P.G. Skzeko 281 Then, for the error of approximations (5) for x ∈ [−1,1], the equality ε2n (x, α) = (−1) n+1 ∫ √ √ 1+2α2u+α4 1+2y2 cos2u+y4 y4 y4 y4 y. cosn (x, y, α) 1–α2y2 χn (y) dν (y), x = cosu, (7) where α ∈ [0.1), ψn (x, y, α) = argπn (₽)+ Arg (ă2 + y2) (perforate + α2) ă2, χn (y) = (y2 −α2 1–α2y2) n, cil = ei u. Consequence. In the conditions of theorem 1 evenly with x ∈ [−1,1], x = cosu is true inequality | ε2n (x, α) | ≤ ε2n (α) ≤ ∥∥∥∥∥ ∫ √ 1 +2α2 COS2U +α4 1 +2Y2 COS2U +Y4 | χN (Y) | y dν (y) 1 --α2y2 ∥∥∥∥∥ c [−1,1], where ε2n (α) from (6). In the study of Markov’s functions approximations, the servant is often considered when the measure µ (t) is slightly equivalent to the degree function. Such a case is studied by us further. Theorem 2. Let suppaν ∈ [a, 1], 0 ≤ a <1 and µ ′ (t) ∼ tγ, 0 <γ <2. Then, in the conditions of the theorem 1: 1) for the error of the approaches of Markov's functions on the segment [−1 , 1] Partial amounts of a number of Fury-Chebyshev (5) is true inequality: | ε2n (x, α) | ≤ 1 2γ-1 1∫ a √ 1 +2α2 COS2U +α4 1 +2T 2 COS2U +T 4 (1 - T 2) γ tγ - 1 | χn (t) | D
