. Construction of evolutionary determining relations for the final elastic deformations of Novokshanov r.s., Rogovaya A.A. Perm State Technical University, Institute of Mechanics of Continuing Center for the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Perm Currently, the technological processes of the plastic de formation of material are studied both numerically and experimentally. However, most numerical models do not take into account the influence of elastic deformations, which is completely not justified, since many of these processes are reduced to setting contact tasks. This is one of the main reasons for the consideration, in this case, deforming as an elastoplastic with the final defense? The work proposes a kinematic diagram of the elastoplastic deformation, based on the imposition of small elastic deformations on the final. Three types of configurations were included in the consideration: initial, current (relevant) and intermediate, I do not distinguish 128
