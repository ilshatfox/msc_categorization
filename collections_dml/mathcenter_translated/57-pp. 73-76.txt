UDC 517.925.53+51.72 On the factorization of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix Jacobi A.V. Bratishchev1 1 avbratishchev@spark-mail; Don State Technical University Let the autonomous system of differential equations of the nth order have an invariant set. For a state of balance on this set, we form a Jacobi matrix of the right side of the system. The work proposes a formulantactorization of this matrix. The formula is useful in the task of designing regulators of dynamic systems. Key words: autonomous system, invariant set, equilibrium state, characteristic polynomial. Let the autonomous system of the nth order with right-wing parts from the smoothness class C R, R> 0, 74 Materials of the School-Conference   x ′ 1 = F1 (X1, XN) = F1 (X) ,. . . x ′ n = fn (x1,., xn) = fn (x). (1) As you know, the function ψ (x) is a full integral of the system (1) when and only when its derivative by virtue of the system (1) is identical to zero. Geometrically, this means that every set of LC: = {x: ψ (x) = c}, c ∈ R is invariant: the solution of the problem of Koshi with the initial data x0: = (x01, ..., x0n) ∈ LC, always Lies on this set. More general is the question when ψ (x) is a private integral: the set L: = {x: ψ (x) = 0} invariant. It is relevant in the reverse tasks of the dynamics and synergistic theory of management [1]-[3]. Note that the reverse task of describing all differential equations for which this set is invariant was set in [4]. This paragraph summarizes the presence of an invariant set in the system (1). Lemma. Consider the n-dimensional diversity l: = {x: ψ1 (x) = 0, ..., ψm (x) = 0}, m <n, (2) ∀x r anti (∂∂i ∂x j (x)) = m. Let the functions ψ1, ..., ψm and the right parts of the system (1) are connected by the ratios  ∂∂1 ∂x1 f1 (x)+ ...+ ∂∂1 ∂xn fn ( x) = φ1 (ψ1 (x), ..., ψm (x), x1, ..., xn) ,. . . ∂∂m ∂x1 f1 (x)+ ...+ ∂m ∂xn fn (x) = φm (ψ1 (x), ..., ψm (x), x1, ..., xn), where φi ( 0, ..., 0, x1, ..., xn) ≡ 0, i = 1, ..., m. We denote through x (t, x0): = (x1 (t, x0), ..., xn (t, x0)) the solution of the problem for the system (1) with the initial condition x (0, x0) = x0. Let ∀x0 ∈ L and the corresponding, generally speaking system of the system of differential equations   φ′1, t = φ1 (φ1 (t), ..., φm (t), x1 (t, x0) ,. .., xn (t, x0)) ,. . . φ′m, t = φm (φ1 (t), ..., φm (t), x1 (t, x0), ..., xn (t, x0)), (3) the task of the cat φ1 (0) = ... = φm (0) = 0 has the only (zero) solution. Then L is an invariant set of system (1). Proof. It must be proved that ∀x0 ∈ L ∀t = 0   ψ1 (x1 (t, x0), ..., xn (t, x0)) ≡ 0 ,. . . ψm (x1 (t, x0), ..., xn (t, x0)) ≡ 0. A.V. Bratishchev 75 denote φi (t): = ψi (x1 (t, x0), ..., xn (t, x0)), i = 1, ..., m. Then, by force (1), (3) we have   φ′1, t = ∂∂1 ∂x1 f1 (x (t, x0))+ ...+ ∂∂1 ∂xn fn (x (t, x0)) = φ1 (φ1 (t), ..., φm (t), x1 (t, x0), ..., xn (t, x0)) ,. . . φ′m, t = ∂∂m ∂x1 f1 (x (t, x0))+ ...+ ∂m ∂xn fn (x (t, x0)) = φm (φ1 (t), ..., φm (t), x1 (t, x0), ..., xn (t, x0)), that is, the functions φi (t) are a solution to the system of differential equations (3), and with the initial condition φi (0) = ψi ( x01, ..., x0n) = 0, i = 1, ..., m. Due to the conditions of the uniqueness of the solution of this problem, Koshi receive the required ratio. Lemma proven. Consequence. If the functions that determine the variety (2), and the right parts of the system (1) are connected by the private ratios of the type  ∂∂1 ∂x1 f1 (x)+ ∂∂1 ∂xn fn (x) = φ1 (ψ1, ..., ψm) ,. . . ∂∂m ∂x1 f1 (x)+ ...+ ∂m ∂xn fn (x) = φm (ψ1, ..., ψm), where φi (0, ..., 0) = 0, i = 1 ..., m, then instead of (3) it is necessary to require the task of the cat φ1 (0) = ... = φm (0) = 0 for the autonomous system  φ′1, t = φ1 (φ1 , ..., φm) ,. . . φ′m, t = φm (φ1, ..., φm), had the only (zero) solution. Let the autonomous system (1) have an invariant set (2), for which the conditions of Lemma are fulfilled. In the assumption of the analytics of the features of your in the vicinity of the beginning of the coordinates according to all variables, from the condition φi (0, ..., 0, x1, ..., xn) ≡ 0, i = 1, ..., m, there are equality, ∂φi ∂x1 (0, ..., 0, x1, ..., xn) ≡ 0, ..., ∂φi ∂xn (0, ..., 0, x1, ..., xn) ≡ 0, I = 1, ..., m. (4) Let the point x0 = (x01 ..., x01) ∈ L is the state of equilibrium of the system (1), and ∆ = ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ ψ ψgor, XI1 ... ψ′1, XIM .. . ... ... ψ′m, XI1 ... ψ ′ m, XIM ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ x = x0 ̸ = 0 Then there is such a generalization of the theorem 2 of article [5 ]. 76 Materials of the School-Conference of theorem. The characteristic polynomial of the Jacobi matrix of the right part (1) at the point x0 ∈ L can be factorized by the following
