Invariats of the pieces of curls and stratums with the action of the final group on the basis are denoted through the p polyhedra cover B tightened sub-power stems p, q, ... ⊂ b. Consider the piece-and-core main stratification of ă, the basis of which is by definition the polyhedr B, the structural group is k- The measured Tor T K, and the functions of the transition hole between any cards oring and lection of the atlas A (P) associated with the coating P, are smooth on the symptoms of the base. We set on the B Simplian effect of the final group ∆. Raising it to the total space E of the stability hole using Atlas A (P) cards, we get a set of local actions or the pseudo -action of the group ∆ on E. In the work, stratification of this type, allowing the connectedness, invariant regarding the pseudo -acting of the group ∆. A smooth case is studied in [1]. The form of ω on the polyhedr B is called a set of linear forms ωσ on the symplexes σ ∈ B, such that if τ ∈ B the symplex σ ∈ B faces, then the equality ωτ = ωσ | τ ([2] p. 35) occurs. Let the 1-form ωp with the values ​​of the group T K is specified on each element p ∈ P, and for all p, q ∈ P, such as p ⋂ q 6 = ∅, the equality ωp −ωq = θd] is true (here θ is a canonical form on the group T K with values ​​in T). We denote the many pairs (v, x) with the symbol P̂, in which V ∈ E, X is a piece-and-core path in p and p (v) = x (0). Let also 55 ω (e) - the space of the ways of the total space E. Consider the path X: i → p, points g0 ∈ T K and v = oring (g0, x (0)) ∈ E, then (v, x) ∈ P̂ . For t, s ∈ I, put Xt (s) = x (ts) and determine the display hp: p̂ → ω (e) formula hp (v, x) (t) = ising (x (t), g0 - exp (∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ xt ωp)), where EXP: RK → T K = RK/ZK is a factor-collection, and if ω1p, ..., ω k p are components of the form ωp in the standard basis of al Goebra t, then Exp (∫xt ωp ) = EXP (∫ xt ω1p ... ∫ xt ωkp). Offer. Formula H | P = HP sets the connectivity H at the stratification hole. Let's call it a piece of coherence. Theorem 1. On a piece of stratification, then and only then there is a bit of a bit of T K-colation, invariant relative to the pseudo-action of the group ∆ in the total space E, when the transition forms θd tip of atlas a (p) are invariant regarding the action of the group ∆ on B. We call these stratification with a bit of almost ∆-pistance. We determine the 2-form F on B, believing F | p = dωp, and we will call it the basic form of curvature of coherence of H. B [2] for forms on the polyhedr, the theory of claws, similar to the theory of the Maranger's de Rama, has been developed. We denote through h2∆ (b, r | zk) a two -dimensional group of claws of invariant forms on B, integrates in cycles from which have integer values. Theorem 2. The claw class [f] ∆ ∈ H2 thrus (b, rk | zk) the basic shape of curvature f is an invariant in the category of pieces of pieces of almost ∆-pistance. 56 Theorem 3. If the 2-form F on B is closed, invariant relative to the action of the group ∆ and [f] ∆ ∈ H2 thrus (b, rk | zk), then there are a piece-and-hot stratification lection and invariant connectivity H to lection, such as such as that the basic form of curvature of coherence h coincides with f.
