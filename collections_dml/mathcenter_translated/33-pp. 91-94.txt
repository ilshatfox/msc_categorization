The use of the lattice cubic formula for calculating the integral in a particular area1 E. L. Bannikov Institute of Mathematics with the UC RAS, Ufa, it is required to calculate the integral in the eight -dimensional region, which is a direct work of two three -dimensional balls of radii of 1 and two segments [0, 1] , Ω = {x | x ∈ R3, | x | 6 1} 2 × [0, 1] 2. We use lattice cubic formulas with a limited border layer (OPS formulas) [1], the optimal properties of which are theoretically justified [2]. The calculation algorithm for these formulas provides for the calculation of the integral as the sum of local integrals corresponding to the division of the unit in the area of ​​integration, which provides simpler forms of integration of the integration: i (f) ≡ dxf (x) ∼ = h8 ∑ hkuss ckf (hk) ≡ kf (hk) ≡ kf (f), j∑ j = 0 φj (x) ≡ 1 for x ∈ ω, i (f) = j∑ j = 0 ∫ ωj dxφj (x) f (x), ωj = ω ∩ supp φj. The work considers the first stage of solving the problem. At this stage, an integral is calculated with the function φo = φ, for which SUPP φ0 ⊂ int ω, that is, the integral from the function of the function f (x) and the cutting function φ (x) ∈ CM0 (ω), which ensures the circulation of the work φ · F in the vicinity of the border. It is theoretically substantiated that for this terms you can put CK (h) ≡ 1 without violating the optimal properties of the algorithm. The 1st work was carried out with the financial support of the RFFIF, project No. 06-0100597, and programs No. 14 of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences “High-performance calculations and multiprocessor systems”, Section 1.12 “Standard programs for parallel calculations of model tasks” 91 Application of the lattice cubatic formula K. . . The integral from the work is approached by the following formula: ∫ dxφ (x, ε) f (x) ∼ = h8 ∑ hkgr, korn8 φ (hk, ε) f (hk). The cutting function has the type φ (x, ε) ≡ ̂ (x8 ε) ̂ (1 - x8 ε) ̂̂ (x7 ε) ̂̂ (1 - x7 ε) × × ψ (1 - (x26 + x25 + x24) ε) ψ (1 - (x23 + x22 + x21) ε), where ̂̂ (t) = ψ (2t - 1), ψ (t) =    0, t <0, ∫ t 0 0, ∫ t 0 dτ [τ (1 - τ)] m/ ∫ 1 0 dτ [τ (1 - τ)] m, 0 <t <1, 1, t> 1, m - the smoothness of the function f (x). To calculate the integral ∫ ω φ0 (x) f (x) dx, the MA program in C ++ is written using a library of parallel functions of MPI. As parameters, the submarine function f (x) were set by the parameters; Smooth parameter M; thickness ε border layer; The number of graternal points on the edge of a single cube. To clarify the qualitative characteristics of the computing algorithm (calculation accuracy, computing work and counting time), the program was tested on the MVS-15000 multiprocessor computer of the Interdepartmental Superception Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The MVS-15000 has 922 simultaneously working processor with a distributed, that is, a memory separate for each two processor module. We used 600 processors. M = 3, ε = 1/3 remained unchanged parameters, the step of the lattice and the number of processors changed. In table. 1 shows the results of the calculation of the integral in a given area from the work of the cutting function to the function F (x) = 1. 92 E. Bannikova Table 1 H ∫ ω φ0 (x) f (x) dx the number of processor account time (sec) 1/ 7 2.990442 100 24 1/10 2.546245 600 63 1/12 2.546504 600 253 Function F (X) = 1 was chosen because this integral can be easily calculated manually and thereby check the accuracy of the result of the calculation of the program. The exact result is 2, 54695+ + O (10–5), and the table shows that an accuracy of 10–3 was achieved, and with a decrease in the grate pitch, the accuracy increases. Also an important characteristic of the program is the account time, which should be minimal. From the calculation data it is clear that with an increase in the amount of n points of the grill by 2 time, the account increases by 4 times, and the accuracy does not significantly change. This is due to the fact that the area under consideration of a large dimension, and a slight decrease in step H entails a significant increase in time, so it is enough to limit ourselves n = 10. In table. 2 shows the results of testing the program on the functions f (x) = (x1x2) 2 + (x3x4) 2 + (x5x6) 2 + (x7x8) 2 + 1. Here we can judge the accuracy of calculations by the stability of decimal signs after decimalum. Comparison h = 1/10 and h = 1/12 shows the accuracy O (10–3).
