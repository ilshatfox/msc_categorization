The convergence of the collocation method for conditionally correlated integro-radio equations is considered the task of Koshi X (A) = 0, I = 0, M-1, (1) for the integro-radio equation of the type KX ≡ X (M) (t) + m∑ k = 1 gk (t) x (m --k) (t) + p∑ j = 0 b∫ a hj (t, s) x (j) (s) ds = y (t), - Φ <a <t 6 b <mm, (2) where the parameters are m+1, p ∈ N and M <p. As you know, this task is incorrectly set according to Adamar, but under the set conditions it can be set correctly due to the choice of a pair of spaces X desired elements and Y of the right parts. One of these steam is (see [1]) a pair (x, y) Sobolev’s spaces, where y = w p --ml2 and x ⊂w pl2 space of functions that satisfy the initial conditions (1). The norms in these spaces are taken by coordinated: ‖y‖y = ‖y‖l2 + ‖y (p --m) ‖l2 (y ∈ Y), ‖x‖x = ‖x (m) ‖l2 + ‖x (p) ‖L2 (x ∈ X). Sufficient conditions for the correct setting of the problem (1), (2) gives the next 42 Yu. R. Agachev, M. Yu. Pershagin Lemma. Let the conditions are fulfilled: 1) gk, k = 1, m, y ∈ Y; 2) hj ∈ Y × L1, J = 0, m - 1; 3) hj ∈ Y × l2, j = m, p; 4) the task (1), (2) has the only solution for any y ∈ Y. Then the problem of the solution (1), (2) in a pair of spaces (x, y) is set correctly according to Adamar. We will solve the problem (1), (2) by the polynomial method of collocation. We will look for an approximate solution in the form of xn (t) = n∑ k = 1 ck (t - a) k+m - 1, (3) unknown coefficients {ck} we will determine by the method of collocation from the conditions: x (m) n (tl ) + n∑ k = 1 gk (tl) x (m --k) n (tl) + p∑ j = 0 b∫ a hj (tl, s) x (j) n (s) ds = y (tl ), l = 1, n, (4) where {tl} nl = 1 ⊂ [a, b] is some fixed point system. These conditions regarding {ck} are a system of linear algebraic equations with a square matrix. Theorem 1. Let the assumptions make: 1) gk, k = 1, m, y ∈ C (p - m) [a, b] ≡ ỹ; 2) hj ∈ ỹ × l1, j = 0, m - 1; 3) hj ∈ ỹ × l2, j = m, p; 4) the task (1), (2) is unambiguously solved with any y ∈ Y; Yu.R. Agachev, M. Yu. Pershagin 43 5) {tj} nj = 1 - zeros of Polinom Lyandra for the segment [a, b]. Then the system (4) of the bell method has the only solution {c ∗ k} for all n, starting with some N0 ∈ N. Approximate solutions x ∗ n (t) built according to the formula (3) for ck = c ∗ k, k = 1, n, converge to the exact solution x ∗ (t) of the task (1), (2) in space X. The speed of convergence can be characterized by the serial ratio ‖x ∗ - x ∗ n‖x = o {en - 1 (x ∗ (m) ỹ}, where EN -1 (Z) ỹ is the best approximation of the z ∈ ỹ algebraic polynomas of the degree no higher than n - 1. In the class ỹ We introduce a subclass ỹ1 functions, in which the production order P-M satisfies the condition of Dini-Lipshitsa. Theorem 2. Let: 1) gk, k = 1, m, y ∈ ỹ1; 2) hj ∈ ỹ1 × l1, j = 0, m - 1; 3) hj ∈ ỹ1 × l2, j = m, p; 4) the task (1), (2) is unambiguously solved with any y ∈ ỹ; 5) {tj} nj = 1-nodes of Chebyshev I-th or II genus. Then the system (4) of the bell method has the only solution {c ∗ k} for all quite large n. Approximate solutions x ∗ n (t) converge to the exact solution of x ∗ (t) problems (1), (2) in the space x̃ = cp [a, b]. For the error of the feminine solutions in the space X̃, the orderly assessment ‖x ∗ - x ∗ n‖x̃ = o {lnn · en - 1 (x ∗ (m) ỹ} is fair. 44 Yu.R. Agachev, A.V. Savina L and Tr. T R A 1.
