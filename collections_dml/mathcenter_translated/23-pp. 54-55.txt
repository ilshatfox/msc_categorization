Locally free action of endless groups, let G - a group acting on an additively recorded Abel group V. They say that G acts freely on V if VG 6 = V for 0 6 = V ∈ V, 1 6 = G ∈ G. The known Tsassenhaus theorem gives the classification of the final groups that can act freely on the non -trivial abele group. In [1], this theorem was distributed from the final groups to groups in which any two conjugated elements of a simple order generate the final subgroup. Significant progress was achieved in [2], where it is proved that the periodic group generated by elements of about three and acting freely on the non -trivial Abel group is finite. The work [3] shows that the condition for frequency in this result can be loosened to the condition of the limb of the order of the switch of any two conjugated elements of the order 3. Finally, in [4] the result of [2] mentioned above is generalized when the condition of freedom of action is applied only On subgroups generated by two conjugated elements of a simple order. The next result significantly expands the class of the studied groups due to the weakening of the condition imposed on 2-sorrower subgroups. TEOREMA 1. Let G - a group acting exactly on the Abel group V. Suppose G is generated by such a class X of the conjugated elements of about 3 that any two elements X, Y from X are either double -halved, or generate a periodic subgroup acting freely on V. Then G is either a cyclic group of about 56 ka 3, or an extension of a group of about 2 by means of a skillful group A (i) substitutions of some (not necessarily final) set of I power, no less than 4. As follows from [3], the condition for the frequency of the subgroup 〈X, y〉 in theorem 1 can be replaced with the condition of the limb of the order of the switch [x, y]. The approval, the reverse theorem 1, is also true.

The ultimate goal of this work is to build a complete Kartanovsky continuation of the algebra L above the field K characteristics P = 2, 3 using a crawling display (see [1]). With other characteristics, the continuation breaks off with algebra type B3. In these theses, we indicate only the display π0 and π1. 57
