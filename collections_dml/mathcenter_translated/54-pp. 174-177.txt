UDC 517.956.25 On the establishment of solutions of anisotropic elliptical equations with variable non -linearities in R n A.Sh. Kamaletdinov1, L.M. Kozhevnikova2 1 kamaletdinovaleksandr@mail.ru; Sterlitamak branch of Bashkir State University, Faculty of Mathematics and Information Technologies 2 Kosul@mail.ru; Sterlitamak branch of Bashkir State University, Faculty of Mathematics and Information Technologies in the work considered a certain class of anisotropic elliptical equations of the second order of sabotage with variable non -linearities. In the space rn, n ≥ 2, the conditions for the permissibility of equations are studied. The existence of decisions without restrictions on the growth of input data at | x | → urb has been proven. Keywords: anisotropic elliptical equation, the existence of a solution, variable indicators, pseudo -monotonous operator. Anisotropic quasilinear elliptical equations of the second order are considered n∑ i = 1 (ai (x, u, ∇u)) XI −A0 (x, u, ∇u) = 0, x = (x1, x2, x2, xn) ∈Rn. (1) It is assumed that the functions AI (X, S0, S1,.., SN) have a degree growth according to alternating SI with indicators Pi (x) ∈ (1, ∞), I = 0.1,. . . , n. As the simplest example, the equation is n∑ i = 1 (| uxi | pi (x) −2uxi) XI - | u | p0 (x) −2u = n∑ i = 1 (φi (x)) xi −φ0 ( x). (2) In 1984, H. Breysis [1] on the example of the equation −∆u +| u | p0−2u = f (x), x ∈Rn, p0> 2, and its generalizations showed that there are elliptical equations in unlimited areas for which there are only solutions to the corresponding regional problems without assumptions for their behavior and the growth of input data at infinity. L. Boccardo, T. Galois, J. Vaztz in [2] proved the existence of a solution to the equation - n∑ i = 1 (| ∇u | p - 2UXI) XI +| u | p0- 2u = f (x), x ∈ Rn, A.Sh. Kamaletdinov, L.M. Kozhevnikova 175 without infinity conditions at P> 2–1/N, P0> P. In addition, the authors showed that the condition P0> P is necessary for the existence of a solution if no restrictions are superimposed on the growth of function F. G.I. Laptev in [3] studied the conditions for the existence of solutions of equations - n∑ i = 1 (ai (x, u, ∇u)) xα +a0 (x, u) = f (x), x ∈Rn, n ≥ 2. Functions ai (x, s0, s), i = 1 ,. . . , n, a0 (x, s0), f (x) can grow arbitrarily at | x | → ∞. These functions satisfy the generalized conditions of the theory of monotonous operators according to the arguments s0 ∈ R, s ∈ Rn. Functions AI (x, s0, s), i = 1 ,. . . , n, according to alternating s0 ∈ R, s ∈ Rn have a wall growth with indicators p - 1, p0 (p - 1)/p, respectively. Provided that n <p <p0, the theorem of the existence of a solution U ∈W 1 p, loc (rn) has been proved. L.M. Kozhevnikova and A.A. Haji in [4] for a certain class of anisotropic elliptical equations of the second order with unsteady non -linearies proved the existence theorem without restrictions on the growth of input data at | x | → ∞. M.M. Gokalo and E.V. Domanskaya in [5] investigated the regional tasks in unlimited areas for the class of elliptical anisotropic equations with variable indicators of non -linearities, a model example of which is equation (2). The correctness of the regional tasks is proved without restrictions on the behavior of decisions and conditions for the growth of initial data at infinity. It should be noted that in [4], [5], the existence of solutions of elliptical equations in unlimited areas with the relevant operators satisfying the condition of monotony is established. This work considers a wider class of elliptical anisotropic equations with variable indicators of non -linearities with the corresponding pseudo -moneted operators. The resolution of the equation (1) in the space RN is proved, no conditions for the behavior of solutions and the growth of input data at | x | → φ are not applied. First, we determine the space with variable indicators. Let q are an arbitrary area of ​​space RN. Denote C+ (q) = {p (x) ∈C (q): 1 <p - ≤ p+ <+ urb}, where P - = Inf q p (x), p+ = sup q p (x). Let p (x) ∈ C+(q), define the quinago space with a variable indicator LP (·) as many measurable on q materially significant functions V (x) such as: ρp (·), q (v) = ˆ q | v (x) | p (x) dx <mm, with the norm of Luxembourg ∥v∥p (·), q = ∥v∥lp (·) = Inf {k> 0 ∣∣∣∣ ρ ρ ρ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ (·), Q (V/K) ≤ 1}. We denote-→ p (x) = (p1 (x), p2 (x), ..., pn (x)) ∈ (c+(q)) n and put p+(x) = 176 materials of the Maxi International School-Conference = 1, n pi (x), x ∈ Q. The anisotropic space of Sobolev with variables h̊ 1- → p (·) (q) is defined as a replenishment of the space C mm 0 (q) according to the norm ∥v∥h̊ → p (·) (Q) = n∑ i = 1 ∥vxi ∥pi (·), q. The space h̊ 1- → P (·) (q) is a reflexive banakhov [6]. Significant importance in the resulting results is played by the investment theorem for the space H̊ 1 - → P (·) (q), established by H. Fan [6]. Let p (x) = n (n∑ i = 1 1/pi (x)) −1, p ∗ (x) = {np (x) n -p (x), p (x) <n, +φ , p (x) ≥ n, pinger (x) = max {p ∗ (x), p+(x)}. Investment theorem.
