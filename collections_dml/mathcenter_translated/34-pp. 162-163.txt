Affin vector fields of the direct work of projective-evcual spaces of the affinated connectedness of M. B. Morgun Penza Persian pedagogical pedagogical university in the work examine the structure of algebra Lee infinisia of male affinated transformations of a direct work about the telecommunication spaces of affinated coherence. In this work, the indexes take the following values: i, j,. . . = 1 ,. . . , n; α, β,. . . = n+ 1 ,. . . , n+m. Let (mn, 1∇) and (NM, 2∇)-projective-Euclidean about the wanderings of the affinity of non-zero curvature, that is, the coherence of 1∇ and 2∇ do not have twists, the tensors of Weil 1W and 2W are zero and 1r 6 = 0, 2R 6 = 0. In the standard way, we build a direct work of these spaces (Mn × Nm, ∇ = 1∇ × 2∇). We denote through g (mn × nm) the algebra whether infinitic surveys of this space. Recall that the vector field x ∈ G (mn × nm) is and only when lx∇ = 0. (1) in local coordinates, this equation is equivalent to a system of differential equations in private derivatives of the second order. The first series of conditions for the integration of this system is equivalent to the LXR = 0 equation, where R = (1R, 2R). Given the conditions of 1w = 0 and 2W = 0, from equality lxr = 0, we get the ratio RKLX I α = 0, RαβX λ J = 0. According to the condition of the projective-Euclidean and crooked tensors, 1R and 2R are non-zero. Therefore, the corresponding Tenzo 164 Ricci is also non -zero. Therefore, X Iα = 0, XλJ = 0. Since X I α = ∂αX I, XλJ = ∂JX λ, x I depend only on x1 ,. . . , xn, xλ - only from xn+1 ,. . . , xn+m, that is, x = (1x, 2x) where 1x, 2x are vector fields on MN and NM, respectively. The results obtained lead to the conclusion that the equation (1) of the space (Mn × Nm, ∇) is a system      l 1x 1∇ = 0, l 2x 2∇ = 0. Thus, the theorem has been proven.
