Distributions of the projective nro-significance P "(L-distribution). The task is given Distributions in the zero of zero and proven that P-distribution exists with arbitrariness R (N-R)+(N-M) (T-R) functions of the Arguments. With P-distribution: 11 in the first differential, 1st surroundings are naturally associated with 7Z1: P)-distribution, for which P-distribution is the basis [1]. The task is given in the 1-RO RECROM RECOMITION 7Z1: PJ distribution of the projective space of the RP and the theorem of the SUSHISS was proved. Normalization of Norden-Chakamazyan, Nordsna Timofeev and invariant equipment were found.
