Frames of Parseval in RN with the same norms of M. A. Lapshin Samara University, marijalapshina@rambler.ru A set of vectors {f} mi = 1 ⊂ rn is called the Frame Parseval if each f ∈ ​​Rn is fairly equal to m∑ i = 1 | <f, fi> | 2 = ‖f‖2. If ‖f1‖ = ‖f2‖ =. . . = ‖Fm‖, then ‖fi‖2 = n/m. Frames of Parseval with the same norms are of great interest for applied research. It is known [1] that for each M> n there is a framework of Parseval with the same norms, however, building such frames requires complex algorithm MOVs. The work shows simple ways to build a Parseval frames with the same norms for the next pairs: M = 3, N = 2; M = 4, n = 2; M = 5, n = 2, n = 3, n = 4; M = 6, N = 3. In the proposed algorithms, matrices of the dysflow of Fourier are used [2]. L and T R A T R A 1. CASAZZA P.G.
