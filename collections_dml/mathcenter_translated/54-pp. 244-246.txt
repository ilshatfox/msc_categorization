Alipova in this Paper We Consider Extremal Properties of Mappings with S-AVERAGED CHARACTERICI. Variation Method Is Developed and Successfully Applied for Solutions of Extremal Problems in Theory of Plane Quasiconformal Mappings. We Suggest to Apply This Classical Method to Solve Extremal Problems in the Class of Mappings with S-Averaged Characteristic.

UDC 517.518 On the uniform approximation of a multi-digit display, set by two segment functions, a polynomial vector-function A.V. Makarov1, S.I. Dudov2 1 Alexander-makarov93@yandex.ru; Saratov National Research State University. N.G. Chernyshevsky 2 dudovsi@info.sgu.ru; Saratov National Research State University. N.G. Chernyshevsky considers the task of uniform approximation of a multi-digit display, set by the Cartesian work of two segment functions, a polynomial vector-function. The formulated necessary and sufficient conditions for the decision are a generalization of the result of S.I. Zukhovitsky - M.G. Crane to approach a continuous vector function. Keywords: uniform approximation, multi-digit display, polynomial vector-function, subdifferendal. Let theφ (·): t → 2R2 - a multi -digit display specified on a limited closed set T ⊂ R, with the values ​​set in the form of: A.V. Makarov, S.I. Dudov 245 φ (t) = {x ∈ R2: x ∈ F (t) × g (t)}, where f (t) = [f1 (t), f2 (t)], g (t) = [g1 (t), g2 (t)] - segment functions set by the fissitive functions FI (t), gi (t), i = 1.2, and f1 (t) ≤ f2 (t), g1 (t) ≤ g2 (t) for all t ∈ T. The task is the task of max tgr max vear (t) ∥V −V (a, t) ∥ - → min a = (a1, a2) ∈R2n+2. (1) hereπn (a, t) = (pn (a1, t), pn (a2, t)) ∈ R2, where pn (ai, t) = a0i +a1i t +· · +ani t n is algebraic in Polish degree n, ai = (a0i, a1i,., ani) ∈ Rn+1 - vector of its coefficients, I = 1.2, ∥ · ∥ ∥ - Euclidean norm. Theorem 1. Task (1) is equivalent to the problem onic (a) ≡ max tgr {f (a1, t)+g (a2, t)} - ​​→ min a = (a1, a2) ∈R2n+2, (2 ) where f (a1, t) = max {(pn (a1, t) - f1 (t)) 2, (pn (a1, t) - f2 (t)) 2}, g (a2, t) = max = max {(Pn (a2, t) - g1 (t)) 2, (pn (a2, t) - g2 (t)) 2}. Functions F (A1, T) and G (A2, T) are convex and finite on RN+1 according to A1 and A2, respectively. In accordance with the subdifferendary calculus ([1, chap 1]), the formulas of their subdifferials can be expressed in the form of ∂a1f (a1, t) =   2 (pn (a1, t) - f1 (t)) (1, t,,.., t n), if ∣∣pn (a1, t) - f1 (t) ∣∣> ∣∣pn (a1, t) - f2 (t) ∣∣, 2 (pn (a1, t) - f2 (t)) (1, t,,,., T n), if ∣∣pn (a1, t) - f1 (t) ∣∣ <∣∣pn (a1, t) - f2 (t) ∣∣, 2 (pn (a1, t) - f1 (t)) [ - (1, t,,,,.., t n), (1, t,,,.., t n n n n. )], if ∣∣pn (a1, t) - f1 (t) ∣∣ = ∣∣pn (a1, t) - f2 (t) ∣∣; ∂a2g (a2, t) =   2 (pn (a2, t) - g1 (t)) (1, t,,,.., T n) if ∣∣pn (A2, t) - g1 (t) ∣∣> ∣∣pn (a2, t) - g2 (t) ∣∣, 2 (pn (a2, t) - g2 (t)) (1, t,,. ., t n), if ∣∣pn (a2, t) - g1 (t) ∣∣ <∣∣pn (a2, t) - g2 (t) ∣∣, 2 (pn (a2, t) - g1 ( t)) [ - (1, t,,,., t n), (1, t,,,, t n)]], if ∣∣pn (a2, t) - g1 (t) ∣∣ = ∣ ∣pn (a2, t) — G2 (t) ∣∣; Theorem 2. In order for the vector a ∗ = (a ∗ 1, a ∗ 2) ∈ R2n+2 is a solution to the problem (2), it is necessary and sufficient that max tgr (a ∗) {max v1] (A ∗ 1, t) <v1, a1>+ max v2] ∈ T: ∗ (A) = F (A1, T)+G (A2, T)}, <·, ·> - scalar work. Note that if f1 (t) ≡ f2 (t), g1 (t) ≡ g2 (t) for t ∈ T, then the theorem 2 follows a known criterion [2] for the task of uniform approximation of the vector-function of the polynomial vector-function in form A.N. Kolmogorova (in a two -dimensional case).
