UDC 514.763.85 On the accuracy of constants in the generalized inequality of macai for the stiffness of twisting L.I. Gafiyatullina1, R.G. Salakhudinov2 1 ligafiyatullina@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Comathematics and Mechanics named after N.I. Lobachevsky 2 rsalakhud@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky in this work using approaches from [3] proves a generalization of macai inequality for the stiffness of twisting in the classroom of convex areas. Keywords: Toughness of twisting, moments of the Euclidean region relative to the border, isperimetric inequalities, the function of the distance to the boundary of the region. L.I. Gafiyatullina, R.G. Salakhudinov 41 row of isoperimetric inequalities for the stiffness of torsion of single -link regions were obtained by polya and sego [2], Makai [1], Payne [4] and other mathematicians. Let G - a convex region on a plane with a hidden border and ρ (Z, G) - the distance from the point Z to the border ∂g region. The geometric functionality determined by the equality of IP (G): = ï ω ρ (Z, G) P DA is called the moment of the Euclidean region of the order p. In 1962, E. Makai received the following inequality p (G) ≤ 4I2 (G), fair for any convex region. The following theorem takes place. Letug - a convex region on the plane and p ≥ 2. ρ (g)) ρ (g) 3 3, where l (ρ (g)) is the length of the level of level ρ (z, g) located at a distance of ρ (G) from the border ∂g. Constants (p +1) (p +2)/3 and (p −1)/3 are the best of the possible. Literature 1. MAKAI E.
