The integral equation of the task of diffraction of the electromagnetic wave on the curved metal screen 1 Tumakov Kazan State University studied the task of Koshi for the Helmholtz equation in an unlimited area with a curved border. The integral equation of Fredgolm of the 1st genus was obtained, to which a flat task of diffraction of the electromagnetic wave on a curved metal screen is reduced. 1 The derivative of normal and private derivatives will establish the relationship between the derivative in normal to the schedule of the monotonous function Z = F (X) (in the two -dimensional case) and derivatives in the directions of the coordinate axes. As you know, the derivative of normal to the smooth curve of the function u (x, z) can always be expressed through its private derivatives. In [1], p. 72, it is shown that for a monotonously waning function ∂u ∂n = ∂u ∂x f ′ (x) ∆ (x) + ∂u ∂z 1 ∆ (x), (1) where ∆ (x) = √ 1 + (F ′ (x)) 2. We show that formula (1) is also preserved in the case of an increasing function F (x). Indeed, for the angle θ between the axis X and the tangent to the curve tan θ = f ′ (x). Then COS (NX) = COS (π 2 + θ) = - sin θ = √ 1 - cos2 θ = tan θ 1 + tan2 θ, 1 work was supported by the Fund of the Republic of Tatarstan 219 The integral equation of the task of diffraction. . . COS (NZ) = COS θ = 1 + Tan2 θ and formula (1) follows from the formula ∂u ∂n = ∂u ∂x cos (nx) + ∂u ∂z cos (NZ). 2 The task of the Koshi for the region with the curved border we consider the task of the Koshi for the Helmholtz equation with the material coefficient in the area of ​​Z> F (X). We build a solution to the equation ∂2u ∂x2 + ∂2u ∂z2 + k2u = 0, z> f (x), −ura <x < + urb, (2) satisfying the boundary conditions ∂u ∂n (x, f (x)) = a1 (x), u (x, f (x)) = a0 (x), −mm <x < +وged. (3) Complete the desired decision by zero to the entire plane and we will consider it as a distribution of slow growth from the Sobolevsky space H Loc1. 220 D.N. Tumakov Theorem 9. Distribution U (X, Z) is a solution to the problem of Koshi (2), (3) when and only when the boundary functions satisfy the conditions + ger −mm [a1 (x) √ 1 + (f ′ (x )) 2 + iacy0 (x) f ′ (x) - - --iγ0 (hole) a0 (x)] eiγ 0 (hole) f (x) + i ingx dx = 0, (4) where γ0 (ă) = {| ctor | ≥ k: +i √ nut2 - k2; | ctor | ≤ k: - √ k2 - oring}. At the same time, the image of Fourier U (ă, ζ) satisfies the equation U (ă, ζ) = 1 2π 1 k2 - ₽2 - ζ2 + و imes –ura [a1 (x) √ 1 + (f ′ (x)) 2+ + 2+ + iacy0 (x) f ′ (x) - iζa0 (x)] eiζf (x)+iising dx. (5) proof. We apply the double transformation of Fourier to the equation (2). Denote iz (ă, ζ) = 1 2π +و — et +ipp (x) ∂2u ∂z2 eiζzdz ei recordx. We convert the internal integral +φ (x) ∂2u ∂z2 eiζzdz = +ger∫ f (x) eiζzd [∂u ∂z] = = ∂u ∂z (x, f (x)) eiζf (x) - ζ +φ∫ f (x) eiζzdu = 221 Integral equation of the task of diffraction. . . = [–∂u ∂z (x, f (x)) + Iζu (x, f (x))] eiζf (x) - ζ2 + ger∫ f (x) u eiζzdz. Thus, iz (₽, ζ) = ζ2u (ă, ζ) + + 1 2π + φ∫ −mm [∂u ∂z (x, f (x)) + iζu (x, f (x)) ] eiζf (x)+iising dx. (6) Now consider the image of Fourier IX (₽, ζ) = 1 2π +φ∫ –ura ∑ k vk (z) ∫ wk (z) ∂2u ∂x2 eiunkdx eiζzdz, here WK (Z) is the area of ​​decrease of the function z = F (x), VK (Z) - the area of ​​increasing f (x), and k is the number of local extremum. Note that although the external integral in IX (X, Z) indicates endless limits, in fact, integration comes from min x f (x) to max x f (x). The internal integral, how is it easy to see, vk (z) ∫ wk (z) ∂2u ∂x2 eiunkdx = = [∂u ∂x (x, z) - iising (x, z)] eiunk ∣∣∣ x = vk (z ) x = wk (z) - oring vk (z) ∫ wk (z) u eiunkdx. Consider the expression r (₽, ζ) = +و −mber ∑ k [∂u ∂x (vk (z), z) e i tip (z) - ∂u ∂x (wk (z), z) e i standard ( z) - - --iising (vk (z), z) eiunk (z) + i inst (wk (z), z) eiunk (z)] eiζzdz. 222 D.N. Tumakov will replace variables VK (Z) = x, z = f (x), x ∈ ωRK in the first and third terms and wk (z) = x, x = f (x), x ∈ ωlk in the second and fourth terms, Here ωlk is an interval of decreasing function F (x) in the area of ​​the perreum, and ωrk is the interval of its increase. Note that ∪k (ωlk ∪ ω ωrk) = R. Then r (ă, ζ) = ∑ k  ∫ ∫ ωr k ∂u ∂x (x, f (x)) eiason+iζf (x) f ′ (x) f ′ ( x) dx++ ∫ ωl k ∂u ∂x (x, f (x)) eiason+ iζf (x) f ′ (x) dx - - --iaw ∫ ωr k u (x, f (x)) eiason (x ) f ′ (x) dx - - --i charge ∫ ωl k u (x, f (x)) eiason +iζf (x) f ′ (x) dx     = +nder∫ –ura ∂u ∂x (x, f (x)) f ′ (x) ei charge+iζf (x) dx - - --i charge+ger∫ –ura u (x, f (x)) f ′ (x) ei mill+iζf (x) dx. Thus, IX (₽, ζ) = –ran (perf, ζ) + 1 2π + و imes –ura [∂u ∂x (x, f (x)) - Iason (x, f (x))]]]]]] F ′ (x) ei charge+iζf (x) dx. (7) After the double transformation of the Fourier, taking into account (6), (7) and (1) we get (k2 - ctor2 - ζ2) u (ă, ζ) = 1 2π +و – et [∂u ∂n (x, f (x)) √ 1 + (f ′ (x) 2+ 223 Integral equation of the task of diffraction. . . +iising (x, f (x) f ′ (x) - ζu (x, f (x))] eiζf (x)+iising dx. The function u (ă, ζ) e --iζh (h = min x f (x)) should be analytically continued in the variable ζ into the upper half -plate. The waves coming from infinity should also be absent. We write the reverse transformation of the Fourier of the expression standing on the right side (5). Using the equality a - bζ k2 - onic2 - ζ2 = 1 2γ0 (perf) [bγ0 (₽) - a ζ - γ0 (ă) + bγ0 (ă) + a ζ + γ0 (ă)] we convert the integral + و —M Φ D (t,
