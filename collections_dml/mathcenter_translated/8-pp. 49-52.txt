) The transformation of the fourier -style of the singular functions 49 Let F (X), X ∈ [−1, 1], - continuous monotonous singular function and F (−1) = 0, f (1) = 1; F̂ (Z)-its transformation of Fursheltesa. It is well known that [1] ∫ r −r | F̂ (x) | 2 dx → ∞ with R → ∞. ∫ r −r | F̂ (x) | 2 dx = o (r). Our message pursues two goals: firstly, we offer a universal structure that generates a class of continuous singular monotonous functions with many growth points belonging to many type E organiz [−1, 1] with a constant ratio of breakdown Answers (0, 1 2) and , secondly, in the framework of the proposed design, we give two examples indicating the asymptotics of the divergence ∫ r --r | F̂ (x) | 2 dx. Consider ω = {ω: ω = (t1, ..., tn, ...), tn = ± 1} - many endless sequences. We introduce the structure of the Borelevsky space to ω, setting σ-algebra β, generated by a system of final-dimensional cylinders {cn (Δ1, ..., Δn)} و = 1, where cn (Δ1, ..., Δn) = {ω ∈ ω : ω = (Δ1, ..., Δn, tn + 1, ...), tk = ± 1, k = n + 1, ...}-N-dimensional cylinder with the base (Δ1, ..., ..., Δn) (see [2]). The probability p is determined by a set of end -measured probabilities {pn (t1, ..., tn), tk = ± 1, k = 1, ..., n} mmn = 1. Let now {xk (ω) = tk} ger = 1 - a set of coordinate functions in the probabilistic space (ω, β, p). We determine the function s: ω → [−1, 1] by means of a row (ω) = φ∑ k = 1 xk (ω) lection k, lection (0, 1 2). (1) properties f (x) = p {ω: s (ω) ≤ x} The distribution of the row (1) are essential on the properties of the final distribution {pn} mmn = 1, which determine the probability of. Theorem 1. The distribution function of the row (1) f (x) 1) is continuous and only when limn → ger pn (t1, ..., tn) = 0 for any ω = (t1, ..., tn, tn, tn, tn, tn, tn, tn, tn, tn, tn ...). 50 2) SP (F) ⊂ EM, and therefore F (X) is singular. This design allows you to present all the functions of interest to us; This confirms the following theorem 2. Let the function F (x) is continuous, f (x) = 0, x ≤ −1; F (x) = 1, x ≥ 1, f (x) does not decrease on [−1, 1] and SP (f) ⊂ EM, then there is such a probabilistic measure p that F (x) will be the function of distribution of a row (1 ) on (ω, β, p). Example 1. Let p ∈ (0, 1), determine the system {pn} inous = 1 in the following way: pn (t1, ..., tn) = n∏ k = 1 (1 - p) 1+tk 2 p 1–TK 2 (2) Then the function of distribution of a row (1) - a generalized function of the Lebeg. Example 2. Let p ∈ (0, 1), determine the system {pn} gerN = 1 in the following way: pn (t1, ..., tn) = 1 2 n - 1∏ k = 1 (1 - p) 1 +TKTK+1 2 P 1–TKTK+1 2 (3) Then the function of distribution of a row (1) - Markov's indignation of the generalized function of the Lebag. Theorem 3. Let f̂ (z) = ∫ 1 −1 e iztdf (t)-transformation of the fury-style of the distribution function of the row (1) in the probabilistic space determined by the ended distribution (2) or (3), then ∫ r --r | F̂ (x) | 2 dx ³ R1 --γ, γ = ln (α 2 + (1- α2)) ln 2.
