Napalkov Ufa, Aliya-0887@mail.ru about one class of differential equations 109 with polynomial coefficients of this work is the introduction of one class A of differential operators with a change in the mi coefficients and finding the necessary And enough conditions under which operators of this class can be reduced to differential operators in generalized about emails with constant coefficients of the type M r = ~ ckdk j (z). k = o Let p (z) - polynomial, d F - the operator of a generalized diffusation system (see [1], [2]), generated by the function of the type 00 k g (z) = 1 + {; p (l) p (2 ~ · · p (k) · (1) We introduce class A of differential operators with polyno ministry coefficients of the type Q lf = ~ pk (z) f (k) (z), k = o where PK (where z) - polynomial degree no higher than K.
