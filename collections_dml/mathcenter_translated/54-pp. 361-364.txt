Trukhlyaev1 1 Irishka2027@mail.ru; Volgograd State University of this work is reduced by assessing the value necessary to clarify the uniform convergence of close decisions of the minimum surface equation. Key words: the equation of the minimum surface, uniform convergence, close solution, approximation of the equation, assessment of uniform convergence. Consider the following polynomial characteristics of the region ω⊂ rn λn = Inf p (´ ω | ∇p | 2 d x) 1/2 p | ω | SUP ω | ∇P | Where the exact lower line is taken for all polynomials of the degree of no more than N for each variable. We give an example of assessment from below λn. It should be noted that this characteristic of the region is used in assessing the rate of convergence of polynomial solutions of the equation of minimum surfaces (see [1]). In the work [2], the following inequality λn ≥ 1 2n+1 p ωn 2n/2n n 4 p nn was obtained for the cube, (1) which made it possible to directly make the λn value for the areas ω, for which ∆ (ω)> 0, where ∆ (ω) = Inf z0ω a (z0) and a (z0) is determined as follows: for any Z0 ∈ PLAND, we find the maximum cube k (z0) ⊂ω, not necessarily with the aspects parallel to the coordinate axes, such that z0 ∈ K (Z0). Let A (z0) - side of this cube. It is obvious that there are areas with a piece-clatter of the border, for which te engine (ω) = 0. For example, for the cone C = {(x, y, z): x2 + y2 <1.0 <z <a (1– √ x2 + y2)} with accurately large a> 0 value ∆ (c) = 0. 362 Materials of the International School-Conference So, let the R3 space with the decartial coordinates (x, y, z) Cub Kub Kube at the peaks at points ( 0.0.0), (h, 0.0), (0, h, 0), (h, h, 0), (0.0, h), (0, h, h), (h, 0, h), (0, h, h), where α ∈ (0, π/2], h> 0. Using a linear transformation u = x + y cosα + z sinβ, v = y sinα, t = z Cosβ in space with coordinates (u, v, t) we get a parallelepiped R (see Fig. 1) with peaks (0.0.0), (h cosα, h sinα, 0), (h +h cosα, h sinα 0), (h, 0.0), (h sinβ, 0, h cosβ), (h cosα+h sinα, h sinα, h cosβ), (h+h cosα+h sinα, h cosβ ), (h+h sinβ, 0, h cosβ). Fig. 1. Parallelepiped R Let now p = p (x, y, z) - arbitrary polynomial, the degree of which for each variable does not exceed n. We will consider the case when α = π/2-β. It is easy to notice that p 2u +p 2v +p 2y ≥ p 2x +p 2y +p 2z ≥ min {1 +2sin2β 1 +4sin2β, COS2β 2 +4SIN2β} (P 2U +P 2V +P 2T). Then (ð r (p 2x +p 2y +p 2z) d xd yd z) 1/2 p | k | max r | ∇p | ≥ I.V. Trukhlyaeva 363 ≥ Cosβp 2 √ 1 +2sin2β · (ð k (p 2u +p 2v +p 2t) dud vd t) 1/2 · cosβ p | r | max k | ∇p | = = cosβp 2 √ 1 +2sin2β · (ð k (p 2u +p 2v +p 2t) dud vd t) 1/2 · cosβ p | k | max k | ∇p | √ | k | | R | = = cosβp 2 √ 1 +2sin2β (ð k (p 2u +p 2v +p 2t) dud vd t) 1/2 p | k | max k | ∇p | ≥ cosβ ed 1+2sin2β P π 96 4 p 3n 3. Thus, for the parallelepiped with the side of H> 0, and the acute angle β ∈ (0, π/2] the inequality λn ≥ cosβ√ 1+2sin2β √ πsin2β 96 4 p 3n 3 is performed. Let the arbitrary area ω ∈ R3 is now set. Suppose. Suppose that there is such a number β (ω) ∈ (0, π/2], that any point Z0 is contained in a certain parallelepiped R ⊂ω with an acute angle β (ω). At this, Z0 does not have to be the center of the cube r. Any Z0 ∈ ω We find the maximum on the side of the cube r ⊂ ω such that z0 ∈ D. Let the side of this parallelepiped h (z0)> 0. We assume that h (ω) = Inf z0ω h (z0)> 0. Reasoning in the same way as in [1], we will receive inequality the following statement: theorem. Let the limited area ω ⊂ r3 such that h (ω)> 0 and β (ω)> 0. Then the following assessment is λn ≥ √ π | Ω | h (ω) cosβ 96 4 p 3n 3 √ 1+2sin2β. Literature 1. Klyachin A.A., Trukhlyaeva I. V.O.
