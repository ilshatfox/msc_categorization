Achi for differential equations and their connection with the reverse tasks in the report sets out the results on the resolving of ill -tank margins for some classes of equations with private derivatives - hyperbolic, parabolic, pseudo of parabolic and pseudo -parapabolic equations, equations of the constituent type, equations with multiple characteristics. The tasks are considered with the task as non -quarrel conditions - for example, conditions and (x, o) = foi + IO (x) or, accordingly, with linear operators of the PO and F1, and the conditions that are non -spatial variables. For all tasks under consideration, theorems of the existence and uniqueness of regular decisions are proved. The so -called tents for equations with private derivatives are closely connected with non -cabal tasks - for cottages, in which unknown, along with the solution, are the coefficients of the equation, or the right part. The existence of regular solutions of a number of new such problems is also proved by the author; The basis for such results is the corresponding results of the author about the resolving of non -valuable tasks.
