. Gorina for the individual worst fractions of V.I. Danchenko1, P.V. Chunaev2 1 vdanch2012@yandex.ru; Vladimir State University. A.G. and N.G. Stock 2 chunayev@mail.ru; Vladimir State University. A.G. and N.G. Stock and St. Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics (ITMO University), a note was assessed from the bottom of the modules of imaginary parts of the poles of the logarithmic derivative of algebraic polynomial (the smallest fraction), subject to its standardization on the actual axis. Unlike previous results, the assessment takes into account the value of deductions in the poles. Keywords: Gorin's task, the smallest fraction, the smallest evasion. In [1], E. A. Gorin set the task of assessing from the bottom of the value DN (r, p) = Inf {y (ρn): ∥ρn∥lp (r) ≤ 1}, y (ρn): = min K = Min K = 1, ..., m | Im zk |, 1 <p ≤ least, where ρn (z): = (ln m∏ k = 1 (z - zk) nk) ′ = m∑ k = 1 nk z - zk (1) There is the smallest shot - the logarithmic derivative of the algebraic polynomial Q (Z) = ∏m k = 1 (z - zk) NK a given degree n = ∑m k = 1 nk. With p = ∞ (this is the most difficult case), the task was considered in the works [1] - [6]. The final result on the class of all the most common fractions of the species (1) was obtained in [6]: DN (R, ∞) ≍ lnlnn LNN. (2) There it is also shown that with the final P, the values ​​DN (R, P) are not waned to zero and limited from below a positive value that depends only on p. Later, analogues of Gorin’s tasks on other sets were considered (half -straight, rectilinear segments, circles, hidden compacts, etc.) and with various norms of fractions (1). Details the history of questions and the results of different authors in this direction are set out in [7]. The estimated value can be rewritten as follows: DN (r, p) = Inf ρn {y (ρn) ∥ρn∥qlp (r)}, p - 1 +q - 1 = 1, where the infinum is taken in all fractions of the species (1), Those who do not have poles on R. Consequently, Gorin’s task can be reformed as the task of the smallest evasion of zero in lp (r) in the fraction class (1) subject to y (ρn) = 1, or, provided, provided, provided that all the fractions (1) have a common fixed pole, for example, Z1 = I. This circumstance, in particular, leads to significantly more general tasks of approximation by fractions (1) on R and on other sets, so that the task of Gorina has not lost its relevance (see [7]). 132 Materials of the School-Conference Bilateral Evaluation (2) is fair in the class of all fractions of the type (1) excluding the multiples of zeros of the polynomial Q. The question arises of evaluating Y (ρn) for the individual normalized smallest fraction ρn taking into account the values ​​of NK. The theorem has been received. With some absolute constant C for the ZK pole, we have | IM zk | ≥ C (lnn) 1/nk +1 (lnn) 1/nk −1 · lnlnn lnn> 2c nk lnn, n ≥ 4. (3) the second inequality is an elementary assessment of the first fraction. Thus, we have a continuous scale of additional factors in (2). For example, if nk ≤ lnlnn, then in (3) we get the assessment order as B (2): | Im zk | > 2C lnlnn/lnn, and with NK, satisfying the opposite inequality, in (3) the inequality is obtained | IM zk | ≥ 2C NK LNN, more accurate in order than (2). The work was carried out with financial support for the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia (Task 1.574.2016/1.4) and the RFFI (project 18-01-00744). Literature 1. Gorin E. A.
