) The presentation of the resolvent of the discrete recovery equation is considered the system n xn = l an-kxk + fn · k = o 168 (1) are clarified the conditions under which the nucleus {rn} is true for resolvent {rn} is the idea of ​​p rn = IA1) + bn + l BN -KLFK2), K = O where {VP} is some known to the Followed, and {III)} E L1. In the scalar case, the sequence {bn} is determined by 00 with zeros of function 1 - e anzn, where lzl ~ 1, and in the matrix - HAP = O 00 -1 with a racster of special points (1 - I: Anzn). In addition, in SKA.LARN = about the same case, the situation with zeros is not a whole multiplicity, namely, if L 1 = E; ",, ..., lk = e '" k, lk+i, ...,, ..., LT - zeros 1 00 2 :: anzn at [z 1 ~ 1 multiplicity m1 +a1, ..., mk +ak, mk +1, ..., mt n = o, respectively, where mj ~ o whole, o: o: o: o: o: o: o: o: o: o: o: o: o: o j e (o, 1),./'j e [o, 2p), and m 1 = ... = mk = p = max mj, then I> .31 = 1 k () (n) t in ~ -inl '· o: j + n -1 n () ~ n ()' -n n = l_, e 3 1 g n + l __, 'm; -1 n lj. j = l p. J = l here PR (n)-polynomial degrees R, and n (m) = n (n-1) ... (n-m+l) with p e z, t e n, p [o] = 1. In the matrix situation, the problem is solved in the case when special 00 -1 points of function (j - e anzn) - pole. For the case of an ~ n = o o, n ~ o ~ south, some results are also for special points of vi da z- "'', and e (o, 1). Found presented: 1 razolventi is also itchy to obtain the solutions {xn} Equation (1) according to the given Taylor decomposition of free penny into {f p} in the vicinity of an infinitely removed point. 169
