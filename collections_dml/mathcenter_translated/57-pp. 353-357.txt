. Affinmeal of measures with the application to the holomorphic functions of B.N. Khabibullin, E.B. Menshikova let U ̸≡ − − least and M ̸≡ − least two subharmonic functions in the area D of the complex plane C. We explore two related ones. But various tasks. The first consists in finding the conditions for ris's measures, vu and µm functions U and M, respectively, when performing which there is a subharmonic function H ̸≡ − least in D such that U +H <m. The second is that the desired function H should be harmonious in D. The answers to these questions are given in terms of special affinity of the measures introduced in our previous works. The applications of this technique relate to the description of the distribution of zeros of the holomorphic functions f in D, which satisfy the limitation | F | ≤ Exp m. Key words: subharmonic function, measure of risa, sweeping, holomorphic function, sequence of zeros, many uniqueness, weight class. UDC 517.956.6 On the periodic task for the equation of a mixed type of the second kind R.S. Khairullin1 1 xravil@kgasu.ru; Kazan State Architectural and Construction University for an equation of a mixed type of second kind has a task in a rectangular area. On the sides of the rectangle, the condition of frequency is given, on the basis of the value of the desired function. On a special line, the conditions of gluing are determined. The solution to the problem is built in the form of a summary. Sufficient conditions were found for the given functions and geometry of the region, ensuring the existence of a solution. The criterion of uniqueness has been established. Key words: strong degeneration, an equation of the second kind, a periodic task. In [1] K.B. Sabitov for the mixed type equation was considered the task of the conductor in the rectangular area. To study it, a certain analogue of the Fourier method was proposed. This method was later used in solving other problems, including tasks with the condition of frequency [2.3]. The purpose of our research is to adapt the this method to equations with strong degeneration, in particular, articles [4-6] are devoted to the study of the task of the conductor for the UXX + yuy y + αuy = 0, α≤-1/2, (1) 354 school materials. Conferences in the mixed area ω = {(x, y): 0 <x <1, - –β <y <γ}, where β> 0 and γ> 0. In this work for the equation (1), the task is considered with the condition of the periodicity On the side sides ω. Through n and m, we denote natural numbers that satisfy the inequalities −1/2 <α+n = α0 ≤ 1/2, 1 <2α+m ≤ 2. It is obvious that m = 2n +2 ​​at −1/2 <α0 ≤ 0 and m = 2n +1 at 0 <α0 ≤ 1/2. Let ω1 = ω∩ {y> 0}, ω2 = ω∩ {y <0}. The task is pα. In the area ω, find the function u (x, y) with the properties: 10 u (x, y) ∈C 2 (ω1 ∪ω2) and satisfies the equation (1) in ω1 ∪ω2; 20 There are limits from the regions ((x, y) ∈ωi, i = 1.2) τi (x) = lim y → 0 u (x, y), νi (x) = lim y → 0 | y | α [ u (x, y) - aα (x, y, τi)] y, (2) where aα (x, y, τi) = [m/2] ∑ s = 1 τ (2s) i (x) ( - - - - - - - - 1) S (α) s! y s, α ̸ = −n, aα (x, y, τi) = n∑ S = 1 τ (2s) i (x) ( - 1) S (α) S S! y s - τ (2n +2) i (x) n!

Let λk, xk (x) and yk (x) are determined by equalities (6) - (11). Then the functions uk (x, y) = xk (x) · [ck · yk, 1 (y)+dk · yk, 2 (y)], where ck, dk are arbitrary constant, are equation solutions (1), satisfying conditions (2) - (5).
