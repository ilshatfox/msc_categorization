) Mixed rows according to the Makesner polynomas and the approximative properties of mixed rows according to Polyno are explored:-. RAM L \ 1EIXNER. Through m ~ (x, q), where a> -1, o <q <1, we denote the Makesner polynomes, orthogonal with ne () x g (x+o+l) Â° '() catfish p x, a, q = q g (x+l), mn x, q - orthonomated according to.1 -anoms l \ 1 -shaxner, 1 2, p - the space of discrete functions 67 d = d (x) determined on the grid p = {0.1.2, .
