AKSENTEV in the Direct Problems We Know A Domain D and Find The Gradient of the Potential Inside Outside of this Domain. In the inverse problems we know the gradient of the potential near infinity and find a domain D. Also we consider direct and inverse problems for the gradient of the logarithmic potential of the simple layer with different types of the contours and new class of the gradient functions .

Avhadiev1 1 avkhadiev47@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University We define special functionality as accurate constants in integrated inequalities for trial functions set in areas on the plane. Analogs and generalizations of the classic result of F. RELLIH was obtained for a two -dimensional case, when additional conditions are required for the factors of Fourier of the trial function. Keywords: Relkh inequality, conformal display, evenly perfect set. The areas ω ⊂ c, ω ̸ = C. Let DIST (Z, ∂ω) - the distance from the point z = x + i y ∈ ω to the boundary of the region. Through Cux (ω) we denote many smooth integrated functions that have compact media in the area ̸ = c. In many works, the following variational inequality of the type of relechï ω | ∆ f (z) | 2 (Dist (Z, ∂ω)) - 2+2N D X D Y ≥ C2N (ω) ï ω | f (z) | 2 (Dist (Z, ∂ω)) 2 + 2N D X D Y ∀ F ∈C root (ω), (1) 28 Materials of the International School-Conference where Z = X + I Y ∈, Operator-Operator Laplace, n is a fixed material number, constant C2N (ω) ∈ [0, φ) is supposed to be the largest possible, i.e. It is determined by the formula C2N (ω) = Inf f ∈Cicle (ω), F ̸≡0 î ω | ∆ F (Z) | 2 (DIST (Z, ∂ω)) 2–2ND X D Yffic | F (Z) | 2 (DIST (Z, ∂ω)) - 2–2ND X D Y. Note that C2N (ω) is an invariant of linear conformal transformations, i.e. C2N (ω) = C2N (Aω+B), where Aω+B = {W ∈C: W = AZ+B, Z SERPA}, A, B ERN, A ̸ = 0. Inequality (1) is well studied For the case when the area = c \ {0} and, obviously, Dist (z, ∂ (c \ {0})) = | z |. In particular, F. Rellich proved (see [1]) that C21 (C \ {0}) = 0, but for any function F ∈Cicle (C {0}), satisfying the condition 2π 0 F ( r eiθ) sinθdθ = ˆ 2π 0 f (r eiθ) cosθdθ = 0 (∀r ∈ (0, urb)), the inequality c | ∆ f (z) | 2 d x d y ≥ ï c | is fairly valid. f (z) | 2 | z | 4 d x d y with an exact constant 1 instead of C21 (c \ {0}) = 0. In addition, in the article [2] P. Kaldiroli and R. Musin proved that c2n (C \ { 0}) = 0 for any whole number n. We complement these results with the following statement. Theorem 1. Let n ∈Z, and let the function F ∈Cicle (C \ {0}) satisfies the condition 2π 0 f (r eiθ) sinnθdθ = ˆ 2π 0 f (r eiθ) cosnθdθ = 0 (∀r ∈ ( 0, ∞)). Then the inequality c | ∆ f (z) | 2 d x d y | z | −2+2n ≥ (2 | n | −1) 2 ï c | f (z) | 2 d x d y | z | 2+2n. (2) constant (2 | n | −1) 2 is accurate, i.e. The maximum possible in inequality (2) for the specified class of functions. Suppose now that the ω⊂c region has at least two boundary components. Through M (ω), we denote the exact upper boundary of the conformal modules of the double areas lying in the ω and dividing the border ω. If the area ω is single -consuming and ω ̸ = c, then we believe m (ω) = 0 by definition. Obviously, 0 ≤ m (ω) ≤ear and m (c \ {0}) = inous. We also note that the area with the final maximum module M (ω) has a uniformly perfect border. The opposite statement is also true. A number of examples of such areas and non -trivial criteria of the limb M (ω) can be found in the works [3] and [4]. In the monograph [5], published in 2015, the reader can find basic results on inequalities such as Hardy and Rellykh with complete evidence. Several statements about the functionals C20 (ω) and C21 (ω) were obtained in 2016. In particular, in [6] it is proved that C20 (ω)> 0 ⇐⇒ C21 (ω)> 0 ⇐⇒ M (ω) <mm. Yu.R. Agachev, A.F. Galimyanov 29 seems likely that this result can be extended to the functionality of C2N (ω) for arbitrary n ∈Z. But to date, it has been possible to confirm this hypothesis only partially. Namely, we have proved the following statement. Theorem 2. Let n ∈Z, and let ω⊂c - an area with the maximum module m (ω). If m (ω) = و, then c2n (ω) = 0.
