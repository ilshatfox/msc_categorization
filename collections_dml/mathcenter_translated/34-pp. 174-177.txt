. Refined resonances in the system of two weakly tied nonlinear oscillators A.V. Potapov Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky Consider the system of two weakly tied nonlinear OS of the cyllets ẍ1+x1+µ1x 2 1+x 3 1 = ε (x2+Δẋ1), ẍ2+x2+µ2x 2+x 3 2 = εx1, (1) 176 which is which which In the transition to the altitude “action-contribution”, the type ̇1 = ε (x2 (i2, θ2) + δω1 (i1) x1 θ1 (i1, θ1)) x1 ′ θ1 (θ1, θ1), ̇2 = εx1 (i1, ε1, ε1 (i1, ε1, θ1) will take θ1) x2 ′ θ2 (i2, θ2), θ̇1 = ω1 (i1) + ε (−x2 (i2, θ2) + δω1 (i1) x1′ 11 (θ1)) x1 ′ ′ ′ iod (i1, θ1)) , θ̇2 = ω2 (i2) + ε (−x1 (i1, θ1) x2′i2 (i2, θ2)), (2) where slow variables I1 and I2 are changed in some naughty limited area ∆ ⊂ R2; (θ1, θ2) (Mod2π) - fast angular variables running two -dimensional TOR T 2; ω1 (i1), ω2 (i2) - frequencies of unrelated oscillators. Determination 1. We will say that in the system (1) there is a resonance (p: q), if the condition of the frequency rhinosity is fulfilled: ω1 (i1)/ω2 (i2) = q/p ∈ Q. Expression ω1 (i1)/ ω2 (i2) = q/p is determined on the plane (I1, I2) a resonance curve. We select the point on it (i1pq, i2pq). Determination 2. We will say that in the system (2) at the point (i1pq, i2pq) there is a degraded resonance of the first order, if the condition ω ′ 1 (i1pq) = = ω2 (i2pq) = 0, is fulfilled at this point. And at least one of the second derivatives from the personal from zero. Periods τ (h1.2) traffic along a closed phase curve ẋ21.2/2 + x 2 1.2/2 + µ1.2x 3 1.2/3 + x 4 1.2/4 = h1.2 uninocked oscillators ( ε = 0) are non -monotonons of functions at µ1.2 ∈ (0, 2). In this case, in the system (2), degenerated resonances of the 1st order may exist. Periodic solutions of the unperturbed system (ε = 0) are expressed through elliptical functions. In the work [1] it was shown that in the case of the degree of the 1st along the row in the vicinity of the degenerate resonance system (2) (from 177 accuracy to members of the order O (ε)), it can be led to the type U̇1 = ε 2/3a10 (i1pq, I2pq, ∗), u̇2 = ε 2/3a20 (i1pq, i2pq, ∗), ∗ = ε2/3 (ω1 ′ ω2 u21 + 2ω1ω2 ′ ω32 u22), (3) where a10 (ship) = 1 2πp ∫ 2πp 0 (x2 (i2pq, θ2) + δω1x1 ′ θ1 (i1pq, ∗ + q p θ2)) x1 ′ θ1 (i1pq, ∗ + q p θ2) dθ2, a20 (ship) = 1 2πp ∫ 2πp 0 x1 (i1pqq, ∗+ q p θ2) x2 ′ θ2 (i2pq, θ2)) dθ2. In dodium expressions, it is necessary to substitute calm decisions. The purpose of this work was the calculation of the AK0, K = 1, 2, and the study of the system (3). Due to the complexity of calculating the functions AK0 (ffic), the case of small µ1.2 is considered. Periodic solutions of the unperturbed system in this case can be represented in a simpler form. It is shown that the system (3) accepts the type U̇1 = ε 2/3 (b11 sin (p connect) +b12 cos (piron) +Δb10), u̇2 = ε 2/3 (b21 sin (p connect) +b22 cos (puty)) , ∗ = ε2/3 (ω1 ′ ′ ω2 u21 + 2ω1ω2 ′ ω32 u22), (4) where Bij = const. The species of the species (4) is considered in [3]. The basic attention in this work is paid to the study of the behavior of phase curves depending on the δ parameter.

Model of a gradient continuum obtained from the discrete microstructure of Yu. M. Prokhorov Nizhny Novgorod branch of the Institute of Machine Studies named after A.A. Blagonravova RAS, Nizhny Novgorod, pum2000@front.ru In the last decade, when modeling mechanical processes in structurally heterogeneous materials, gradient models are widely used, the first theory for which was built by Mindlin in 1964. In particular, the theory of grade continuums is used to describe dispersion waves in heterogeneous materials. Such a dispersion can be accurately described using a homogeneous gradient of the Non Continuum. However, in order to get an acceptable precision 179
