The boundary tasks for the Lyuville equation 125 can be considered a continuation of the study from [1], where the main point is the construction in the field D = {o <x <a, o <b} solution of the problem of gurs for their equalism = kexpu, k = Const> about. (1) The specified result out of 11) is applied to two tasks in the triangular region G, obtained from D by cutting off its part lying above direct a + bh = aus. Lying on this straight part of the border of the region G. Denisters 1.

Task 2 is to take off the funv; AI and E C (G) n NC01 (G U d) N C11 (G), also. In the Equation (1), but instead of (2) a set u (o, y) = v (y), Iulg = n (y), ue [o, b]. In a homogeneous setting (m = µ = o, n = v =: o) both tasks are insoluble. The perceptivity of heterogeneous tasks is associated with the fulfillment of the requirements: 1) m E C 1 [0, a], µ E C2 [0, A], M> µ ', M 2 -(µ') 2> 2 (m'-µ "), x e [o, a); 2) m (a) = µ '(a.), a [t' (a) - µ" (a)]+ bkexpµ (a) = o; 126 and.

When solving this problem, the inherent and sufficient conditions are indicated that ensure that for the differential form of the first order, the existence of the function I (x) (integrating the multiplier) is that the form I (x) W (x) is closed. This task finds applications in a number of sections of mathematics and in theoretical physics [2j.
