The ratio of Tits on the border of the space of incompatible curvature according to Buzeman K. V. Churkin Pomeranian State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, G. Arkhangelsk (X, D) is a local compact space of incompatible curvature in the sense of Buzeman, the compacting of which XH and XG coincides. This means that the identical reflection X on itself continues to the homeomorphism of compacting. In the case of CAT (0)-spaceship, the ∂icles border has the so-called corner metric, which gives rise to the metrics of TITS TD as the corresponding internal metric (see [1]). We introduce a set of ratios on the border ∂icles, which serves as an analogue of the Titsa metric in the case we are considering. Determination 1. Let ₽, η ∈ ∂gx and a, b: r+ → x - rays with the beginning X0, which are in directions of points cil and η, respectively. We will say that the points me and η form an angle of less than π, and write ∠ (₽, η) <π, if Δx0 (ă, η) = lim t →+urb (a (t), b (t)) 2t <1. (1) Otherwise, we will say that the angle between hole and η is π, and write ∠ (₽, η) = π. The execution of inequality (1) does not depend on the choice of point X0 = A (0) = B (0). For arbitrary infinitely removed points ctor, η ∈ ∂gx we assume that 1. TD (cil, η) <π, if ∠ (ă, η) <π; 2. TD (cil, η) ≤ π, if for any of their surroundings u (ă) and v (η) 172
