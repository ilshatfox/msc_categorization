) The weak sequenced completeness of one factor spaces in the space of integrated operators, let the accurate normal semi -endless trace of τm, and n - its gaggogra of the neumann, are highlighted on the algebra of the Neuman. Suppose that the trace τn is the restriction of τm on N is also semi -confusing. We denote through L1 (τm) and l1 (τn) the space of operators integrated relative to τm and τn, respectively, and through K (τm) and K (τn) - the corresponding spaces of completely measurable operators. The set of sets: k (², δ, p) = {x ∈ K (τm) | ∃q ∈ MPR (q ≤ p, ‖qxq‖ ² ², τ (p -q) ≤ δ)}, where ², Δ> 0, p ∈ MPR, τ (p) <و, forms the basis of zero surrendering to separate the topology in K (τm), consistent with the linear structure. We will call this topology a local convergence topology as they. Theorem 1 [3]. Let X - such a subspace L1 (τm) that a single ball X is closed in the topology of local convergence as they. Then the factor space L1 (τm)/x is poorly sequenced. The proof of this theorem in the main features is transferred from the work of Godfrois [1], which discusses the switching L1 spaces, only instead of the theorems of Bukhukhovalov -Lozanovsky used there, its inconsistent version of [2] is used. Theorem 2. Factor Space L1 (τm)/l1 (τn) is poorly sequenced. Theorem 2 immediately follows from theorem 1, if you notice that a single ball of space L1 (τn) is closed to K (τm) in the topology of local convergence as they. For the case of the final trace, this fact follows from the fullness of the space K (τn) in the topology of convergence as they. In general, the proof of OPI is 206 on the version of the Fatu theorem from [2], the previous case and the continuity of conditional expectation as a display from L1 (τm) with σ (l1 (τm), m) -topology in l1 (τn) with σ ( L1 (τn), n) -topology.

Skvortsov (Moscow) On variation measures in the theory of integral Henstoka method in the theory of integral allows you to describe a wide class of generalized integrals in terms of variation, regarding this differential basis generated by the function of the interval. In Henstok theory, the differential basis B is defined as a family filtering to include {β} of the subset of the Descartes work J × Rn, where J is a lot of intervals in RN. For the function of the interval wor, for each element β Basis B and for the set E ⊂ rn, the β-version of the function wor on e: var (β, onic, e) = sup ∑ | onic (i) | where the amount is distributed to the set of non-disclosure is determined intervals I, for which (i, x) ∈ β and x ∈ E, and SUP is taken in all 207
