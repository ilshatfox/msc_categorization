) The approximation properties of the weight exhibits in the LP spaces in the line and on the half -rejection in the articles of R. Zalika (1978), B. Fax (1981), the author (1984) contains both sufficient and necessary conditions for the completeness of E --iλnt · Exp systems ( −A | t | α), λn ∈ λ, a> 0, α> 1, (1) in space l2 = l2 (r). However, all full systems found in these works (1) are not minimal. The first example of a complete and at the same time minimum system (1) in L2 was indicated by R. Zalik and A. T. Saad in 1987 for the case α = 2. T. A. Salnikova (1995) already presented a whole class of complete and minimum systems (1 ) in L2, but again at α = 2. Author (1998), wide classes of full and minimum systems (1) in lp = lp (r), p ≥ 2 were built, already for all α> 1. 201 recently by the author Received: a) the necessary condition for the completeness and minimum of the system (1) in LP, 1 ≤ p <mm, b) a necessary condition for the uniform minimum of the full and minimum system (1) in LP, 1 ≤ P <∞. Condition a) consists in the existence of (the so -called threshold of giving) a whole function f (z) of order β = α/(α - 1), the many roots of which coincide with λ, and such that its indicator HF (θ) ≤ k (β , a) | sin θ | β, and each segment of the length of π/β contains at least one point at which the equal sign takes place. (K (β, a) - obvious constant.) Provided to normalize f (µ) = 1, µ /∈ λ This function is the only one. If the generating function has quite regular growth, then the condition b) is as follows: hf (θ) ≡ k (β, a) | sin θ | β. Using the last result, it is proved that all the systems full and minimal in the LP (1) of the above work are not evenly minimal. Similar results were obtained for LP (R+) spaces. The work was supported by the Russian Federation (project 00-01-00396). MV Selina (Samara) One regional task in an unlimited area we consider the equation l (u) ≡ uxy + α y - xuy = 0, (1) where 0 <α <1, in the area ga = {(x, y) | 0 <a <x <y < +φ}. Task.
