"Lobachev Readings - 2019" 7 UDC 514.822 Inequalities such as Hardy in open sets with a convex addition to F.G. Avhadiev1, R.V. Makarov2 1 avkhadiev47@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky 2 ruva2007@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky in the article proves new integral inequalities for truly significant functions in the subset of the Euclidean space. We assume that an addition is a non -empty convex set. The expansion of the hadviger theorem of the approximation of convex sets is proved by polygons to obtain some generalizations and improvements of multidimensional inequalities such as hardy. Keywords: Hardy’s inequality, convex compact set, accurate constant in this work, open sets ω rn are considered that n ≥ 2 and k: = rn \ ω is a non -empty convex set. In other words, any area considered below is a lot with a convex addition. And we consider the inequality of the Hardy type on these sets, except for the theorem where we consider open sets with a compact addition that can be a non -fuel. There are a large number of works on multidimensional inequalities such as Hardy. The reader can get acquainted with the basic results in the works [2], [3]. It is worth noting that there are close inequalities such as reellich associated with inequalities such as Hardy. Let Dist (x, ∂ω) - this is the distance from the point x € to the boundary of the region. And C 10 (ω) - a family of smooth material functions with compact media. We will consider the inequality, with parameters p ∈ [1, φ) and s ∈ (− least, φ): ∫ ω | ∇u (x) | p d x dists --p (x, ∂ω) ≥ cnps (ω) ∫ ω ∫ ω | u (x) | p d x dysts (x, ∂ω) ∀u ∈C 10 (ω), where ∇u denotes the gradient of the function u: ω → R, with CNPS (ω) constant [0, urb), which is as possible, that is, it is determined by the following formula: cnps (ω) = Inf u] 10 (ω), u ̸≡0 ∫ ω | ∇u (x) | p d x dyers -p (x, ∂ω) d x /∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ Ω | u (x) | p d x dysts (x, ∂ω). It is worth noting that CNPS (ω) is an invariant relative to linear transformations, that is: CNPS (ω) = CNPS (Aω+B), where Aω+B = {Y ∈ RN: Y = AX+B, X ∈ ON} C C a fixed point b ∈ Rn and a fixed number a ̸ = 0. 8 “Lobachev readings - 2019” in this work, we distribute the hawiger theorem (see [1]) about the approximation of convex bodies in case of unlimited convex sets. These generalizations, as well as methods from work [2], [3] are used in evidence of the following statements. Theorem 1. Suppose that n ≥ 2 andω⊂arn is a lot that rn \ ω is a non -empty convex set. Then, for any p ∈ [1, φ) and any S ∈ (− least, φ) is true the following: cnps (ω) ≥ min {s −k | p /pp: k = 1.2, ..., n } Theorem 2. Suppose that n ≥ 2 and ω ⊂ rn is an open area that rn \ ω is a non -empty compact set. Then, for any p ∈ [1, φ) and any S ∈ [n, φ) the ratio is true: CNPS (ω) = p --P | S −n | p. Theorem. 3 For any S ∈ R, the following ratio is true: ï R2 | ∇U (Z) | 2 R S -2 D XD Y ≥ | S −2 | 2 4 ï R2 u2 (z) r d xd y + ï r2 (u (z) - 1 2π ∫ 2π 0 u (r ei t) d t) 2 d xd y r s ∀u ∈C 10 (r 2 \}) where r = | z |, z = x + i y = r eiθ.
