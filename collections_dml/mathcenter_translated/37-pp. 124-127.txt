One model of economic development, taking into account the “external effect” of human capital, studies the generalized model of the Lukas R. [1] economic development of the two -section economic system, which includes the production sector and sector that forms “human capital”. The concept of human capital can be interpreted as a set of knowledge, skills and other qualities of an employee that increase the effectiveness of his contribution to the production process [2]. The level of human capital of a representative economic agent is denoted by H (t), and a share of its active time 125 Meni dedicated to production activities - U (t). The rest of the active time (1 - u (t)) is spent on the accumulation of human capital. The number of labor n (t) changes at a constant pace (n (t) = n0ent, n = const). The model uses the production function of Kobba - Douglas, taking into account the effective labor force U (t) h (t) n (t) (“internal effect” of human capital accounting), the average level of human capital in the economy in general HA (t) and the average share The time spent on production in the economy as a whole UA (T) (“external effect” of human capital accounting). The equation of the dynamics of the volume of physical capital has the form DK (t) dt = a (t) k (t) β [u (t) h (t) n (t)] 1–βha (t) γua (t) γ - - μkk (t) - c (t) n (t), (1) where k (t) is physical capital, a (t) - a function describing the effects of exogenously specified technological changes (a (t) = a0eαt, α = const> 0), C (t) - specific consumption, β ∈ (0, 1) - share of physical capital, γ> 0 - a parameter characterizing the external effect of human capital, µk> 0 - the norm of depreciation of physical capital. The equation of the dynamics of the accumulation of human capital can be recorded in the form of DH (t) dt = Δ (1 - u (t)) p (1- UA (t)) SH (t) qha (t) r - µh (t), (t), (t) (t), (t) (t) (t), ( 2) where µH> 0 is the amendment rate of human capital, δ> 0 - technological parameter, p, s, q, r are positive parameters, and p + s = 1, q + r = 1. Models of this type allow you to describe a decreasing effect removal from education [3]. 126    Предполагается, что индивид выбирает потребление и «трудовые усилия» таким образом, чтобы максимизировать функцию полной «дисконтированной» полезности:  J = ∞∫  0  e−ρtN(t)U [c(t)]dt → max, U [c( t)] = C 1–σ 1– σ, (3) where σ ∈ σ = r ++ \ {1}. In the case of σ = 1, U [c (t)] = ln c (t) is usually believed. Thus, the optimization task associated with this model consists in choosing such control parameters (C and U, U ∈ [0, 1]), which would maximize functionality (3) on permissible trajectories {K (t), h (t) )}, t ∈ [0, least), system (1), (2) subject to h (t) = ha (t), u (t) = ua (t), ∀t ∈ [0, Inf). The work provides some results of the numerically analytical study of the model (1)-(3). L and T R A T R A 1. Lucasr.e. On the Mechanics of Economic Development // J.

Morozov Institute of Mechanics and Engineering of the Executioners of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Morozov@mail.knc.ru A close solution of the problem of filtering viscoplastic fluid to the horizontal well is an accurate formula for calculating the flow rate of a vertical well in a circular layer under the non -linear law of filtering with the limit gradient [1 ]: Q = 2πkh µ ln (rk Rc) (4p - γ (rk - rc)), 4p> γ (rk - rc), (1) q = 0, 4p 6 γ (rk - rc), where k - where k - The permeability of the formation, h is its thickness, Rk is the radius of the power circuit, 4P is the pressure drop, γ is the maximum gradient, µ is the viscosity of the liquid, RC is the radius of the well. An approximate formula for calculating the flow rate of a horizontal well (GS) is obtained if in (1) replace RC with the given radius of R′C. The above radius is determined from the condition of the equality of the flow rate of the fittal of the “enlarged” vertical well of the radius R′C in the case of linear filtration in a circular layer. Пусть длина ГС равна L и ее ось отстоит от подошвы пласта на расстоянии δ. Начало координат поместим в центр ГС, а ось x направим вдоль оси скважины. Заменим ГС линейным источником равномерной интенсивности. В безразмерной форме точное решение задачи стационарной фильтрации ньютоновской жидкости к ГС в круговом пласте имеет вид  pd = ln(rkd)+1+σ(xd, yd)+ ∞∑  n=1  F (ξ2n) cos ξ 2 nδd cos ξ  2 n(δd+zd), (2)  128
