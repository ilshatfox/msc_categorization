The study of the dynamics of the elastic element of the canal wall is investigated the task of the flat movement of the ideal gas. (bones of bones) in the channel of endless length, the wall of which contains a deformable elastic element. The current in the rectangular channel J = {(x, y) E R2: \ xl <oo, o <u}. Elastic is the lower part of the wall U = O. The mathematical setting of the problem includes the equations: DR.r = r.pxx + r.pyy = o, (x, y) E J. (1) DW 1111 + F32V/ 111 + MW + NW + NW " + F31 W + FJOW = = P (R.PT (X, O, T) + R.PX (X, O, T)), XE (A, B); (2) Linearized boundary conditions arising from the conditions non-treatment, have the form of r.py (x, yo, t) = o, x e (-00.00); r.py (x, o, t) = o, x e (-o, a] u [b [ oo); (3) r.py (x, o, t) = wt (x, t)+vwx (x, t), he [a, b]. (4) Conditions for the lack of disturbances at an infinitely removed point: (2 + 2) - about r.px r.py x = ± oo - '(r.pt) x = --o = o, y (o, UO) · (5) as a result of solving a hydrodynamic problem (1) , (3) (5) by TFKP (1, 2] equation (2) can be recorded in the form of l (w) = - i (w + vw ') to (t, x) dt 61 · b - v 1 ( W + VW ') KX (t, x) dt, (6) where the numerically analytical method of studying the torture of the solution of the equation (6) has been developed and the conditions of its stability were obtained.

As an example, we give one of them. In a linear production corresponding to the small deflection of the elastic element and small indignations of the velocity of the working environment, the mathematical model is determined by the next equations and boundary conditions: <fjxx + <{jyy = o, (x, y): o < + oo, 1u11u1 <UO/2; <ru (x, ± UO/2, t) = o, x e (o, +oo); Chjx (o, y, t) = o, y (-wo/2, a) u (b, UO/2); 62
