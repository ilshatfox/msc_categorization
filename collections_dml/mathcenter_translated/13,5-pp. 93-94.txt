The features of some classes of differentiated display let F = {and (x, y), v (x, y)} - continuously differentiated display of the region D to D 1. The following is investigated in the view: under what conditions of the line on which the Jacobian is Jia I = D (U, V)/D (X, Y) is zero, are not special, that is, F is local injectively at the points of the curve, and at which injection is disturbed, at least for some points. An example of such display has been built. Let <p (x, y) = C - a certain family of simple smooth crows located in the area D, which the vector -function F (and, V) displays in curves with an equal equal apparent form V = G (U)+C1. The function 'lf; (x, y) will call the allied with <p (x, y), if the determinant of chjx'l/jy <py'l/jx is constant in D. We will assume that Jacobian I is equal to the new functions A (<p (x, y) and b ('lf; (x, y)). In this case, and V satisfy the parabolic system of equations, and v = g (u) + f (<p (x, y)), where F is an arbitrary differentiated function, and (x, y) satisfies the UZ equation; /) y - uy </ jx = a (<p) b ('lf;) f1 (<p). 93 Integrating it, we get the structural formula of the display: {and (x, y) = O. (SR) (J (f) + "F (CP), V (X, Y) = G (U) + F (CP) , (1) where a, (3, "(, f - arbitrary rather smooth functions; for i (x, y) we have equality I = j '(cf) a (' y) fz '(f). The task is solved Depending on the multiplicity of the zeros of the multipliers!. If a (SRO) = O, then the point SR (x, y) = SRO special, function F transfers it to the point (IO = "F (CPO), VO = G (IO) + J (CPO)), ER = SRO - a line of collapse according to our terminology. If J '(CP1) = O and CP1 - zero of order K, then with Knoye SR (x, y) =' P1 is not special, but With an odd line, the line EP = CP1 is displayed in the folds of the folds [1]. The same situation with the zeros of the multiplier {z '(f). In any casket D, not containing the line of collapse or prototypes of the folds, f (v.; . In more particular cases, analogues of conformal display were obtained. Some facts are transferred to the display of the region of three -dimensional space. Literature 1. Arnold V.I., Va Rchenko A.N.
