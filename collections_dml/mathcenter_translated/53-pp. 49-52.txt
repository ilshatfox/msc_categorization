Criteria of one -leafness and complete α -permissibility for P -Harmonic functions to the issue of monolithic analytical in d = {z ∈ C: | z | <1} of the functions, a large number of works are devoted, many criteria of one -leafy analytical functions are available. For harmonic functions, only a few criteria of one -legged is known. For P -Harmonic in D functions, only sufficient conditions of one -legged are known. The function F ∈ C2P (D), p ∈ N is called P -Harmonic (see [1]), if ∆PF = 0 V D, where ∆ is Laplace operator. 50 K.F. Amozova, E. G. Ganenkova is known (see [3]) that the function F ∈ C2P (D) is P -Harmonic and only when F has the following idea: F (z) = p∑ k = 1 | z | 2 (k - 1) fp --k+1 (z), (1) where each function is fp -k+1 = hp --k+1+gp --k+1 = ger∑ n = 0 a p --k+ 1n z n + b p - k + 1n z n, k = 1 ,. . . , P, is harmonic in D. The authors have received a criterion of one -leafy for P -Garmo in D functions in terms of their coefficients. Theorem 1. Let F (Z)-single-leaf in some surroundings of zero, p-harmonic in D function of the species (1). The function f (z) is single in d ⇔ ∀ z ∈ D \ {0}, t ∈ (0; π 2], the following condition is fulfilled: p∑ k = 1 | z | 2 (k - 1) φ∑ n = 1 (a p - k+1n z n - b p - k+1n z n) sinnt sin t 6 = 0. By analogy with P -Harmonic functions, Cream Teria a single -leaf for p - analytical functions, i.e., the functions of the form f (z) = p and 1∑ k = 0 z kak (z), where ak (z) is analytical in D functions. In [5] P. Lichberski and V.V. Starkov, they determined the α– achievable region. Region ω ⊂ rn, 0 ∈ ω is called α -permissible (relative to 0), α ∈ [0; 1), if for each point p ∈ω there is such a number R = R (p)> 0 that the cone k+(p, α, r) = {x ∈ R n: (x - p, p ‖p‖)> ‖x - p‖ cos απ 2, ‖x - p‖ 6 r} is contained in rn \ ω. K.F. Amozova, E.G. Ganenkova 51 They proved that the α -perilative areas are about the condition of the cone, and that the cigarette boggorphic in from the covered single Euclidean ball DN, N> 1, the functions f: dn - → cn, f (0) = 0 displaying DN On the α -periocent region, they have the property of heredity (inherit α -peridity), i.e., if r ∈ (0; 1), then each area F (RDN) α -lodging. It is known that in the class of harmonic functions f: c → c, f (0) = = 0, preserving orientation in D, the property of the bulge or starship of the region F (D) is not inherited. In such cases, the subclass is distinguished and considered quite a convex (quite star -shaped) functions that have their own heredity (see [4]). We will say that the P -Harmonic function f, f (0) = = 0 is quite α -permissible, α ∈ [0, 1) if for each R ∈ (0, 1] F displays DR = {Z SER CO : | z | <r} In the α -perceptive region. The criterion of complete α -permissibility for P -harmonic functions is obtained. Theorem 2. Let f (z) - P -Harmonic in D function (1), f (0 ) = 0 and jf (z)> 0 in D. Then F is quite α - percussion (α ∈ [0, 1)) ⇔z ∈ D The condition is performed: p∑ k = 1 | z | 2 (k - 1) Re {z (h ′ p --k+1f - g′p -k+1f)}> sin απ2 · | f | · √ a2 (z)+b2 (z), where a (z) = re {z p∑ k = 1 | z | 2 (k - 1) (h ′ p --k+1 - g′p --k+1 )}, B (z) = Im {z p∑ k = 1 | z | 2 (k - 1) (himate --k+1+g′p --k+1)}. As a result, we receive a criterion of complete α -pergimim for biharmonic (p = 2), harmonic (p = 1), as well as a well -known criterion (see [6], [2]) for analytical (p = 1, g = g = 1, g = G = 1, G = 0) in D functions; Also, a criterion of complete starship (case α = 0) for p - harmonic, harmonic (p = 1) 52 K.F. Amozova, E. G. Ganenkova [4], and analytical (p = 1, g = 0) (well -known starship condition ℜ {z f ′ (z) f (z)}> 0) in D functions.
