Kj1Sidman (Kazan) The definition of relative phase diet for multi -layer oil deposits is proposed to calculate relative phase ponds of kingdoms by water and oil. It is believed that the deposit consists of several layers. In the layers, the permeability changes through the linear for stake. Liquids are filtered according to the scheme of jets [1,2]. We determine the value of relative phase permeability. The value of the average parameter of the KN for the entire pack KN = I K, H: N is the number of p.1Asts in a pack. ,, ..: the average knowledge from11, 1 "phase permeability in water 1" q; = k, 0 -l: k.h ".
