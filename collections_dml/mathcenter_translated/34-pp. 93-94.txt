Modeling the optical properties of the environment using symbolic mathematics packages and the preparation of demonstration support of a special course on geometric optics T. A. Zhakova Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University, Kazan Geometric optics is an excellent illustration of differential and riman geometry, as well as the theory of ordinary differential equations . At the same time, it is a practical model for the spread of light rays in optically heterogeneous environments. The aim of the work is to create methodological manuals that teach about grams to maintain the methodological base of the course “Physical Picture of the World”. Some demonstration examples of the study of specific cases of the distribution of other rays in optically heterogeneous environments using the maple program are studies of focusing properties and dispersion properties of heterogeneous optical media, with cylindrical symmetry, spherical symmetry, as well as the phenomena of wave interference. All these examples also have animated accompaniment obtained using special Maple method of animation models based on the use of the PLOTS [Display] command using the InsEquence = True parameter. In this case, the sequences of the image are preliminarily prepared, corresponding to the different values ​​of the dynamic time of the model. 95 L and T R A T R A 1. Sailor A. Maple 6.

Task (Gursa): Find the function u (x, y) ∈ C (D) ⋂ c1.1 (D), which is in D by the solution of the equation Uxy = k exp u, k = const, (1) and satisfying the boundary conditions of U ( X, 0) = µ (x), x ∈ [0, A], U (0, Y) = ν (y), y ∈ [0, b], µ (0) = ν (0). (2) It is known [1, p. 321] The general representation of the decision (1), first half -obtained by Liwill: Exp U = 2 k ′ (x) ψ ′ (y) [onic (x) + ψ (y)] 2. (3) When constructing formula (3), the functions of ln accord (x), lnψ ′ (y), ln (2/k) are used. Therefore, it should be assumed that k> 0, ∗ ′ (x)> 0, ψ ′ (y)> 0. (4) 96
