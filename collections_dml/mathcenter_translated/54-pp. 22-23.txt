Dudov2 1 veronika0322@rambler.ru; Saratov National Research State University. N. G. Chernyshevsky 2 dudovsi@info.sgu.ru; Saratov National Research State University. N. G. Chernyshevsky considers the task of investing in a given polyhedron of the greatest convex function in the inclusion of Lebegov. The formula of the derivative in the directions of the target function of this extreme problem and the criterion of its solution have been established. Keywords: multi -party, internal assessment, derivatives in directions. Let m = {x ∈ Rp: <ai, x> +bi ≤ 0, i = 1, m} - a polyhedron, where ai ∈ RP, bi ∈ R; Ω = rp \ m; f (x) - convex final on RP function, having the only point of the minimum x ∗ = 0P. The task mon ≡ ≡ min yorn f (y −x) → max xgrum is considered. (1) For a fixed point x ∈ M, the value α = onic (x) is maximum, in which the inclusion of X + {y ∈ RP: f (y) ≤ α} ⊂ m. Thus, the task (1) requires to invest in the multi -party m of the largest in the inclusion of the Lower Lebeyo many functions F (x). Theorem 1. Let I ∈ [1: M]. Function ivil (x) = min xorni f (y −x), where ωi = {y ∈Rp: <ai, y>+b ≥ 0} is convex on RP, and its subdiffer in a lot of x ∈Rp is possible Express with the formula: ∂wor (x) = - {∂ f (z −x) ∩k (ai)}, (2) where ∂ f (x) - subdifferentilphunction f (·) second x, k (ai) = {v = αII: α≥ 0}, z - any point fromQi (x) = {z ∈ωi: uction (x) = f (z --x)}. Theorem 2. The function mon (x) is continuous and differentiated according to any direction g ∈Rp at any point x ∈Rp, and ′ ′ (x, g) ≡ lim α ↓ 0 α–1 [С +αg) − vent x)] =  0, if x ̸ = m, min iorn (x) max vusion (x) <v, g>, if x ∈ M,, (3) where i (x) = {i ∈ [1: m]: onic (x) = ∈ (x)}, and ∂ intern (x) are determined by the formula (2). Theorem 3. In order for the point x ∗ ∈ Here Cob is a convex shell of the set B. N.R. Abubakirov, L.A. Aksentiev 23 Crying 1. If the function F (·) is the norm, then the task (1) is the task of the inscribed ball, and the function ∗ (x) is concave on M (see, for example, [1]). Examples show that the function mon (x) may not be concave on M. remark 2. From the formula (3) it follows that the family of sets {∂ices (x): i ∈ I (x)} is the upper exosteer of the function gment (x ) at point x ∈ M (see [2]). Literature 1. Dudov S. I.

UDC 517.956 Direct and reverse tasks of the logarithmic potential with the final number of N.P. Abubakirov1, L.A. Aksentiev2 1 nail.abubakirov@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 leonid.aksentev@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in direct tasks is known for the region and it is necessary to determine the potential gradient outside or within this area. In the reverse tasks, the potential gradient in the vicinity is known and it is necessary to determine the area D. Following V.K. Ivanov [1], we continue to highlight the classes of regions with the final number of parameters that characterize the function displaying the single circle E = {| ζ | <1} To the region D. We also consider the direct and reverse tasks for the gradient of the logarithmic potential of a simple layer with various types of contours. Key words: logarithmic potential, gradient, integral equation. §one. Direct and reverse tasks for the gradient of the potential of a simple layer 1.1 with a gradient of the potential of a simple layer according to the curve L will call the function u (z) = ˆ l d s (τ) τ - z,
