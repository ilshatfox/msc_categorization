The approximate solution of which, using the "geometer-optical" asymptotic method [4.5], is obtained in the form of asymptotic decomposition of the solution in the sense of Poincar along degrees of small parameters, depending on the proximity of the point in question [5-8].

Zaitseva 29 in the work using the Maple computer mathematics system studied the theory of Laurent and isolated special points of a clear nature. Keywords: the function of the complex alternating, a series of Laurent, a special point, a system of computer mathematics Maple when solving specific tasks of complex analysis, we used the Maple computer mathematics system, which made it possible to free ourselves from mathematical calculations and transformations, but to clearly demonstrate the behavior of the function of the function itself and its decompositions In a row of Laurent near special points. It is known [1, 2] that a number of species are +φ∑ n = −urb (z – a) n, where a is a fixed point of the complex plane, CN - specified complex numbers, is called a near Laurent. Consider an example. Find the decomposition of the function f (z) = 1 (1 - z) (2+ Z) in a row of Laurent. The function f (z) is regular in the following areas: D1: | Z | <1, D2: 1 <| Z | <2, D3: | Z | > 2. The decompositions of the function in a row in each of these areas have the form: D1: F (Z) = 1 3+ger∑ N = 0 (1+ (−1) N 2N+1) Zn; D2: f (z) = - 1 3 +ger∑ n = 1 1 zn +1 3 +ger∑ n = 0 (−1) n zn 2n +1; D3: F (Z) = 1 3 +ger∑ n = 1 (−1) N -12N -1 −1 Zn. We will demonstrate the implementation of this example by means of the Maple computer mathematics system. First we describe the function:> restart; > f: = z-> 1/((1-z)*(z+2)); We compile a procedure depending on the following parameters: - the function itself (u), - equality that determines the variable and the decomposition point (Varpoint), - the degree of the residual member (n). > F: = proc (u, varint, n) local t; t: = lhs (varpoint); convert (u (t), varpoint, n), polynom); End ProC: 30 Lobachev Readings - 2019 ”The second parameter of the procedure will be considered as equality. Local variable T is assigned the left part of this equality (Z). Further, the procedure performs the decomposition (using the Series () command) function into a row and converts it into a polynomial appearance. We turn to the procedure named F and we get the decomposition of the function in the vicinity of the points: Z = 0 (region D1), Z = 1 and Z = −2. > F (f, z = 0, 5); > F (f, z = 1, 5); > F (f, z = -2, 5); The resulting expressions approximate the initial function in three areas. Also in the Maple package, you can illustrate the decomposition of a function in a row of Laurent in these areas. To do this, first connect the pack
