The use of mathematical packages to solving some problems of mechanics recently in connection with the creation of mathematical packages has become possible to obtain solutions to new problems of mechanics. In this message, it is supposed to consider the solution of the following problems. 1. A pinched plate is given, limited by a smooth contour. The density of the distributed vertical load is known. It is required to obtain the equation of the deflection of the plate. 2. A core is given, pinched on one side and articulatedly operated on the other. The cross -sectional area of ​​the rod is a variable. It is required to find the equation of the bend of the rod. M.F. Kulagina (Cheboksary) Construction of almost periodic solutions of some tasks of the theory of elasticity for multi-leafed stripes using a generalized discrete transformation of Fourier are constructed almost-periodic in the sense of solving various problems of elasticity for areas consisting of a finite number of stripes imposed by a friend friend. Each strip is characterized by its elastic constant. On the common boundaries of the stripes, various gluing conditions are set. Here is, for example, a setting, one of the tasks for a 1.5-lord strip. The horizontal strip −1 ≤ y ≤ 1 consists of two homogeneous-izotropic layers, which are limited by straight y = −1, y = 0, y = 1. Another same strip is laid on the upper strip. On the lines y = 0 and y = 1, the conditions of complete adhesion are set (three layers are connected to the straight line y = 0, on the line y = 1 148 - two layers): u (1) (x, y) | y = 0 = u (u (u (u (u (u 2) (x, y) | y = 0 = u (3) (x, y) | y = 0, v (1) (x, y) | y = 0 = v (2) (x, y) | y = 0 = v (3) (x, y) | y = 0, u (1) (x, y) | y = 1 = u (2) (x, y) | y = 1, v (1) (x, y) | y = 1 = v (2) (x, y) | y = 1, h1σ (1) y | y = 0 + h2σ (2) y | y = 0 = h3σ (3) y | y = 0, h1τ (1) xy | y = 0 + h2τ (2) xy | y = 0 = h3τ (3) xy | y = 0, where u (j) (x, y), v (j) (j) (j) (j) (j) x, y)-movements, σ ​​(j) y (x, y), τ (j) xy (x, y)-on spinning for the j-th layer, j = 1, 2, 3; H1, H2, H3 - the thickness of the stripes. It is required to find the functions u (j) (x, y), v (y) (x, y), σ (j) y (x, y), j = 1, 2, 3, if on the straight lines y = 1 and y = −1 set the following conditions: h1σ (1) y | y = 1 + h2σ (2) y (x, y) | y = 1 = f1 (x), h1τ (1) xy | y = 1 + h2τ (2 hundred (2 ) xy (x, y) | y = 1 = f2 (x), σ (3) y (x, y) | y = −1 = g1 (x), τ (3) xy (x, y) | y) | y) | = −1 = g2 (x). The solution to the problem was clearly built in the form of converging ranks of Fu Rie, the indicators of which, generally speaking, are not natural.
