The method of collocation of the solution of one class of integrated equations is devoted to the direct method of solving the integral equation asr = 'y + 1t cr (t) dt + fo 1 /i (t, t) RR (t) dt = f (t), o :::: ; t s 1, (1) where 'u s · is the desired parameter; RP (t) e with [o, 1] - the desired function, f (t) e c (lj (o, 1], h (t, t) e c (1j (o, 1] ® s [o, 1] - known functions. We introduce vector function ~ (t) = ('y, <p (t)), where' u s, cp (t) e [o, 1]. Then the equation (1) acquires Type a ~ = g ~+ tcp = f, g ~ = -y+ fo 1 cr (t) dt, t <p = fo \ (t, t) cr (t) dt. (2) for the space of the desired elements is taken x = {~} = = C®s [o, 1] with the norm 11 ~ /lx = /ih? Llc+l l ' /, where ll · llc is the usual DSHK of Simatu -Norm in the prostitute of continuous functions on the segment (o, 1 ], and for the space of the 11 -term parts, U = C (I) [O, 1] with the norm/lfllc • =/!

As nodes on the segment [o, 1], select extreme accurate accurate 110., a foreign car of the 1st kind. Approximately solving equation (1) is looking for "~ n (t) = (F'P; t, OP (t)), /'dog; <p "(t) =" l>} kfk-i, akec; nen.
