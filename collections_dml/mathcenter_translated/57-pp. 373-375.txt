. Geometrical Properties of Sun I.G. TSARKOV in the Article, There Solved Two Long-Running Question. It is obtained the characterization of a bounded compact set to be a sun via the property of acyclicity of the sets of the best approximation, and also it is proved that any bounded compact set possessess a continuous ε-selection for all ε > 0. The Solution of the Second Problem on B-Connection of a Bounded Sun is obtained as a corollary from the Solution of the First Problem.

Chernova1 1 chernova_olga@bsu.edu.ru; The Belgorod State National Research University, the Institute of Engineering and Digital Technologies in the article for the first-order elliptical system with comprehensive coefficients considers the task of Riman-Gilbert. Under certain conditions, the smoothness of the solution of the heterogeneous daglis system is proved on the right side of the regional condition. Key words: Riman-Gilbert's task, elliptical system, index. Let the area D of the complex plane C is limited by the smooth contour γ ∈ C 1, ν. The latter condition means that the derivative of parameterization of the smooth curve belongs to the class of the Helder Ca with indicator ν, 0 <ν <1. Recall that the function gment satisfies the condition of the Helder with the indicator µ, 0 <µ <1, on a certain set of the complex plane, if it exists. Such constant C> 0, that | ∗ (z1) −arent (z2) | ≤ c | z1 - z2 | µ for any z1, z2 ∈ E. The smallest constant C in this assessment coincides with the midnight [∗] µ = sup z1 ̸ = z2 | onic (z1) −arent (z2) | | Z1-Z2 | µ, 374 Materials of the School-Conference where the upper line is taken according to the points z j ∈ E. The class of limited functions that satisfy this condition is indicated by Cµ (E), regarding the norm | onic | = Sup e | onic (z) |+ [ip] µ it is a banach space [1]. If E is a closed area D, then you can introduce the space C 1, µ (D) continuously differentiated in D functions, which, together with their private derivatives, belong Cµ (D). Consider in the area D the heterogeneous system of the daglis lj (z)+a (z) φ (z)+b (z) φ (z) = f (z), z ∈ D, (1) where the differential operator l j = ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ y - j ∂ ∂x - acts in the class L -vector - functions and is determined by the constant matrix j ∈ Cl × L, its own values ​​λ which lie in the upper half -frost IM λ> 0, and l × l matrix coefficients A (z), b (z) and f (z) belong to the class Cµ (D). The corresponding homogeneous system l Jy = 0, in the assumption that the matrix J - Teplitsev was first studied by A. Duglis [1] in the framework of the so -called hypercomplex numbers. Later, the first -order elliptical systems with constant coefficients were examined by B. Boyarsky [2], R. P. Gilbert, J. L. Buchanan [3], and many other authors. For the system (1), we set the task of Rieman-Gilbert with the next regional condition reg (t) φ+(t) | γ = f (t), t ∈ γ, (2) where l × l-matrix-functions g (t) ∈ Cν and its definition are everywhere different from zero. In the work [4] it was shown that in the class c µ j (d) = {φ ∈C µ (d) ∩c 1 (d) | l jart ∈Cµ (D)} the task (1) - (2) Fredgolmova And its index is given by the formula  = - 1 π [argdetg] γ+ l, (3) where the increment [] γ is taken in the direction leaving the region D on the left. Theorem. If F ∈ C 1, µ (D), then any solution φ ∈ CµJ (D) the problem of Rimanagilbert (1) - (2) belongs to the class C 1, µ (D) and, therefore, the index formula (3) retains its strength and in class C 1, µ (D).
