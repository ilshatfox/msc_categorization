Let b = d2 dx2 + (2α + 1) x d dx - differential Constantire Operator, t y - a general shift operator corresponding to the Bessel operator [1]. In explicitly, the result of the application of the operator t y to the function f (x) is calculated according to the following formula t yf (x) = c ∫ π 0 f (√ x2 + y2 - 2xy cos accord) (sin gment) 2α d accord, where C = γ ( α + 1)/(√ π γ (α + 1/2)), x, y ∈ R +. Let σ> 0. We denote through m (σ, p, α) the set of all functions f (x), x ∈ R, satisfying the conditions: 1) f (x) - a whole even function of the exponential type ≤ σ; 2) f (x) ∈ LP, α. Theorem 1. For any function f ∈ M (σ, p, α), equality (bf) (x) = σ 2 (2α + 2) 3 f (x) + 4σ2 (2α + 2) π2 ipp∑ K is true for any function. = 1 (−1) k k2 t πk σ f (x), (1) where the row on the right side absolutely converges according to the norm of space LP, α. Theorem 2. Let f (x) ∈M (σ, p, α), then ‖bf‖, α ≤ (2α + 2) σ2 ‖f‖p, α. (2) Constant (2α + 2) σ2 - accurate, if you take everything p ∈ [1; urb]. Formula (1) is an analogue of the interpolation formula for the derivative of the whole function of the exponential type (see [2]), inequality (2) is an analogue of Bernstein inequality.

Plotnikova (Kazan) The reverse edge of the aerohydrodynamics for the wing profile with a rejected flair within the framework of the model of the ideal incompressible liquid solved the task of building an isolated wing profile with a rejected clinic for a given distribution of speed as a function of arc abscissa. Initially, the task of flowing a plate with a rejected shield was first considered, its analytical solution was obtained using the Christoffs-Shvartz formula. The distribution of speed is determined over the surface of the plate and the shield, when the back of the shield, according to the hypothesis of Zhukovsky-Chaplygin, is the point of flowing of the flow. Further, the resulting speed distribution was modified, namely, endless and zero speed values ​​at the corners are replaced by the final values. According to the modified speed distribution, the main reverse edge of the aerohydrodynamics is solved using the quasi -free method to fulfill the conditions of resolution [1]. As a result, smoothly streamlined profiles with a rejected closing were obtained. The aerodynamic calculation of the obtained profiles showed that the presence of a rejected click in the profile allows you to improve its aerodynamic characteristics.
