) The numerically analytical method of solving the regional problem of the course in the curved channel with a permeable border is the task of the course of the ideal inconsistent fluid in the curved channel with the flow of fluid across the desired boundary. According to the hydrodynamic analogy, it is interpreted as the task of a stationary anode shaped shape with a linear cathode tool with simultaneously taking into account the production of current and uneven polarization of the anode. As a result of solving a mixed regional problem in the canonical area of ​​the variable T, a condition is obtained, connecting the actual and imaginary parts of the DW/DT function on a free grade, where W is the integrated potential of the current. The expression obtained in the sulfate for the potential '!/; The electric field and to the full ratio connecting the length of the arc and the material part of the LN (DW/DZ) function on the free border allow the initial task to solve the system of non -linear integral equations to find parameters that determine the conformal display of the canonical area to the physical. fifty
