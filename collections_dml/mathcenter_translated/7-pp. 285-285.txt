Improving methods 1: FISTIC SOLUTION OF TWOPHASIS FROMISE equations. Calculation of pressure fields, saturation and direction of filtration flows for real oil fields V.Ya. Bulygin, D.V. Bulygia, D.M. Kladman, D.V. Shevchenko Mathematics and mechanics named after N.G. Chebotarev Kazan State University 420008, Kazan, ul. University, 17 The purpose of this study is to model the movement of oil and water in real oil layers. A well -known two -dimensional model of two -phase filtration was chosen as a mathematical model [1] (the equations are outstretched in the thickness of the formation). According to the technological document, the smallest measurement error and a sufficient amount have measurements of morons/receiving wells, therefore they are used to set the boundary conditions in the wells. From the accumulated experience in modeling filtration processes occurring in real deposits, it is well known that the calculation on sufficiently detailed grids requires significant time costs. Therefore, the search and use of effective and accurate calculation methods constantly remains an urgent problem. At the moment, one of the most “fast” of the decrease in the solution of the equations of the parabolic and elliptical type is the multi-section method [2). Its use to determine the pressure allowed us to significantly accelerate the entire calculation process. This made it possible to conduct a multiple calculation for each deposit with various parameters of the model for its best adaptation in the development of development and further use in forecasting.
