) Polynomas approaches in Hausdorf metric, let F (X)-limited 2π-periodic, generally speaking, multi-digit function with a supplemented schedule, Δ> 0, s (f, δ; x) = min {sup {f (t): x--x- δ <t ≤ x}, sub (t (t): x ≤ t <x+δ}}, i (f, δ; x) = max {inf (t (t): x - δ <t ≤ x} , Inf {f (t): x ≤ t <x+ δ}}, µ (f; Δ) = Inf x {s (f, Δ; x) - i (f, δ; x)}/2. If in the definition of s (f, δ; x) change min to max, and in the definition of i (f, δ; x) - max on min, then the values ​​of s (f, δ; x) and i (f, δ; x) respectively, which by means of equality ω (f; δ) = SUP X {S (F, Δ/2; X) - I (F, Δ/2; X)} The uniform modulus of continuity ω (f; δ) of the function is determined f. 197 Now we introduce the following characteristic of the function F: r (f; δ) = ω (f; δ) + δ µ (f; δ) + δ. We also put R ∗ (f; Δ) = SUP {R (f; t): t ≥ Δ}. In terms of R (f; δ) and r ∗ (f; Δ), new ones can be indicated, and at the same time asymptotically accurate, estimates of the smallest evasions of Hen (F) functions F from trigonometric polynomas of the order not higher than N in the Hausdorf metric. Theorem. With all the large enough n (n> n (f)) we have Hen (F) ≤ Inf {Δ: 1 Δ (ln r (f; δ) + 5 2 ln ln (e (f; δ)) + 11) <) <) < N}. In the class of limited functions, a constant 5/2 in front of LN LN (ER (F; Δ)) cannot be replaced by a value of a smaller −1/2. Investigation 1. For all sufficiently large n hen (f) ≤ 1 n ln r ∗ (f; 11 n) + 5 2n ln ln (eer ∗ (f; 11 n)) + 11 n. Investigation 2. For all sufficiently large n hen (f) ≤ 1 n ln (1 + 2nω (f; 1 n)) + 5 2n ln ln (e + 2enω (f; 1 n)) + 11 n. This inequality clarifies the inequality of V. A. Popov and bl. Sendova Hen (F) ≤ (1 + O (1)) · 1 n ln (nω (f; 1 n)) subject to nω (f; 1/n) → ¾, n → urb. Investigation 3. If lim µ (f; δ)> 0 for Δ → 0, in particular, if the function F is far from everywhere, then Hen (F) ≤ C (F) N, N = 1, 2, ..., where C (F) does not depend on n. 198
