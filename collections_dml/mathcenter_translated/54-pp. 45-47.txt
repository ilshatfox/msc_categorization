The injections of polygarmonic and polyanalytic functions K.F. Amozov1, E.G. Ganenkova2, S. Ponnusov3 1 amo-kira@rambler.ru; Petrozavodsk State University 2 g_ek@inbox.ru; Petrozavodsk State University 3 samy@isichennai.res.in; Indian Statistical Institute, Chenna Center Sets, the article presents new injections for polygarmonic and polyanalytic functions in a circle. Key words: one -leaf, polygarmonic function, polyanalytic function. A large number of studies, Russian and foreign, are devoted to the conditions of one -leafness (injection) of analytical in a single circle d = {z ∈C: | z | <1} functions. One of these conditions is the following criterion for the one -leafness of I.E. Bazilevich in terms of analytical function coefficients. Theorem. [1] Analytical VD Foundation F (Z) = ∑mber = 1 Cn Zn is single -leafed when and only when for each z ∈D and each t ∈ [0, π/2] it is fair φ∑ n = 1 cn sinnt sin t zn -1 ̸ = 0, (sinnt sin t) ∣∣∣ t = 0 = n. (1) For harmonic in D functions, much less was obtained (see, for example, [2] and [3]). The report will present the criteria for monolithic and polyaanalytic vd functions published by the authors in [4], as well as related results. Let p ∈N. Definition. The integrated function F ∈C 2P (D) is called P-Harmonic (or polygarmonic) BD, if telish f (z) = 0 BD, where the engine is a laplass operator. It is known [5] that the function F ∈C 2P (D) is P -Harmonic VD then and only when F is represented in the form of f (z) = p∑ k = 1 | z | 2 (k - 1) fp −K+1 (Z), where each function is FP -K+1 = hp - k+1+g p --k+1, k = 1,. . . , p, is harmonic in D. Without limiting the community, we can assume that hp -k+1 (0) = 0 = gp --k+1 (0). Recall that each harmonic function F VD can be recorded in the form of F = h+G, 46 materials of the International School-Conference where H and G are analytical in D functions. JF JF JF JF. For more information about P -Harmonic functions, see, e.g., [6]. Using the method of I.E. Bazilevich [1], we received the following theorem. Theorem 1. [4] Let f (z) = ∑p k = 1 | z | 2 (k-1) fp --k+1 (z)-p-harmonic in D function, single-leaf in some zero, where fp -k+1 (z) = ger n = 1 (a (p --k+ 1) n z n +b (p --k +1) n z n) (k = 1,., P) - harmonic in D functions. Then F (Z) is one -leafing in Dtogd and only when for all z ∈D \ {0} and t ∈ (0, π/2] the following condition p∑ k = 1 | z | 2 (k - 1) φ is fulfilled ∑ n = 1 (a (p --k+1) n z n −b (p --k+1) n z n) sinnt ̸ = 0. (2) similarly a criterion of one -leafy for P -analytical in D functions. Determination. For p. ∈ N will call p - the analytical (or polyanalytic) function in d polynomials by variable z f (z) = p - 1∑ k = 0 z k ak (z), the coefficients of which are analytical in d functions {ak (z)} p - 1 k = 1. It is equivalent to the fact that f (z) ∈ C P (D) is a solution to the generalized equation of the Koshha-Riman ∂p f /∂zp = 0 in D (more details, see e.g., [6]). Theorem 2. [4] Let f (z) = ∑p -1 k = 0 z k ak (z) - p - Analytical in D function, one fox in some vicinity of zero, where ak (z) = ger n = 0 c (k) n z n, k = 1,., p −1, - analytical in D functions. Then f (z) is one -leafed in Dtogd and only when for all z ∈D \ {0} and t ∈ ( 0, π/2] is made P -1∑ K = 0 zk φ∑ n = 0 c (k) n sin (n −k) t zn ̸ = 0.
