. An illocal task with an integral condition for the parabolic equation of O. Yu. Danilkin Samara State Academy of Railways, danola@mail.ru will consider in the cylinder qt = {(x, t): x ∈ ω, t ∈}}, where Ω is a limited area in RN with a smooth boundary, the parabolic equation LU ≡ Ut - (aijuxj) xi + a (x, t) u = f (x, t). (1) Put for the equation (1) the task with the initial value U (x, 0) = onic (x) (2) and non -cabinal condition u | ST = ∫ t 0 ∫ ω k (x, y, t, τ) u (y, τ) dy dτ, 0 <t <t, x ∈ ∂ω. (3) Note that (3) is an integral condition. It causes to complete difficulties in the study of the task (1) - (3), and the camp of the research methods require a certain modifier. This work shows the possibility of transition from the study of the non-Konkalous task (1)-(3) to the study of the first bossal task for loaded parabolic equia. 72 Let K (x, y, t, τ) ∈ C1 (ω × ω × [0, t] × [0, t]). Determine the operator b: bu = u (x, t) - ∫ t 0 ∫ ω k (x, y, t, τ) u (y, τ) dy dτ. We denote the value of the operator B through V (X, T) when it is action on the function U (x, t): Bu = v. Then u (x, t) - ∫ t 0 ∫ ω k (x, y, t, τ) u (y, τ) dy dτ = v (x, t). (4) This is the integral equation of Voltaire regarding the function U (x, t). Due to the properties of the nucleus (x, y, t, τ) there is a single solution of the equation (4), representable in the form of u (x, t) = v (x, t) + ∫ t 0 ∫ ω γ (x, y , t, τ) v (y, τ) dy dτ, where γ (x, y, t, τ) is the nucleus resolvent k (x, y, t, τ). Denote φ (x, t) = ∫ t 0 ∫ γ γ (x, y, t, τ) v (y, τ) dy dτ. Fair Lemma. Task (1) - (3) is equivalent to the problem LV + Lφ = F (X, T), V (X, 0) = onic (X), V | ST = 0. 73
