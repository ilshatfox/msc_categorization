Materials of the International School-Conference of UDC 517.5 Asymptotic behavior of the two-link area when it is stretched along the axis of the abscissa D.N. Dautova1, S.R. Nasyrov2 1 dautovadn@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 Snasyrov@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University studies asymptotic behavior of the module of a fairly arbitrary double region with its stretching along the abscissa axis. An analogue of the classical theorem is obtained, which allows to justify the alleged asymptotic formula, which is already proven for the case symmetrical relative to the axis of the abscissa of the region. Thus, the response to the problem of Wurorin in the asymmetric case is given. Keywords: conformal module, two -way region, four -sided, quasiconform display, convergence to the core of the regions, simple ends of the flat area. One of the most important geometric characteristics of the flat double area B is its conformal module. If b conformally equivalent to the circular ring {r1 <| z | <r2}, then (see, e.g., [1]) M (b): = 1 2π ln R2 R1. The module is invariant relative to conformal display, but is not preserved under the influence of quasiconic display of regions. In the work, we will consider a special case of quasiconic display - stretching FH along the axis of the abscissa with the coefficient h: x + i y 7 → h x + y, h> 0. M. Vuinen set the task of studying the asymptotic behavior of the module of the region BH: = FH (b) With an unlimited increase H (see, e.g., [2]). In [2], the asymptotics of the BH module was found in the case when B is the difference of two homothetic rectangles with the sides parallel to the coordinate axes. In [3] it is shown that m (bh) ∼ 1 2ch, c = bˆ a d x g (x) - f (x), h →+urb. Here b is an area symmetrical relative to the abscissa axis, the border of which consists of two curves γ1 = {x + i y: | y | = f (x), a ≤ x ≤ b}, γ2 = {x + i y: | y | = G (x), C ≤ x ≤ d}, − music <a <b <d <mm, 0 ≤ f (x) <g (x), a ≤ x ≤ b. The aim of this work is to establish a similar fact for asymmetric doubles of a sufficiently arbitrary type. Let −urb <c <a <d <mm and the functions f1, f2 ∈C [a, b], g1, g2 ∈C [c, d] are such that f1 (a) = f2 (a), f1 (b) = f2 (b), f1 (x)> f2 (x), a <x <b; D.N. Dautova, S.R. Nastyov 147 G1 (C) = G2 (C), G1 (D) = G2 (D), G1 (X)> G2 (X), C <X <D; g2 (x) <f2 (x) ≤ f1 (x) <g1 (x), a ≤ x ≤ b, consider the double area b, the border of which is described by the equations: γ1 = {x + i y: y = f1 (x), y = f2 (x), a ≤ x ≤ b}, γ2 = {x + i y: y = g1 (x), y = g2 (x), c ≤ x ≤ d}, theorem 1. With h → → → → → → M (BH) has the following asymptotic behavior: m (bh) ∼ 1 (c1 + c2) h, c1 = bˆ a d x g1 (x) - f1 (x), c2 = bˆ a d x f2 (x) - g2 (x) (x) (x) (x) (x) (x) (x) (x) 1) One of the key points of evidence of theorem 1 is the following theorem 2 about the uniform convergence of the sequence of conformal display of the two -link areas, the module of which strives for zero. This theorem is an analogue of the classical theorem of Radi (see [4]). Consider the sequence of the GN double -raised areas, limited by Zhordanov curves C1N and C2N, which converge like a carateodori nucleus (see [4]) to a single -link region G, the border of which consists of two Zhordanov Cruts C1 and C2, crossing at one point Z̃. Let DN - the sequence of non -centric rings dn = {| ζ | <1} \ {| ζ+ rn | <rn}, 0 <rn <1/2, rn ↗ 1/2, n → °, which converges like a core to a circular moon d = {| ζ | <1} \ {| ζ+1/2 | <1/2} with zero angles. Theorem 2 (generalized radio theorem). Let the sequence of functions z = fn (ζ) conformally displays areas DN on GN, FN (0) = z0n ∈ ∂GN. Let the function z = f (ζ), conformally displays the nag, and f (0) = z0, z0 ̸ = z̃, z0 ∈ ∂g, and the simple ends of the region D, corresponding to the point (−1), go into simple ends corresponding to point z̃. Let Z0n → Z0, N → inous. If there are homeomorphisms G1N: C1 → C1N, G2N: C2 → C2N, such that ∀ε> 0 ∃n: ∀n ≥ N are inequalities | G1N (t) - t | <ε, t ∈ C1; | g2n (s) - s | <ε, s ∈C2, then fn (ζ) â F (ζ) in d. Proof of theorem 2 is based on the use of the theory of simple ends of the sequences of the regions converging to the nucleus [5], and the theorems such as Karateodori about the connection of the court’s context to the nucleus of the regions with the convergence of the corresponding conformal display in the event of a boundary normalization of these display ([6], theorem 14.6).
