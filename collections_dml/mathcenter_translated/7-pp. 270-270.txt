. Optimization of the work of the Group G of Azlift wells, taking into account their interference V.S. Agaev, G.A. Mamedov, V.V. Makhov Azerbaijani State Research and Design Institute of Oil Industry (Aznipineft) 370033, Baku. st. Aga-Neimatullah, 39 It is known that when developing oil fields, the Nlast well system obeys the equation of the statics of the species fu · QJ = LR; = PK - P, where •• i q 1 is a fluid flow rate, p, - slaughter pressure, a; 1 - the coefficients of mutual action of the wells. Knowing the boundaries of changes in the permissible depression of the LR;, we select three characteristic values ​​P; And, deciding the system of linear equations, we find the corresponding Qi. From the equation of the lift R, j f (p, q ,, q) = O P I find the corresponding values ​​Q, 1, and then, using the known update proximation, determine the characteristics of the wells Q, = A, · Q ~, + B, · Q. ,; +C,. Then, with the use of the method of Lagrange multipliers, we solve optimizing problems in various productions: TAXL: Q ;, maxi; (s "· q, - s,; · q") with IQ ,, == Q,; min l; q ,, when 'i.q, = q. 270
