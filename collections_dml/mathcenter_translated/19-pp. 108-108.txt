) The almost-periodic solutions of the main tasks of the theory of elasticity for multi-layer stripes setting the problem. Horizontal strip H0 S U: 5 HP, -OO <x <OS, consisting of P -uniform -isotropic layers, separated by straight y = h1, j = 1, P -1. is located in equalization. The conditions of the 1st, 2nd or 3rd species are set at the border of the strip, and the conditions of contact (strict adhesion, smooth contact, contact with friction) are set on direct connections. Find the functions on the spins a ~ j) (x, y), a ~ j) (x, y), t ~ v (x, y) and movements u <i> (x, y), v (j) (x , y) in every layer. The solution to the problem is built in the space of almost-periodic functions with the help of a generalized transformation of Fourier, introduced and studied in (1] and [2]. A method based on the use of the functions of Papkovich-Neiber is used [3]. The solution to the problem was obtained in The form of the absolutely convergent row Fourier, which converges absolutely and evenly. The work is supported by the RFFIF (project 01-01-00720).
