Key words: dual smell hypothesis, critical points, critical values ​​of polynomes. In 1981, the SMIL [1] put forward the next hypothesis. Let F - Polin, Deg F ≥ 2, such that f (0) = 0 and f ′ (0) = 1. Denote s (f) = min {∣∣∣∣ f (ζ) ζ ∣∣∣∣: f ′ (Ζ) = 0}, KN = SUP {S (F): Deg F = N, F (0) = 0, F ′ (0) = 1}. The hypothesis claims that KN = 1–1/N. The following inequalities have been proven: 1- 1 n ≤ KN <4. There are a large number of assessments for various particular cases. Some of them can be found in the article [2]. The aim of this work is to study the dual chipping hypothesis. Hypothesis. Let F - Polin, Deg F ≥ 2, such that F (0) = 0 and F ′ (0) = 1. Then there is ζ - a critical point F, such that∣∣∣∣ f (ζ) ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ∣≥ 1n. Tishler [3] proved that the hypothesis is true for such polynomas that f (ζ) ζ = const. 188 Materials of the International School-Conference for all critical points f. Dubinin and Sugava [4] proved that there is such a critical point ζ, for which ∣∣∣∣ f (ζ) ζ ∣∣∣∣≥ 1N4N. The hypothesis is easily checked for small values ​​N, however, already starting with N = 4, the check is a complex task that requires long -term reasoning. The proof for n = 4 was represented by a ticer in [3]. The main result of this work is the proof of the dual smaliness hypothesis for cases n = 5 and n = 6. The studies of the first author were conducted with the support of the RFFI (project 1701-00282). Literature 1. Smale S. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and Complexity Theory // Bull. Amer. Math.

Sitdikov3 1 kirillov_math@mail.ru; Kazan State Energy University 2 drnikitin@rambler.ru; Kazan State Energy University 3 airat_vm@rambler.ru; The Kazan State Energy University is given the formulation of a simple algebraic model with the rules of supercurrent for isospinum. The model is tested on a two -widel system and shows that they can be obtained by the related conditions of two nucleons, which can be obtained using a special isometric operator.
