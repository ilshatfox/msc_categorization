Evaluation of the error for one approximate method for calculating integrals such as Koshi Let L is a simple smooth closed contour on the shyskost of a complex alternating z. The swim inside L will be inner and designate D+, and the area is additional to D+ U H.1, containing an infinitely removed point, we will call external and denote d-. We offer a method of approximate calculation of the integral type of koshi, suitable for a wide class of contours l and rafts! (T). The essence of this method is as follows. Let the function W = IP (Z) display the area D+ conformally to a single circle, moreover; P (O) = O, Z =? J; (W) - the reverse function. Consider the function f (w) = f (? J; (w)) on a single circle. N SN (EI6) == e ckeik/1-Part partial amount of the row k = -n Fourier functions f (EIE). Replace the density F (T) with SN (<p (t)). Let F+(Z) - a function determined by an integral such as a cat, and f ~ (z) - a function determined by integral.jum 2 ;; J s,.
