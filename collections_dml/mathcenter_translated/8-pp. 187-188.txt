) The criteria of the element of the best approximation for midnight and VRAI SUP -Norm for limited on the segment ∆ = [a, b] weight P (x) = (p - (x), p+(x)) and functions f (x), following E, following . P. Dolzoko and E. A. Sevastyanov, put (f, p) (x) = f+(x) p+(x) - f - (x) p - (x) (f+(x) and f - (x ) - cuts) and determine the midnight | f | p, ∆ = sup {| (f, p) (x) | : x ∈ ∆}. The point y ∈ ∆ will call p+—th or p - - - the difference of the difference q (x) −f (x) polynoma q (x) and functions f (x), if with any δ> 0 | q - f | p, ∆ = = SUP {± (q - f, p) (x): x ∈ (y - δ, y + δ) ∩∆} respectively; We call the point Y the point of the dual P-extremum of the difference Q (X)-F (X) on ∆ if both equalities are performed simultaneously. Algebraic Polina Q (x) degree ≤ n (n = 0, 1,.) Is a polynoma of the best approximation of order n function f (x) in the P-Norm on ∆ then and only when at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled : (1) there is a dual p - excess of the difference Q (x) - f (x) on ∆; (2) there is a family of n+2 alternating p+-and P-the difference of the difference Q (X)-F (X) on ∆ (Chebyshevsky P-alternan); (3) There is no algebraic polynoma R (x) degrees ≤ n, positive in all p+points and negative in all P-p-a difference Q (X)-F (X) 187 on ∆. Conditions (2) and (3) are equivalent here, as in the case of ordinary uniform metric. Similarly, the criterion of the polynoma of the best approximation of a substantially limited nation functions f (x) with || f || ∆ = vrai sup {| f (x) | : x ∈ ∆}, and with all δ> 0 for extreme VE ± -tochka y ∈ ∆ difference q (x)-f (x), respectively (and for the dual vrai-extremum at the same time), equality should be performed || q-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f- || ∆ = vrai sup {± (q (x) - f (x)): x ∈ (y - δ, y + δ) ∩∆}. In order for the algebraic Polino C (X) degree across (n = 0, 1,.) Was a polynoma of the best approximation of order N of a substantially limited function F (x) on ∆ in the Vraisup-Norm, it is necessary to execute at least one of Conditions: (1) there is a dual vrai-extremum of the difference Q (x)-f (x) on ∆; (2) There is a family of n + 2 alternating VE +- and VE- a difference of a difference by ∆. The results easily apply to cases of approaching functions by rational functions and generalized polynomas.
