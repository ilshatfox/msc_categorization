Extraphlation Properties of Interporation Scales K.V. Lykov The Paper Describes The Relationship BetWeen Interporation and Extraphlation Constructs. For SOME CLASS of Interpolation Space Obtained by the Real Interporation Method, An Extraphlation Description Is Pressented. It is shown that for such spaces it is possible to replace theK -functional in the interpolation description by a parametrized family of norms of exact interpolation spaces with characteristic functions tθ, θ ∈ (0,1) (in particular, by the family of norms of peetre's spaces). Keywords: Interpolation Spaces, Interporation Functor, Extraphlation Spaces, Peetre’s Spaces, The Real Interporation Method. UDC 517.53: 517.947.942 On the analogue of the Euler equation for extreme display with Ki, S- or KO, S-medium characteristic A.N. Malyutina1, K.A. Alipova2 1 nmd@math.tsu.ru; National Research Tomsk State University 2 aka@math.tsu.ru; The National Research State University of In-Real Work continues the study of the differential and extreme properties of non -meomorphic display with (Ki, S, KO, S)-an means of means of an means. In the theory of flat quasiconic displays to solve extreme problems, a variation method is developed and successfully used [2, 3, 9]. We offer an attempt to apply this classic method for solving extreme problems in the class of display with an medium characteristic. Keywords: display with an medium characteristic, differential properties, variation, extreme display. Let F: D → Rn - display of class w 1 n, loc (d). Then, almost everywhere in the dio, the values ​​are the size | ∇ f (x) | = (n∑ i, j = 1 (∂ fi ∂x j) 2) 12, j (x, f) = Det (∂ fi ∂x j (x)), and if j (x, f) ≥ 0 is honored everywhere , then the local characteristics of Hi (x, f) = j (x, f) l n (x, f), ho (x, f) = ln (x, f) j (x, f) were determined. Consider the two limited areas D and D ∗ in the Euclidean space RN, for which there is a display f: d → d ∗, f (x) = (f1 (x), f2 (x), ..., fn (x)) - From the covered, continuous, satisfying the conditions of FI (x) ∈W 1N, LOC (D ∗), i.e. ∀x ∈ D exists an u -oxation of a point x ∈ D such that f j | u ∈W 1n (u), f −1i, j (x) ∈W 1n, Loc (d ∗). Display F is called the display with Ki, S (D, D ∗) - an average characteristic (with KO, S (D, D ∗) - averaged characteristic), if ki, s (x, f) =  1 | D | ˆ D (j (x, f) l n (x, f)) s dσx  1 s ≤ ki, s (f), (1) 242 Materials of the International School-Conference K ∗ I, S (X, F) =   1 | D | ˆ D (j (x, f) l n (x, f)) s | j (x, f) | dσx   1 s ≤ k ∗ i, s (f), ko, s (x, f) =   1 | D | ˆ D (ln (x, f) | j (x, f) |) s dσx   1 s ≤ ko, s (f), (2) k ∗ o, s (x, f) =                   1 | D | ˆ D (ln (x, f) | j (x, f) |) s (x, f) | dσx  1 s ≤ k ∗ o, s (f), here S ≥ 1, | D | -the N-dimensional measure of the Lebeg region D. Denote through ki, s (d, d ∗) and k ∗ i, s (d, d ∗) a set of display f: d → d ∗, such as ki, s (f) and , respectively, k ∗ i, s (f) is finite (ko, s (f) and, accordingly, k ∗ o, s (f) is finite). The differentiation of such display is proved in [1]. Display F: D → D ∗ is called extreme in a certain class K of ki, s (or from k ∗ i, s) if f ∈ K and Ki, S (F) ≤ Ki, S (G) (or K ∗ I , s (f) ≤ k ∗ i, s (g)) for all g ∈ K. Functionals (1), (2) are an integral characteristic of the display with the S -medium characteristic. These functionality are invariant relative to mebius transformations. Lemma 1. For any F ∈ Ki, S (D, D ∗) (K ∗ i, S (D, D ∗)) The class of permissible variations is not empty. For quasiconic displays, this statement has been proved in [4]. Lemma 2. Let F: D → D ∗ - Extreme Display with S -Middle characteristic. Then, for him, the identity is ˆ d n∑ i, j ∂ ∂ai j (λs (x, f)) ∂ω ∂x j d x = 0, ˆ d n∑ i, j ∂ ∂ai j (ko, s (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f (x, f, )) ∂ω ∂x j d x = 0, ˆ d n∑ i, j ∂ ∂ai j (ki, s (x, f)) ∂ω ∂x j d x = 0, for any function ω (x) = ζ (| x |)), where ζ (y) is a smooth material function with a carrier in d ∗. Lemma 3. Let F: D → D ∗-Extreme Display with S-Middle Terilicism. Then, for him, the identity is ˆ d n∑ i, j ∂ ∂ai j (k ∗ i, s (x, f)) · ∂ω ∂x j dσx = 0, i = 1.2, ..., n, where ω (x) = ζ (f (x)), ζ - smooth material function with the carrier in d ∗. A.N.

Then there is a ball B (x0, ρ ) such that ∀h, | h | <ρ, with the corresponding choice ρ [5, Lemma 2.12] ∀t, 0 ≤ T ≤ 1, display ft (x, h, p) = f (x) + t (x + heP) - f (x) ), where EP is the p-a single coordinate vector in RN, is defined and is homeomorphism in B (x0, ρ) for any p = 1.2, ..., n. Theorem 1. Let s ≥ 2N–2 and display f: d → D ∗ is an extreme displacement in the class Ki, S (D, D ∗). Then F ∈ W 22 (D ′) for any sizes D ′ such that j (x, f)> 0 on the closure D ′ and D
