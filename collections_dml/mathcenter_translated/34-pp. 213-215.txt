. Algebra deformations Lee type G2 over the field of characteristics 2 N. G. Chebochko Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N. I. Lobachevsky, Chebochko@mail.ru Classic algebras Lee over the field K characteristics 2 and 3 may have non -trivial global deformations. The description of the global deformations of the algebra of the type C2 is given in the work [1], [2]. In [3] and [4], the stiffness of the classic algebras of all types, except for the algebra of the type C2 at p = 3, above the field of characteristics p> 2. The spaces of local deformations 215 of the classic algebrus Lee with a homogeneous system of roots above the lime characteristics 2 are found at 5]. Let L - algebra type G2 over the field of characteristics 2. Group G = Autl is a sympylex group SP (6). In [5] it is proved that the representation of SP (6) on H2 (L, L) is equivalent to the composition of the morphism of the Frobenius and the natural presentation of ∧3 V, where V is the standard six -dimensional module over SP (6). Many continued cocked ∧3 V is divided into two G-orbit. Take the representatives of the orbits: coccyge ψ1 weight 8α + 4β and coccyge ψ2 zero weight, and build a deform of the type of type FI (x, y) = [x, y] + ψi (x, y), x, y ∈ L. As a result We get two new algebras Li L1 and L2. The following result is proved. Theorem. 1) L1 and L2 - simple algebras Lee. 2) L1 and L2 are not limited algebras; 3) L2 has external semi -simple differentiation; 4) L1 does not have external semi -spent differentiations. From the theorem it follows that L, L1, L2 is not isomorphic. The work was carried out with the support of the RFFI, project 05-01-00580. L and T R A T R A 1. Kostrikin A.I.
