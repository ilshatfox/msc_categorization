) Closed holomorphic functions closed by the windows, which allowed the local description, the introduction uses terminology from [1] - [2], according to functional analysis - from [3]. Everywhere further ω is the area on the complex plane C; H (ω) - the space of all holomorphic functions; P ⊂ H (ω) - some separated by a local convex space above the field C, further called simply space. If the space p is the topological module over the ring of polynomials C [z], z ∈ C, that is, multiplication by an independent variable Z continuously by p, then for brevity we call p just a module. Further, everywhere under the sequence in ω is understood as an empty, final or endless sequence of the type λ = {λn} ⊂ ω, where n = 1, 2 ,. . ., which does not have maximum points in ω. For the subsidence b ⊂ ω through λ (b) = ∑λn∈B 1, we denote the number of points of the sequence λ that fell into B. The function λ (λ) = λ ({λ}), λ ∈ ω, - the division of the sequence λ. Relations and operations =, ⊂, \, ∪, ∩ for sequences are determined respectively through the integrity relations and operations ≡, 6, -, +, Inf for their divisions. Submissions (corresponding work) of an empty set of elements is zero (respectively 1). For a non -equal function F 6≡ 0 from H (ω), the sequence of all roots of the function F, translated taking into account the multiplicity, we denote ZF. The subspace of the I module P is a winding over C [z] (the term z-invariant or subspace is also common, invariant relative to the shift, [4]-[5]), or then just a windows, if for any p ∈ C [Z] and F ∈ P We have 280 pf ∈ I. For a submodule i ⊂ p, we consider zi = ∩fĕf - the sequence of zeros of the perodul I. The space P is stable if for any function F ∈ P and the point λ ∈ C of the condition f (z)/(z)/(z)/(z)/(z)/(z)/(z) z - λ) ∈ H (ω) follows f (z)/(z - λ) ∈ P. The sequences λ ⊂ ω are compared in the module P. The special diligence of the type I (λ) = {f ∈ P: λ ⊂ zf}. Obviously, if P is a stable module and I (λ) - non -equal dwelling, i.e., I (λ) 6 = {0}, then zi (λ) = λ. The dwelling of the I module P admits a local description, or in terminology [1] - [2] is plentiful if I = I (zi). Abundant durles and their properties play an important role in the spectral theory of operators and often find themselves a decisive factor, usually in a dual production, in the tasks of spectral analysis-synthesis, interpolation, in studies of the equations of packages, in the issues of weighted appendix with polynomials, exponential functions, etc. (see introduction to [1] - [2] and reviews [4], [5]). The closed windows I ⊂ p (topologically) is generated by the I1 submodules ,. . . , In, if I is a closure of many elements of the type I1 +. . . + in, where I1 ∈ I1 ,. . . , in ∈ in. We designate such a suburbs as ī (i1,., In). The closed windows of the I module P (topologically) is generated by the functions of the G1 ,. . . , gn ∈ I, if it coincides with the closure of the many elements of the type P1G1 +. . .+pngn, where P1 ,. . . , pn ∈ C [Z]; At the same time, the suburbs of I is called (topologically) norporiental. Based on software research I.F. Krasichkova-Ternovsky [1], [2] The tasks of the local description of the closed windows in the spaces of the holomorphic functions of one variable in this article are given sufficient conditions under which the closed windows I = ī (I1, I2), generated by a pair of abundant windows I1 and I2 and I2 also abundant. These conditions are formulated in the terms of the “proximity” of the sequences of zeros of the I1 and I2 undergraduates for a wide class of modules P, set as an inductive or projective limit of normalized weight spaces. The setting of the problem under consideration and the terms in which it is solved also proceed from I.F. Krasichkovaterenovsky. Of the and, apparently, the first conditions of this kind, we note the recent results of N.F. Abuzyarova [6] (§ 3) - [8], where for 2πperiodic ρ -trigonometrically convex (see [9]) a half -abede of the function h (θ)> 0, θ ∈ R, for modules of whole functions [ρ, h) with ρ> 0 (corresponding to [ρ, h] with ρ> 1) with an indicator in order ρ, strictly smaller H (θ) (corresponding to no less H (θ)), θ ∈ [0, 2π), sufficient The conditions for the proximity of sequences of the roots of two whole functions in which the closed windows generated by these two functions is plentiful. 281 § 1. The formulation of the main result is introduced into consideration of the weight modules of the holomorphic in the field of ω of functions set as an inductive or projective limit of normalized spaces. Such spaces, after an appropriate integral transformation, often act as the implementation of conjugated spaces to the weight spaces of the holomorphic functions in areas in C or to the spaces of functions on intervals in R. Let Q - a materially digit function in ω. Through PQ, we denote a normalized space consisting of all functions F ∈ H (ω) with the final norm ‖F‖ = SUP ζ∈P (ζ) | Exp Q (ζ). (1.1) Let q = {qn}, n ∈ N, - an increasing (comprehensive decreasing) sequence of materially digit functions to ω. Enter the locally convex space p ↑ q = ⋃ n> 1 pqn (corresponding to ↓ q = ⋂ n> 1 p
