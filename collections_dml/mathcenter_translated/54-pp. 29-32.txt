Lobachevsky 2 anis_59@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky in the article solves the problem of optimizing polynomial projection methods of solving periodic equations with the Weil fractional and integrated operator in the main part. For the class of regulary integrated equations of the fractional order set by the factors of the fixed class of Helder, the optimality of the accuracy of the accuracy of known methods is proved in a pair of gelderic functions: Galerkin according to the trigonometric system of functions, collocation of 30 materials of the International School-Conference and Plains on Equinimive Nodes. Hence, as a result, the optimality of these methods also follows in the corresponding class of integral equations with the Weil fractional and integrated operator in the main part. Key words: fractional -integral equation, projection method, polynomial approach, optimization in order of accuracy. To date, the task of optimizing in order of accuracy of direct and projection methods [1] has been solved for a number of classes of regular and singular integral equations. However, in the case of fractional -integrated equations, such a task has not yet been studied. The reason, apparently, is an incorrect setting on Adamar, the problem of solving such equations. We here give a solution to the optimization problem in order to accuracy for one class of periodic integrated equations with the Weil's fractional integral in the main part. The task of optimizing polynomial projection methods of solving the class of periodic fractional -integral equations of the type Kaper γ γ + 1 2π 2πˆ 0 ψα ± (x - t) onic (t) d t + 2π (x, t) С (t) d t = f. (x), −mm <x <mm, (1) where α (0 <α <1) is a given number, f (x), g (x, t)-known 2π-periodic functions, γ ∈R1 and ∗ -the desired numerical parameter and 2π-periodic function. The function is ψα ± (t) = 2 φ∑ k = 1 cos (kt ∓απ/2) Kα sets the fractional -integrated operator J, determined by the fractional integral of Weil (see, e.g., [2, p. 264]) of the order α) : Japer 1 2π 2πˆ 0 ψα ± (x - t) onic (t) d t. Let C ≡ c2π have the space of continuous 2π-periodic functions with a conventional Max-Norm ∥ · ∥c. We denote through haf (0 <δ ≤ 1) the space of 2π -periodic functions that satisfy the condition of the gelder with indicator Δ> 0, with the norm ∥ices ∥ices ∥ et (onic; Δ), where h (Сory; Δ ) - the smallest permanent Helder. Through H0, δ we will denote the subspace of the space haf of functions f (x), for which 2π 0 f (x) d x = 0. As you know (see, e.g., [2, p. 275]), with 0 <β <β <β <β <β 1–α Operator J isomorpho displays H0, β on H0, α+β. Therefore, we will further assume that β> 0 satisfies the condition α+β <1. Y.R. Agachev, A.F. Galimyanov 31 Grade E unambiguously permitted equations (1) We will set by classes: F = {F} Functions from Hλ, α+β <λ≤ 1 and g = {g} Functions from hλ × l1, limited in metric c × l1 absolutely positive constant m. We introduce two spaces into consideration: φ = h0, β × r1, f = hα+β. We set the norm inva with the formula ∥ware∥φ = | γ |+∥ç∥β, where onic = (onic; γ) &. We introduce into the consideration the operator j, determined by the formula J accord, onic, onic = (onic; γ) &. Then the equation (1) in a pair of spaces (φ, f) can be recorded in the operator form k accord (onic = (onic) €, f ∈ F). (1 ’) in [3] proved that in a pair of spaces (φ, f) the equation (1 ′) is correctly set along Adamar. Let PN have an arbitrarily fixed operator from the set of PN design operators f to fn = htn, where HTN is a lot of trigonometric polynomas of the order not higher than N, but φn = {onic = (ther; γn) ∈ Fn × R1}. Then the projection method of solving the equation (1 ′) from class E, determined by the operator PN, is set by the equation K nronic ≡ pNKovern = pn f (onic ∈φn, pn ∈Pn). (2) the solution (lus ∗, γ ∗) ∈ φ of the equation (1 ′) from class E will be approximated by the solutions (lus ∗ n, γ ∗ n) ∈__ of the equations (2) from class EN, determined by the multiple pn. At the same time, for the optimal assessment of the error of the class EN projection methods (2) in the class of E equations (1 ′) we will take the value [1, p. 40] vn (e) = inf pn etorn sup e] ∥ç ∗ −ware ∗ n∥φ. Consider the equation k ° niron ° n ≡ p #NKümpus = p sis f (uty °n ∈ photos, p than). (2 °) definition [1, p. 40]. If the element iry °n = (p #NK) −1p °n f, where p reach ∈Pn, satisfies the condition SUP {∥ices ∗ °N∥φ: e ∈ E} ≍VN (E), then the projection method (2 °) is called optimal in order among all
