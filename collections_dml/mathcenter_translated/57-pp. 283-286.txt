UDC 517.53 multiple interpolation in the classes of I.I. Privalova in the circle of E.G. RUDIKOVA1, V.A. Poor thing2 1 evheny@yandex.ru; Bryansk State University named after Acad. I. G. Petrovsky 2 Vera.Bednazh@mail.ru; Bryansk State University named after Acad. I. G. Petrovsky in the work solved the problem of interpolation on many multiple nodes in the classes of I.I. Privalova πq (q> 1) in a circle. Key words: interpolation, multiple nodes, classes of Privalov, analytical functions. Let C - a complex plane, D - a single circle on C, H (D) - many functions that are analytical in D. With all 0 <q <+φ, we determine the class of I.I. Privalova πq: πq = {f ∈ H (D): SUP 0 <r <1 2π ∫ π π − − − − (ln+ | f (r eiθ) |) q dison <+ φ}. Note that the classes ofπq at Q> 1 were introduced by I.I. Privalov in [5]. The monograph by V.I. is devoted to the study of some properties of these spaces. Gavrilova, A.V. Subbotina, D.A. Efimova [2]. If Q = 1, the class of Privalov coincides with the well -known class in the scientific literature by the class of R. Nevanlinne (see, for example, [4]). Case 0 <Q <1 in the scientific literature has been studied little. In this work, the issue of interpolation on many multiple nodes in classes in classes (Q> 1) is investigated. We formulate the task of multiple interpolation in the classroom of Privalov: let {zk} ger 1 and {wk} ger 1 - arbitrary sequences of complex sen from D; We denote through p j-the multiplicity of the appearance of Z J in the entire sequence {ZK} ger 1, S J ≥ 1-the multiplicity of the appearance of the number z J on the segment {zk} j 1. Obviously, 284 materials of the school-conference that 1 ≤ s j ≤ p j ≤+least. Under what conditions imposed on growth {zk} and the distribution of points WK can be built from class πq, such as F (SK -1) (ZK) = WK, K = 1.2,. . .? (1) The sequence {zk} in this case is called interpolation. In the event that SK = 1, the interpolation is carried out on many simple nodes {wk}. Note that a similar task in the classes of analytical functions with restrictions on the characterization of R. Nevanlinna was solved in the works [1], [6], [7]. The fundamental result in the theory of interpolation belongs to L. Carlese (see [8]). The task of interpolation, subject to the uniform separation of simple nodes in the classes πq (q> 1) was solved in the work [9]. We denote through b (z) the product with zeros at the sequence points {zk} ⊂ D, i.e. B (z) = +ger∏ k = 1 zk | zk | · ZK-z 1-zk z, bk (z)-a product for a plaque without a k-th factor. It is well known that the work B (Z) converges absolutely and evenly in D when and only when the condition is fulfilled +ger∑ k = 1 (1 - | zk |) < +least. The angle of the adit γδ (θ) with the top at point E Iθ is called the angle of solution πδ, 0 <δ <1, whose bisector coincides with the segment R eiθ, 0 ≤ r <1. The sequence of complex numbers {zk} +ger k = 1 ⊂ d that satisfies the condition of the plaque, as well as the conditions | BK (ZK) | ≥ EXP −µ (K) (1- | ZK |) 1 Q, for all 1 <Q <+inous, where µ (K)> 0, µ (K) = O (1), K →+urb, SUP K≥1 {pk} <+φ, we are attributed to the class ∆̃. For a given sequence {zk} ⊂ D and fixed 1 <q <+ φ, the space of sequences {wk} ⊂ D, for which ln+ | wk | = o ((1 - | zk |) −1/q), k →+urb, i.e. | wk | = Exp µ1 (k) (1 - | zk |) 1/q, (2) µ1 (k)> 0, µ1 (K) = O (1), K →+urb. Note that the class is L̃ Q, and with it, expression (2) are natural for solving the interpolation problem in the classes of I.I. Privalova πq (q> 1), due to justice of the next theorem: E.G. RADOKOVA, V.A. Poorness 285 Theorem 1. (see [2], p. 40). If f uction (q> 1), m (r, f) = max | z | = r | f (z) |, z ∈ D, then ln+ m (r, f) = o (1+ r 1 - r) 1/q, r → 1–0, and this assessment is accurate. The main result of the work is the evidence of the following statement: theorem 2. Let 1 <q <+inous; {zk}+φk = 1 - arbitrary sequence of complex numbers from D, in the final number of corners of the stall: {zk} ger 1 ⊂ n⋃ S = 1 γδ (θs) with some 0 <Δ <1. If {zk} Φ 1 ∈ ∆̃, then for any sequence {wk} φ1 ∈ L̃ Q (ZK), the function ∈ πq (q> 1), which is a solution to the interpolation problem (1) for all SK ≥ 1, can be built in an explicit form. Note that when proof of theorem, the methods of work were used [3] and [7]. The first author was supported by the Russian Fund for fundamental research (project 18-31-00180 LOT). Literature 1.
