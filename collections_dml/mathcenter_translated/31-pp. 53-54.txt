Dyomina PMA KBNC RAS, Nalchik, niipma@mail333.com in the area ωαβ = d × Jαβ, where D is a limited area of ​​RN points X with a piece of line -forating the border σ, jαβ: α <y <β, sαβ -boundary ωαβ, consider the equation of the mixed type Tu ≡ K (y) [aij (x) uxi] xj -uyy + c (y) k (y) u = 0 , (1) where k (y) ∈ C1 (J̄α0) ∩ c1 (J̄0β); aij (x), c (x) ∈ C (d̄), i, j = 1.2 ,. . . , n; yk (y)> 0 ∀ y 6 = 0; k ′ (y) ≥ 0, ∀ y ≥ 0; c (x) ≤ 0, aij (x) μiunk ≥ k0 | onic | 2 ∀ x ∈ D, ă rn; K0 = const> 0. 53 mixed task. Find the solution regular in the area ωαβ solution u (x, y) equations (1) from class C1 (ω̄αβ), which satisfies the conditions UY (x, α) = ∈ (x), ∀ x ∈ D; (2) uy (x, β) = wor (x), ∀ x ∈ D; (3) u (x, y) = ψ (x, y), ∀ (x, y) ∈ Sσ. (4) Similarly to the work [1] the following theorem has been proven. If sαβ, aij (x) and c (x) have the property that the system of own functions {vm (x)} corresponding to the own values ​​of λm of the homogeneous problem v | σ = 0 for the equation [aij (x) vxi] xj + [ c (x) + λ] v = 0, x ∈ D is full in the space L2 (D) and vm (x) ∈ C1 (d̄) ∩ c2 (d), m = 1, 2 ,. . . , then the task (1) - - (4) has no more than one solution and only when ω′M (β) 6 = 0 ∀m, where ω (y) is the solution of the equation ω′M (y) + λmk (y) ωm (y) = 0 from class C1 (J̄αβ), satisfying the condition ω′M (α) = 0.
