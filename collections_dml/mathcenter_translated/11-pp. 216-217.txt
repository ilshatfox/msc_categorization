) Solving the problem of the type of gurs for one B -Pseudopar of the Abolic equation by the Riemann function by the Riemann function, let D = {O <Z.: <X 1 • O <y1} - · rectangular region in the coordinate plane ohu. Consider the equation: l (u) = in, du + avhi + biu + cu = o, (1) where is a2 k a -k d k a vx = 8? +-{) = x 8 (x 8), k> about x-x x x x x-the constituent operator, a, b, s-functions from u. Consider the problem of the type of gurs: find the solution to the equation (1) in the region D, satisfying the boundary conditions IL: R = O = <P (y), (2) 216 HIS: O = O, ILU = O = TF1 (X). (3) (4) The equation of the type (1) we will call in - pseudo -paradlochia an equation. Together with the equation (1), we will also consider the equation l*(v) = -DX vy + dr (AV) - (b) y + cv = o, (5) which will be a related equation to the equation (1). The function R (: i ;, О; (, tj) is called the function of the Riemann if it is whirled by the following conditions: 1) R (x, y; (, 11) satisfies the equation (5) relative to the translated x, y; 2) R (o, y; (, 11) = EHR (d a (o, t) dt); 3) r.t (o, y; (, tj) = exp (Fl b (o, t) dt). It is not difficult to prove that if there is a function of gymnasi1., Then the problem of the problem (1) - (4) can be presented in the form: and (x, y) = rp (y) + -f '(x) r (x, o ; x, y) + + foy lf> (1j) r (o, tj; x, y) dtj +! ah tf1ioq ((, u; x, y) d (-rp (y) m (o, y; x, y) - · f (x) m (x, o; x, y)+ lf> (o) m (o, o; x, y), where m = r "+ b, k- 1r, q = Rxx +(kxk- 1r) " +((b-k (k- 1) xk- 2) r) y.
