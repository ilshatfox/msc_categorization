) The geometric description of the areas in which Hardy’s inequality is fairly the main result of the work is the solution of the well -known problem associated with the following variational inequality of Hardy in the flat area ω: ∫∫ ω | u | 2 Δ2ω dx dy ≤ c (ω) ∫∫ ω | gradu | 2DX DY, U ∈ CU0 (ω), where Δω is the distance from the point (x, y) ∈ ω to the boundary of this area. It is said that ω is the Hardy area, if there is a final constant C (ω), for which rightly indicated variational inequality. It is known that ω with the local -lipshitsky border is the area of ​​Hardy. There are a number of generalizations of this fact (see review [1]). However, the task of the geometric description of all the areas of Hardy remained unresolved. We prove the following statement. Theorem. The area ⊂ R2 is the area of ​​Hardy and only when ω is a uniformly perfect area. In conclusion, we note that uniformly perfect (Uniformly Perfect) are well known from a number of works on hyperbolic geometry, and for them there is a simple description of both the terms of Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry.
