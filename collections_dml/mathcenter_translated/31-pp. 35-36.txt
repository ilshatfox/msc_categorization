Classification of the algebrus of the Galonomy of the Lorentsev diversity A. S. Galaev Saratov State University, rector@ssgu.ssu.runnet.ru Classification of the algebra of the riman diversity of the riman diversity (AGRM) is a well -known classical result [1]. This work sets out the classification of the algebra of the Hydronomy of the Lorentsev diversity (AGLM). The algebra of the n + 2-dimensional diversity of diversity can be identified with the gaggra g ⊂ so (1, n + 1) (n ≥ 0). The theorem S. Wu and the results of M. Bergeta [1] allow us to consider only poorly irrelevant, which are not irrelevant (CH) Aglm G ⊂ SO (1, N + 1) (all such algebra G does not have its own invariant unbearable subspace in R1, N +1, but has an invariant isotropic line l ⊂ R1, n + 1, therefore G is found in parabolic subpassion SO (1, N + 1) L ⊂ SO (1, N + 1)). For Podalgebras g ⊂ so (1, n + 1), consider the space r (g) = {r ∈ Hom (∧2r1, n + 1, g) | r (u ∧ v) w + r (v ∧ w) u + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + R (w ∧ u) v = 0 for all u, v, w ∈ R1, n+1} tensors of curvature type G. Determination 1. Podalgebra G ⊂ so (1, n + 1) is called an algebra of a berge if span {r (∧2r1, n + 1) | r ∈ R (g)} = g. 35 from the Ambrose -Zinger Theorem [1] it follows that AGLM is an algebra Berge. In [2] SN-Podalgebras in SO (1, N + 1) were divided into 4 types, and with each such submarine, some Podalgebra H ⊂ SO (N) was associated. From the works [3] and [5] it follows that the SN of the Podalgebra G ⊂ SO (1, N + 1) is an algebra of the Berger and only when h ⊂ so (n) is agrm. To complete the classification of AGLM, it is necessary for each SN algebra Berger G to build an example of Lorentsev's diversity with the algebra of the Gunomy G. This is done in [4], where local metrics are built, giving the necessary homonomies. We give examples. For parabolic subpal geibra (1, n + 1) l ⊂ so (1, n + 1) we have the decomposition of Ivasawa SO (1, n + 1) l = (r ⊕ so (n)) n rn. SN AGLM of two types have the form: g1, h = (r) nrng3, h, onic = {(onic (a), a, x) | a ∈ H, x ∈ Rn}, where h ⊂ so (n) - AGRM, ∗ ∈ Hom (h, r), eed [h, h] = 0. Consider the metric on rn+2: g = 2dx0dxn+1+n∑ i = 1 (dxi) 2++2aαijkx jxk (xn +1) α - 11dxidxn+1+f (dxn+1) 2, where aαijk (i, j, k = 1,., N, α = 1,., N) - some numbers depending on H ⊂ so (n), and F is some function. For f = ∑n i = 0 (x i) 2 (corresponding, f = ∗αIxi (xn+1) α -1, where the numbers wor, i = 1,., N, α = 1,.., N , depend on the wor) the algebra of the dull of the metric G coincides with G1, H (corresponding, with G3, H, lus).
