SOME PROPERTIES OF MEANS OF BLOCH FUNCTIONS  1. Introduction and results. Let ∆ be the unit disc |z| < 1. For an analytic function f in ∆ we set  ‖f‖B = sup z∈∆  (1− |z|2)|f ′(z)|.  The Bloch class B is the set of all analytic functions f on ∆ for which ‖f‖B < ∞. The quantity |f(0)| + ‖f‖B defines the norm of the linear space B which equipped with this norm is a Banach space (see, e.g. [1], [12]).  351    The space B0 consists of all f ∈ B such that (1 − |z|2)|f ′(z)| → 0, as |z| → 0, and B1 consists of all f ∈ B such that if {zn} ⊂ ∆ and |f(zn)| → ∞ then (1− |zn|2)|f ′(zn)| → 0. Note that B0 ⊂ B1 ⊂ B.  Let S be the standard class of analytic univalent functions f in ∆ normalized by f(0) = f ′(0)− 1 = 0. For a ∈ ∆, let the Möbius mapping ϕa : ∆ −→ ∆ be given by the formula  ϕ(z) = ϕa(z) = e iθ a + z  1 + āz  where θ ∈ R. In [11] the notion of linearly invariant family was given as a class M of functions h(z) = z + · · · analytic and locally univalent in ∆ and satisfying the following condition:  for every Möbius mapping ϕ and every h ∈M the function  Fϕ(z) = h(ϕ(z))− h(ϕ(0))  h′(ϕ(0))ϕ′(0) = z + . . .  belongs to M. The number  ord h = sup{|F ′′ϕ(0)|/2 : ϕ is a Möbius mapping, ϕ(∆) = ∆}  we call the order of the function h. There are many interesting examples of linearly invariant families (see [11]).  The universal linearly invariant (or Möbius invariant) family Uα is the class of all functions h(z) = z + . . . analytic and locally univalent on ∆ such that ordh 6 α. Ch. Pommerenke [11] showed that Uα = ∅ for α < 1, U1 is the well known class of convex functions, and S ⊂ U2.  In [15] the second author introduced the following linearly invariant family of functions Uα′ ⊂ Uα.  Definition 1. The family Uα′ consists of all functions f such that  f ′(z) = exp [ −2  ∫ 2π 0  log(1− zeit) dµ(t) ]  , (1.1)  where µ(t) is a complex-valued function with bounded variation on [0, 2π) such that ∣∣∣∣ ∫ 2π  0  dµ(t)− 1 ∣∣∣∣ +  ∫ 2π 0  | dµ(t)| 6 α, α > 1. (1.2)  For many extremal problems in Uα extremal functions belong to Uα′. In [16] it was given the following  352    Definition 2. The family Uα∗ consists of all functions f such that there exist a convex univalent function s(z) = z + . . . (note that s ∈ U1 = U′1) and a Schwartz function ω (analytic in ∆, ω(∆) ⊂ ∆, ω(0) = 0) such that  f ′(z) = s′(z) exp [ −2  ∫ 2π 0  log(1− ω(z)eit) dµ(t) ]  , (1.3)  where µ(t) is a complex-valued function with bounded variation on [0, 2π) such that ∫ 2π  0  |dµ(t)| 6 α− 1, ∫ 2π  0  dµ(t) = 0. (1.4)  Uα∗ is a linearly invariant family of order α; Uα∗ ⊂ Uα. The families Uα∗ and Uα′ are not contained in each other for α > 1.  In [3] (see also [9]) it was shown that g ∈ B if and only if, there exists a function f ∈  ⋃ α<∞  Uα such that  g(z)− g(0) = log f ′(z). (1.5) A function g belongs to the space BMOA if g ∈ H1 and the boundary values of  g on the unit circle T belong to BMO(T), or equivalently, if the function g(ϕa(z))− g(ϕa(0)) belongs to H1 for every a ∈ ∆. The main properties of the space BMOA one can find in [2], [6].  Since BMOA * H.  it seems to be interesting to find the set of all functions f ∈ ⋃  α<∞ Uα for which  log f ′ ∈ BMOA. In the paper we give a partial answer to this problem. In the next theorem we give a relationship between the families Uα′, Uα∗ and  BMOA.  Theorem 1. i) f ∈ ⋃α<∞Uα′ =⇒ log f ′ ∈ BMOA; ii) f ∈ ⋃α<∞Uα∗ =⇒ log f ′ ∈ BMOA. Now we will prepare a ground for integral means in the Bloch space. For 0 < p < ∞ and analytic in ∆ function g we define  Ip(r, g) = 1  2π  ∫ π −π |g(reiθ)|p dθ, 0 < r < 1.  Clunie and MacGregor [4], and Makarov [10] proved the sharp estimate  Ip(r, f) = O((log 1  1− r ) p/2), r → 1,  353    for p ∈ (0,∞) and f ∈ B. What is known about the integral means of the derivatives of Bloch functions?  Girela [8] proved that if f ∈ B1, then  lim inf r→1  (1− r)2I2(r, f ′) = 0.  Moreover there exists a function f ∈ B such that  lim r→1  (1− r)2I2(r, f ′) > 0.  In this paper we characterize the integral means of functions from B0.  Theorem 2. For a given function ϕ(x) positive and (sufficiently slowly) decreasing with lim  x→∞ ϕ(x) = 0 there exists a function f ∈ B0 such that  lim inf r→1  (1− r)2I2(r, f ′) ϕ(− log(1− r)) = ∞.  Let us note that if f ∈ B0 and r → 1, then the expression (1 − r)2I2(r, f ′) can tend to 0 sufficiently slowly.  2. Proofs of results. Proof of Theorem 1. Let f be a function from a linearly invariant family M.  Then fa(z) =  f((z + a)/(1 + āz))− f(a) f ′(a)(1− |a|2) ∈ M,  for every a ∈ ∆. We have  log f ′a(z) = log f ′(  z + a  1 + āz )− log f ′(a)− 2 log(1 + āz).  Note that log(1 + z) ∈ BMOA (1 + z is univalent, and 1 + z 6= 0; see for example [2]). Since the function 1+ āz is subordinated to 1+z for every a ∈ ∆, by Littlewood theorem (see [5])  ‖ log(1 + āz)‖H1 6 ‖ log(1 + z)‖H1 , a ∈ ∆.  Thus we have the following inequality ∫ 2π  0  | log f ′( re iθ + a  1 + āreiθ )− log f ′(a)| dθ 6  ∫ 2π 0  | log f ′a(reiθ)| dθ+  +2  ∫ 2π 0  | log(1 + reiθ)| dθ.  354
