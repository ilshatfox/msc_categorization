) Greeting the OR seminar named after all participants in our seminar on the geometric theory of functions (Institute of Mathematics of the SB RAS, heads A.V. Sychev and cu. Aseev) I wish the successful work of the conference and congratulations to the leadership and participants of the city seminar L.A. AK Sentyeva with a jubilee date. The long -term fruitful activity of your seminar and its leader, Professor L.A. Aksen Tyeva, served as the formation and heyday of the Kazan school of the geomete of the ricical theory of functions, which continues to occupy one of the believing places in modern mathematics. We wish you successful continuation of your research work, further success in solving the fundamental problems of comprehensive analysis, both purely theoretical and applied nature. Let the galaxy of young talented researchers, brought up in the bosom of your seminar. N.N. Piven (eagle) memories of the scientific seminar of Professor L. A. Aksentyev Creating his scientific mathematical school - a long and time -consuming process, feasible, not any talented MAMM. In addition to the mathematical gift, you need to have great determination, pedagogical wisdom, and pain with patience and enormous hard work for this. To be able to inflate in each of his students from a small creative spark, to inflate a stable mathematical fire, so that these lights complement and strengthen each other and all together constitute one single unquenchable fire, more and more students would gather to the world. Being a forty-year-old young doctor of physicomatic sciences and professor at the department of differential equations of KSU, Leonid Alexandrovich Aksentiev dreamed of creating such a school. And so, after 40 years, we can proudly say that Ma thematic school L.A. Aksentieva is. I am sure that each of the students of Leonid Alexandrovich is grateful to God for bringing him to this amazing person, disinterested, honest and to self -forgetfulness to a devoted science. eight
