) New modifications of the concept of analytical capacity The concept of analytical capacity of sets plays a very pulmonary role in modern complex analysis. Along with the main analytical container (the capacity of Alfors), its modifications were also used, in the definitions of which the potato cyls with different types of measures were involved: complex, real or positive. The unifying for all these concepts was used (4 limited analytical functions. For the capacity of Alfors, it was the whole class of analytical in the field of C, Po C, Functions F (Z): LF (Z) I :: 1, F (OO) = Oh, and for the above modifications - subclasses of this class, with the functions represented by the potentials of the Cossack with certain measures. In the recent preprint of the young Izsky mathematician H. Tolsa [1], a sensational result on the equivalence of the capacity of Alfors and all of it was obtained the noted Modifi County. In [1], an extensive bibliography of works related to the development of these concepts and their applications is also given. In this lecture, we will deal with the new modifications of analytical - the functions that lie under the arbitrary ointment of 163 wounds, in that The time, as the majority unit was still with the majority.

Khromov (Saratov) The new idea of ​​Tikhonovsky regulators in [1] was shown that the area of ​​convergence of the method of regulatory of A.N. Tikhonov of the L-th order of smoothness [2] can be expanded to the entire space with [a, b] (i.e., Tikhonovskiy requirements1 additional smoothness for the exact solution of the studied equation can be removed). In this message, using the example of the task of approaching periods of periods of the reerusing operators, Tikhonov, it is expected that the indicated area of ​​convergence can be expanded to space C1 [a, b]. Consider on the segment [ -?
