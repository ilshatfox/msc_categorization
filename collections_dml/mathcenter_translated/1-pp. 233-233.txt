Changing the capacity of Roben during the polarization of the region1 Ka. Mishova G.N. The Saratov State University is designated through! 1 The finish area of ​​the extended complex plane C, contained by the OO and limited by smooth gordano crooked G1,., Gn. Let A, B - arbitrary closed ligaments, 8! 1 = and U V. Let, further, C, is a fairly large circumference lzl = r in! 1, surrounding the entire border, and P, is part P, lying in Cr. Through>. (A, CR) We denote the extreme length of the family of curves in ! 1 "Connecting A and C,. As you know, the capacity of Roben of the set and relatively! 1 calls the size b (a) = echr -e (a), where E (a) = lim. ,. .... 00 [27r>. (A, C,)-LOGR]. In the case of a = 8! 1, the Roben container of the set A coincides with the logarithm capacity (transfinite diameter) D (A). The capacity of Roben is a value that is invariant relative to conformal display with functions F, represented in the form of (1) in [1] proven that the capacity of Roben is the exact lower boundary of the distortion of the logarithmic capacity of the arbitrary multiple and when displayed with functions that are represented in the form (1), That is, d (f (a)) ~ b (a). The properties of the monotony of Roben's capacity are investigated in [2]. The use of symmetrization methods made it possible to solve a number of classes of the theory of functions of the complex alternating {See, for example, [3]). In this regard, the following question is of interest: how will the capacity of Roben of the set change and when polarizing the area n? Let the P - the area determined above, and the set and does not change from polarization; ! 1* - polarized area, 8! 1* = aub*; b (a) - the capacity of Roben of the set and relatively! 1; B*(a) - the capacity of Roben of the set A relative to P*.
