The independence of events in the non -communist theory of probability A.M. Bikchentaev, P.N. Ivanshin let ffic the trace on the algebra von Neumann a. Projectors, q ∈ A are called independent if onic (pq) = onic (p) onic (q). A general criterion for the independence of projectors has been obtained. The geometric criterion for the independence of the following pairs of projectors is given: 1) isoclinic; 2) One of the projectors is an algebra atom. The project r ≡ p∨q --p∧q is an analogue of the “symmetric difference” for a pair of projectors P and Q. If r ̸ = 0, i, pairs {p, r} and {q, r} are independent, then ∗ (p) = onic (q) = 1/2 and onic (p ∧q+p ∨q) = 1. In addition, if p IQ is independent, then ∗ (p ∧q) ≤ 1/4 and ∗ (p ∨q) ≥ 3/4. Examples of PA projectors P andQ are given, which 1) are of theoclinic and independent; 2) are unnowed and independent; 3) are not independent, but with independent {p, r} and {q, r}; 4) independent with independent {p, r} and {q, r}. For full matrix algebra, several equivalent conditions for the independence of projectors are given. Key words: Hilbert space, linear operator, projector, algebra von Neumann, trace state, independence. UDC 517.218.2 On the investment of the generalized spaces of Sobolev M pα (x) in the class of continuous functions in the critical case S.A. Bondarev1 1 bsa0393@gmail.com; Belarusian State University Let (X, D, µ) - a space of a homogeneous type with a doubling dimension γ. The article discusses the investment of the generalized spaces of Sobolev M p α (x) (p-display of summiness, α-smoothness indicator) in the class of continuous functions in so 70 materials of the school-conference called the critical case γ = αp. It is shown that with p ≤ 1, α> 0, any function from M p α (x) has a locally uniformly continuous representative under certain conditions for space (x, d, µ). Key words: analysis in metric spaces with a measure, Sobolev space. Let (x, d) - metric space with metric d. We denote through b (x, r) = {y ∈ X: D (x, y) <r} Open ball with the center at point X. Measure µ on X is called Borelevskaya, if the class µ-measured sets contains all the Borelev sets. We will only work with σ-addrative Borelev measures. Moreover, we will assume that the measure of any ball b ⊂ X is positive and finite. The three (x, d, µ) is called the space of a homogeneous type, if the metric and the measure are connected by the condition of doubling. This means that there is a positive constant airl that inequality µ (b (x, 2R)) ≤ aµ (b (x, r)) (1) is made for any ball B (x, r). The doubling condition can be written in quantitative form: there are constant γ> 0, C> 0, such that µ (b (x, r) ≤ c (r) γ µ (b (x, r)) (2) is performed For any x ∈ X and any 0 <r ≤ r. As γ, you can take log2 aµ. It is easy to see that at the same time inequality (2) turns out to be iteration (1). The numberγ plays the role of the dimension of the space (x, d, µ). The basic example of a uniform type space is RN with the Euclidean distance as a metric D and a measure of the Lebeg as a measure µ. Let α> 0 and 0 <p <mm. We determine the class of Sobolev M pα (x) in the metric space X. In order to do this, we will first introduce the concept of a α-grater. For the function f ∈ LP (x), we denote through Dα [f] the class of all non-negative µ-measured functions, such as the condition | f (x) - f (y) | ≤ [d (x, y)] α [g (x)+ g (y)] is made almost everywhere as they pay. Elements of Dα [f] will be called α-gratuents of the function f. We introduce the scale of the spaces of Sobolev m pα (x) m p α (x) = {f ∈ LP (x): dα [f] ∩lp (x) ̸ = ∅}. These spaces are normalized as follows (with p <1 we get a quasinorm): || f || m pα (x) = || f || lp (x) + inf || g || lp (x), Ya.V. Borisova 71 where the exact lower line is taken for all α-goraders of the function f. In the article by P. Hailash [1], the spaces m pα (x) at α = 1. It also shown that the MP1 (R N) space introduced in this way coincides with the classic space of Sobolev W P1 (R N) at P > 1, and as a α-gorad G, you can take the maximum function of Hardy-Littlwood from the usual gradient m | ∇ f |. The space (x, d, µ) will be called γ-regulatory in alphars, if there is such a constant C> 0 that C-1R ≤ ≤ midv is performed for any ball (X, R) ≤ Cr γ. We formulate the main theorem. With α = 1, this result was obtained in [2]. Theorem. Let γ = αp, 0 <α, 0 <p ≤ 1, and (x, d, µ) are γ-regulatory in alphars. If f ∈ M pα (x), then F has a locally evenly continuous representative. Moreover, for any ball b and any α-grater G ∈ Dα [f], the following inequality is SUP X, Y] f (x) - f (y) | ≤ ñ (∫ 2b g p dµ) 1/p. Literature 1. Hajlasz P.
