) Solving the problem of the mathematical theory of diffraction by the method of green potentials in the final region of the Euclidean space of the EP, limited hyperpost Lyalunova G: de = ER \ DI, the growing task of diffracia about finding solutions of equations (J = 1.2), respectively, in the areas of DI and DE that satisfy the conditions of the conjugation of the I AI: I AI; ------- = <p1, a1 onz a2 dnz and at infinity, I2 satisfies the conditions of radiation of the Merfeld zoma! IU2L 2DS'R = 0 (1), SL is known [1], if, h is not the values ​​of the conductor of Le and Neumann for the Laplace equation, then the internal and external tasks of the airship and Neumann for the Helmholu equation are one simply resolved. Therefore, under this condition, the functions of Green exist for these tasks. Let g1 (x, 0 and g2 (x, ~) - the functions of the Green, respectively, internal and external tasks, the conductor le, and n1 (x, o and n2 (x, ~) - the functions of the internal and external 154 tasks of the Neumann. Then the grip Potentials have the form WJ (x, 11) = j 11u 80a ~: · ~) dg, r vj (x, µ) = j µ (~) nj (x, () dg, g where 11 (~), µ ( ~) - · the density of potentials. We look for solving the problem of diffraction in the form (j = 1.2). Satisfying the conventions of the conjugation, we reduce the task of diffraction to one integral equation of Fredgolm of the second kind µ (() + l j µ (ry) k (, (,, ry) dg = p ((), where, \ - quite defined number. Ty. proved the unambiguous resolution of this integral equalization. Literature 1. Vladimirov V. S. equans: ul. Masta.
