Theories of elastic objects under the influence of mobile loads to the number of the most relevant and R. Problems of the dynamics of elastic systems are the problem of studying the dynamics of elements of structures when exposed to various kinds of moving, especially massive (inertial) loads. This kind of tasks arise in determining the interaction between the crew - bridges, roads, rails.; between aircraft and floating devices - gas and liquid; mobile policeman - mirrors; gas pipelines, oil pipelines - gas or oil; blood vessels - blood; mine Cana Tami - cells; various structures -united waves; airfields, airports - shock waves from excess of sound aircraft; Cleaning of the pipe cavity by the method of purging, etc. D. The mobile load models the load as a load distributed in the area and moving at a certain speed in some way. D, the general case takes into account the inertia of structures and the effect of the mass of the moving environment. In view of the locality of the distribution of loads on geometric and temporary coordinates, various types are attracted to their assignment. generalized functions. Difficulties in calculating objects in the presence of mobility for a truck, moments, are many times compared to the volume of static calculations. Particularly large mathematical difficulties arise when taking into account massiveness (inertia) drifting loads. New phenomena inherent only to dynamic systems carrying mobile elements are called, sometimes even inexplicable at the moment. The analysis of the following sections is given here: 1. Beams, suspended ropes under the influence of moving loads; 2. plates of various shapes and thicknesses; 3. cylindrical shells (thin and medium thickness); 4. Spherical shells (thin and medium thickness); 294 5. Conicorful membranes; 6. Temperature membranes; 7. Classification of research methods. 295
