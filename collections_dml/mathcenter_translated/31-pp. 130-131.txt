. Some diversity of the algebrian Leibrus with whole exhibits S. M. Ratsev Ulyanovsk State University, www.ulsu.ru The characteristic of the main field is zero. In the recording of the elements, the brackets are lowered during their lefton -in -armed arrangement, that is, ABC = ((AB) C). Legebra Leibniz are determined by the identity (xy) z = (xz) y + x (YZ) and are generalizations of algebrus Lee. For arbitrary diversity V exponential growth of the dimensions of the PN (V), the concepts of the lower and upper exhibitors are introduced: EXP (V) = Lim N → least √ Dim Pn (V), EXP (V) = LIM N → ger N √ DIM PN (V). If these two numerical values ​​coincide, then it is EXP (V). 131
