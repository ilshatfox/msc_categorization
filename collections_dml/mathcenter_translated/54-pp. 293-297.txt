Halon1 1 polovinkin.es@mipt.ru; The Moscow Physics and Technical Institute in the study of non-alcohol continuous functions F: x → R1 at a local minimum or maximum at some point x0 ∈ X The necessary extremum takes the type of inclusion: 0 ∈ ∂C F (X0), where ∂C F (x0) means Clark subdifferendal. In the more complex tasks of the mathematical theory of management, there is also the need to calculate subdifferents of the type of Clark subdifferendal. However, the calculation of these subdifferiors for non -loading and non -fuel function itself is not a simple task. This report revealed a fairly wide class of non-core functions, which we called poorly regular functions for which the formulas for calculating various derivatives in directions were obtained, and with them subdifferiors, including the subdifferendums of Clark, Michelle-Peno and others. In particular, this allows you to calculate subdifferents for functions presented in the form of a difference of two local lipshit convex functions. Keywords: Non -hot analysis, convex function, poorly regular function, derivative of directions, Clark subdifferendal. Let X - the actual banakh space. Through BR (x0). = {X ∈ X | ∥x - x0∥ <r} We denote an open ball with a center at point X0 radius R> 0 in space X. For any function f: x → R1, we determine the set of Dom f: = {x ∈ X | f (x) ̸ = ger}. 294 Materials of the International School-Conference as usual, the classic derivative of the functions f: x → R1 at point x0 ∈ F in the direction U ∈ X is determined from the expression f ′ (x0, u): = lim λ ↓ 0 λ-1 (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f (f x0 +λu) - f (x0)). We also consider the following definitions of the M-production for local lipsit function F: x → R1 at point x0 ∈ F in the direction of U ∈ X, where the index m is selected from the set {u, l, c, al, mp}, index "u" denotes the upper derivative [1, 2, 5], the "L" index - the lower [2, 5], the index "C" - the Clark derivative [1.2], the "Al" index - asymptotically lower [4.5], index, index. "MP" is a derivative of Michelle-Peno [3, 5]. Thus, we obtain a definition 1. Each m-production (where m ∈ {u, l, c, al, mp}) functions f at point x0 ∈ F in the direction U ∈ X are determined by the following expressions d+u f (x0) (x0) (x0) (x0) (x0) (x0) u): = liminf λ ↓ 0 λ - 1 (f (x0 +λu) - f (x0)), d +l f (x0) (u): = limsup λ ↓ 0 λ - 1 (f (x0 +λu ) - f (x0)), d +c f (x0) (u): = limsup λ, x: λ ↓ 0, x → x0 λ - 1 (x +λu) - f (x)), d +Al F (x0) (u): = sup worn (d+l f (x0) (u+w) - d+l f (x0) (w)), d+mp f (x0) (u ): = SUP worn {limsup λ ↓ 0 (λ - 1 (f (x0 +λ (u +w)) - f (x0 +λw))}}. Determination 2.M-Subdifferentilledfunction F: x → R1 Sepa of X0 ∈ DOM F (for any index m ∈ {C, MP, Al}) many from the conjugated space x ∗, defined by the formula ∂+m f (x0): = {p ∈ X ∗ | 〈P, x〉 ≤ d+m f (x0) (x) ∀x ∈ X}. Lemma 1. Let F: X → R1 - Locally Lipshitz at point x0 ∈ Dom F function. Suppose that for all U ∈ X there are finite classical derivatives in directions at point X0, i.e. F ′ (x0, u) = d+l f (x0) (u) = d+u f (x0) (u), ∀u ∈ X. ThenM-production+m f (x0) (u) form ∈ {mp, al} coincide with all U ∈ X, and the formula d+m f (x0) (u) = sup worn (f ′ (x0, is valid. u +w) - f ′ (x0, w)). Theorem 1. Let the function F: Br (x0) → R1 such that there are two continuous convex functions F1, F2: Br (x0) → R1 such that F (x) = f1 (x) - f2 (x) for all x ∈ Br (x0), and for some U ∈ X, one of the functions fk, k ∈ 1.2, satisfies the condition f ′ k (x0, u)+ f ′ k (x0, −u) = 0 (for example, if if The function is differentiated by GATO at the point of E.S. Polinkin 295 x0). Then for this U ∈ X and for all m ∈ {C, MP, Al}, M-productionD+M F (X0) (U) coincide, and the following formula d+m f (x0) (u) = f ′ is valid. 1 (x0, u)+ f ′ 2 (x0, −u). Determination 3. For the continuous function F: Br (x0) → R1, which has a final classical derivative in all directions at point x0 ∈ X, we determine the functions G and wor by the formulas G (x): = f (x0): = f (x): = f (x) x0)+ f ′ (x0, x −x0), onic (x): = f (x) - g (x). (1) Thus, the function F in the vicinity of BR (X0) points X0 is represented as the sum of its quasilinear part G and o-small residue ∗. It is obvious that the functions G and ffic in point X0 have the final classic derivatives in directions, and, in addition, the equality of G ′ (x0, u) = f ′ (x0, u), ship (x0, u) = 0 ∀ are true. u ∈ X. Moreover, the following inequalities d+c f (x0) (u) ≥ d+al f (x0) (u) = d+al g (x0) (u) (u) = d+c G ( x0) (u) ≥ f ′ (x0, u), d+mp accord (x0) (u) = 0, of which, in particular, the inequality is 0 ≤ D+c accord (
