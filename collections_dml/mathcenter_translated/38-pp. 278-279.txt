The problem of continuing unlimited measures on orthoprojectors let M - Algebra von Neumann. We denote through MPR and M+ the classes of all orthoprojectors and positive operators (respectively) in M. Let 1 - the identical operator from metro station 1. The family J with MRI is called the ORTO ideal in MPR if the conditions are Q ~ p e j, q. E MRI => q e j, p, q e j, pq = o => p + q e j. Determination 2. Conductive measure in orthoid ale j with mpr is called the display µ: j ----> Jr+, satisfying the condition p, qej, pq = o => µ (p+q) = µ (p)+µ (q). Determination 3. The measure µ is called semi-editing, if there is a set (p (}) AEA C J, such that p0 / 1. Determination 4. Weight on the algebra von Neumann M calls the display <p: m+ ----- -> [o, +oo], possessing its own stsi <p (x +y) = <p (x) +<p (y), <p (lh) = l <p (x) (x, y, – ,>. ~ O), M. R. Timirshin 279 At the same time, it comes up, 'that О · OO = O. In the work [1] an unlimited semi-inferior of the endsive measure on orthoprojectors was built, not continuing until weight. [2j, the author developed other scenes, we constructing unlimited semi-endless end-and-and-in-law measures on orthoprojectors that are not continuing to the weight, and in a clear form. In theorem 1, an analogue of these result was obtained for semi-pointed endsive measures in the orthoid ajja. On Theorem 2 The possibility of continuing of of of of the endsive measures on orthoids until the weight is additionally (1). Theorem 1. For any cardinal 'number n ~ 2, algebra von Neumann type is In and the nolo-olon, the finish-addusive measure µ: j:-> ~+ on this algebr'l orthoidal, not continuing until weight. Theorem 2. empty m - algebra von Neumann, which does not have a component ~ x type 12, and µ: j -> r_+ - a final -addusive measure in orthoidal, such, 'that p, q e j :::? P v q e j. (1) then 11 continues until the weight r.p: m + -> [o, + OS!]. ':., ". Literature 1. Lugovaya G. D., Sherstnev A. N. Op the ExtePsiopa ROOL IPUIPDDDE TEASURAS OP Projectiops // Math.
