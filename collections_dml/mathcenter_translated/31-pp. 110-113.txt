. The fundamental solution of one degenerating elliptical equation of A. M. Nigmedzyanov Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University Let E+P-the semi-space XP> 0 P-Minor Euclidean points of points X = (X ′, XP), X ′ = (X1, X2 ,. ., XP -1). In E + P, we consider the degenerate elliptical equation EM [u] = p --1∑ j = 1 ∂2u ∂x2j + xmp ∂2u ∂x2p = 0, (1) where m> 4, p ≥ 3. Let n = (m - 2)/2. Equation (1) in the characteristic coordinates M m - 2ising −1 p ∂u ∂ perf = 0, (2) the solution of which is looking for in the form U = oring - 1/NP v, where V is a new unknown. By substituting this function in the equation (2), we obtain relatively V of the next equation ∂2V ∂ă + ∂2V ∂ 12v22 + · · · + ∂ 2V ∂ME2P + m - 4 m - 2ă p ∂V ∂MP = 0. ( 3) It is clear that 0 <m - 4 m - 2 <1 at m> 4. By replacing the transplants by formulas x̃j = ă, j = 1, p - 1, x̃p = n edge/np equalization 111 (3) It is leaded to the type of X̃m -4P p - 1 j = 1 ∂2u ∂x̃2j + ∂2u ∂x̃2p = 0. It is known [1] that the fundamental solution of this equation with a feature at point x̃0 has the form ẽ (x̃, x̃0) = a (ρ̃21) 1 --P/2–β (1– σ̃) 1–2β × × [σ̃1 --p/2f (1– β, 2 - p 2 - β, 2 - p 2; σ̃) × γ (2- 2β) γ (p/2– 1) γ (1– β) γ (p/2– β) + γ (2–2β) γ (1– p/2) γ (1– β) γ (2- p/2- β) f (1- β, p/2– β, p/2; σ̃)], where σ̃ = ρ̃2 ρ̃21, β = m - 4 2 (m - 2), ρ̃2 ρ̃21} = p - p - p - p - p - p - p - p - p - p - p - p - p - 1∑ j = 1 (x̃j - x̃j0) 2 +n -2 (x̃np ∓ x̃np0) 2. Returning to the variable X, we have E (x, x0) = A (2 --m 2) 4/(M -2) (xpxp0) (ρ21) 1–β -p/2 (1– σ) 1–2β × × × × × × × × × × [σ1 --P/2 γ (2–2β) γ (1 - p/2) γ (1- β) γ (p/2– β) f (1– β, 2 - p 2 - β, 2– p 2; σ) + + γ (2–2β) γ (1 - p/2) γ (1- β) γ (1 - p/2– β) f (1– β, p 2 - β, p 2; σ)], where σ = ρ2 ρ21, ρ2 ρ21} = p - 1∑ j = 1 (xj - xj0) 2 + n - 2 (x --np ∓ x -np0) 2. It is easy to check that E (x, x0) = o (xn (p -2)+m/2p) xp → 0, 112 e (x, x0) = o ((ρ20) −1 - p/2 - m /m/ [2 (m - 2)]) with r = √ x21 +. . . + x 2 p → ∞. With the help of a number of Gauss, the decomposition of functions (1- σ) 1–2β and (1 + n2ρ2 (xpxp0) n/4) –β with small values ​​ρ in the steppe row, we will write the fundamental solution in the form of e (x, x0) = ẽ (x, x0) + e ∗ (x, x0), where ẽ (x, x0) = a γ (2–2β) γ (p/2– 1) γ (1– β) γ (p/2– β ) × × (2 - m) m/(m - 2) 4 (xpxp0) m/4 (ρ2) 1 --P/2, e ∗ (x, x0) - regular part of the fundamental solution E (x, x0).
