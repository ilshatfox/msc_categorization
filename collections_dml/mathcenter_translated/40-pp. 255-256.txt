The computing numberings in the Hershov hierarchy in the work considered the computable numbering of the celebrations of the sets of various classes: E; 1 Hierarchy Ershov. Let A E O. show that there is an endless family: E; 1 -many with the only E; 1 -calculated number. The computable family was also built: E; 1 -many without E; 1 -calculated Friedberg numbering. 256 E. M. Oshmarina, A. R. Urakov, G. and. Fedorova in the work announced the theorem. There is E; 1 -Ochuslima. I Frudbergov Well, the measurement of all E; 1 -many. The work was carried out under the financial sub-holder of the RFFI (about the ECT 08-01-00336) and the Presidential Program "Leading Scientific School of the Russian Federation" {Project NSh-3606.2010. one) .
