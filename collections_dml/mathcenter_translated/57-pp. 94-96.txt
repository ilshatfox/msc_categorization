Materials of the School-Conference of UDC 519.642 to the approximate solution of integrated equations of the third kind with motionless features in the nucleus of N.S. Gabbasov1, Z.Kh. Galimova2 1 gabbasovnazim@rambler.ru; Naberezhnye Chelninsky Institute of Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 Zulshik@mail.ru; Kazan Innovative University named after V.G. Timiryasova, Naberezhnye Chelninsky branch studies a linear integral equalnetthetic genus with motionless effectiveness in the nucleus. For its approximate solution in the space of generalized functions, a special version of the collocation method is proposed and justified. Key words: integral equation of the third kind, space of generalized functions, close solution, collocation method. The linear integral equation of the third kind with motionless features in the nucleus (utrno) is Ax ≡ x (t) l∏ j = 1 (t - t j) m j + 1∫ −1 k (t, s) [(s +1) p1 (s +1) P1 1 - s) p2] −1 x (s) d s = y (t), (1) where t ∈ I ≡ [−1,1], t j ∈ (−1,1), m j ∈N (j = 1 , l); K and Y are the well-known “point-gang” functions, X is the desired function, and the integral is understood in the sense of the final part according to Adamaru [1, p. 144 - 150]. Equations of the form (1) are increasingly used, both in theory and in applications (see, e.g., [2] and bibliography to it). Especially relevant is the development of effective methods of their approximate solution with the corresponding theoretical justification. A number of results in this direction were obtained in the work [2-5], in which special direct methods for solving Utrno (1) in a certain space D generalized functions built using the Delta-Function of Dirac are proposed and substantiated. This work is devoted to the issues of resolution of utrno (1) in a certain space V generalized functions generated by the functionality “The final part of the integral by Adamaru”. It is precisely, the generalized variants of “polynomial” and “spelled” direct methods have been developed, specially adapted to the approximate solution of the equation (1). Their justification is given in the sense [6, ch. 1] and it was established that the constructed methods are optimal in order of accuracy in some class F “smooth” functions among all direct projection methods of solving the studied equations. In the form of illustration, we give some of the results. Let C {m; 0} and C {p; 1}-the corresponding spaces of “point-clawed” functions, and t: c {m; 0} → c and s: c {p; 1} → c-respectively, their ” Characteristic "operators (see, e.g., [3]). We form the main space y ≡ {y ∈C {m; 0} | t y ∈C {p; 1}} N.S. Gabbasov, Z.Kh. Galimova 95 and on it we introduce the vector space x ≡ v (p) {0} generalized functions X (t) type X (t) ≡ z (t)+ m - 1∑ = 0 γi p.f.f.t −i - 1, where t ∈ I, Z ∈ C {P; 1}, γI ∈ R are arbitrary constant, and P.F.T -K - generalized functions defined on Y according to the following rule: (P.F.T -K, Y) ≡ P.F. ∫ 1 −1 y (t) t --k d t (y ∈ Y, k = 1, m) (the P.F. sign indicates the final part of the integral by Adamaru). According to the relevant norms, Y and X will be banal. Let it be specified by URNO (1). For the sake of simplicity of calculations and formulations, we will consider L = 1, T1 = 0, P1 = 0, i.e. Consider the equation of the type Ax ≡ t m x (t)+ 1∫ −1 k (t, s) (1– s) −p x (s) d S = y (t ∈ I), (2) where m ∈ N, p ∈ R+, Y ∈ Y, the nucleus K satisfies the conditions of the Fredgolmovity of the operator A: X → Y, and x ∈ X - the desired generalized function. We look for its approximate solution in the form of xn ≡ xn (t; {c j}) ≡ (1– t) p n+1∑ i = −1 ci bi (t)+λ∑ i = 0 ci+n+2 (t - 1) I+m-1∑ i = 0 ci+λ+n+3t −i-1 (n = 2.3, ...), (3) where BI (t)-ordinary B-lumines of the third order on A uniform grid with nodes sk ≡−1+ 2k/n (k = 0, n), a λ = λ (p) ≡ [p] - (1+ si g n ([p] −p)). Unknown parameters c j = c (n) j (j = −1,0.1, ..., n +m +λ +2) we find, according to our method, from SLAU (STρn) (Si) = 0 (i = 0 0, n), (tρn) {j} (1) = 0 (j = 0, λ), ρ {i} n (0) = 0 (i = 0, m −1), (stuxn) (3) (sk −0) = (stuxn) (3) (sk +0) (k = 1, n −1), (4) in which ρn (t) ≡ (axn - y) (t) is an unhealthy solution, Ug ≡ t m g (t). Remark. Reduction of the computing algorithm (2)-(4) is carried out using the appropriate ideas and results of work [3], [6, ch. one]. Moreover, if the initial data of the Utryno (2) belong to the class y c (r) ≡ {y ∈ Y | ST y ∈C (r)} (r = 1.3), then in conditions of the values ​​of the reasoning the approximate solutions X ∗ N to the exact The solution X ∗ = A -11Y is characterized by inequality ∥x ∗ n −x ∗x = o (n --r) (r = 1.3).
