The envelope of the family of planes in the projective space of O. M. Khrustalev Kaliningrad, olesya@epc.albertina.ru In the projective space PN, the R-Mortal Family BR (1 6 r <(m + 1) (n-m)) M-Merular planes LM (1 6 m <n). A specialization of the mobile rapper {a, AA, AA, AA, in which the vertices A, AA are placed on the plane of LM, and the indices accept the values: A, B, C = 1, M; α, β, γ = m + 1, n. The system of equations of the BR family in a parametric form has the form ωα = λαi θ i, ωαa = λ α aiθ i, where θi are the basic forms set in a certain area of ​​the Rmeric space of the parameters of SR. Theorem 1. Equipping the on -board of the BR family induces projective connectivity in the associated stratification of projective reperns [1]. The existence of the envelope surface of the original family is established. For this, the characteristic point b = a+µAaa and its differential are considered on the LM plane, which leads to the M (N -M) system of linear heterogeneous equations with m unknowns µA: –µAλαai = λαi. The study of this system allows us to draw the following conclusion. 166 Theorem 2. If the family of BR of LM planes coincides: a) the rank of matrix (λαai) and the expanded matrix (λ α āi), where the index ā = (0, a), and a pair of indices (αi) numbers lines; b) the dimension of the BR family and the LM plane forming, then there is an M-dimensional surface (b), envelope BR. Let BM be a family that has an envelope (b). It was shown that when placing points B, the stratification of projective repera, associated with the BR family, is reduced to the stratification of centroprophytical reperns. At the same time, the equipment of the Bortolotti family of BM planes is the equipment of the cartan of the envelope of the envelope (b) [2]. Theorem 3. Normalization of Norden of the envelope of the surface (b) induces centroprojecting connectivity in the associated stratification of centro -projects. Comment. Equipping the surface of the surface (b), generally speaking, does not inducing centro -projecting connectedness. L and T R A T R A 1. Zhovtenko O. M.
