Through ω+ and ω - we denote the parabolic and hyperbolic parts of the mixed area ω, → c (ω̄ -) - specified linear limited operators, a ≡ λ = const, f1 (x, y) ∈ C (ω̄+), f2 (x, y) ∈ C (ω̄ -). By the regular solution of the equation (1), we call the function u (x, y) ∈ C (ω̄) ∩c1 (ω) ∩c2 (ω \ i), satisfying the equation (1) in ω+ ∪ ω–.

On the Hausdorfoi schedules of a certain class of quite geodetic editions G.V. Chubarov Nizhny Novgorod State University, gvchub@mail.nnov.ru important invariants of the placement are its groups of the derman. The group of the derman γ (l, x) of layer l at point X, generally accepted in the theory of breakdowns, is formed by sprouts in the x -high -on diphteromorphisms along the hinges lying in this layer of L. These groups of the derman are local-global in nature: global in the layer and local in transversal to this layer. The sprout group of homeshonomy characterizes the behavior of this layer relative to other layers close to it. 169 The concept of the grouping group of Planning was introduced by Eresman. Winkelcemper proposed another, equivalent design, calling it a schedule. It is based on the concept of a sprout group of a derman. Groupdoid Gronomy G (F) of smooth formation (M, f) is (n + q) is a diversity where n = Dimf, Q = CODIMF, which, generally speaking, is not Hausdorfov. Conn built C ∗-algebras of integrated functions at the Gangsome Group Group G (F). This allowed him, the scandalis and a number of other mathematicians to apply non -commutative geometry to the breakdown, avoiding work with the “poor” space of the layers M /F. In most articles that use the grouping of the headonomy or layering graphics, their Hausdorfice is supposed. The aim of this work is to study the ratio between the Hausdorf and non -hutsdorphic sites obtained by the superstructure of homomorphism ρ: π1 (b, b0) → Diff (T). Such fits introduced by a hefliger [1], we call suspensed and denote (m, f) = sus (t, b, ρ) [2]. Suspended Planning (M, F) allows Rimanov to the metric G, relative to which all layers are quite geodetic submarous varieties of Rimanov's diversity (M, G). Thus, suspensed layers form a subclass of quite geodetic sites. We have received the following criterion for the Hausdorfovo schedule of suspensed laying. Theorem 1. In order for the schedule g (f) of laying (m, f) = = sus (t, b, ρ) to be Hausdorfov, it is necessary and sufficient for the group ψ: = ρ (π1 (b, b0))) quasi -aanalytic group of diphteromorphisms of variety t. Based on the theorem 1 and the criterion of isomorphism of suspensed fits [2], the author and N. I. Zhukova constructive 170
