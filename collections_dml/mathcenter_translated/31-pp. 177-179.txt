The stratification of Weil V.V. Shurygin (ml.) Kazan State University, vadimjr@ksu.ru Let a - Algebra Weil. We denote the symbol of MF the category of smooth diversity, and the symbol of the FM is the category of stubborn spaces. The algebra A associate the TA: Mf → FM function, called the Veil function, which relates to the smooth diversity m its stratification of Weil πa: Tam → M [1]. We will assume that algebra A is Frobenius, i.e., an unexplored bilinear form Q: A × A → R is set to the following associative condition: Q (XY, Z) = Q (X, Y Z) for any X, Y, Y, Y Z ∈ A. Form Q determines the Frobenius Coicator P: a → R by formula p (x) = q (x, 1a), where 1a is a unit of algebra A. Let L - an endless module above a and t: l ×. . . × l → a-a-digit covariant tensor. Definition [2]. The implementation of the tensor T is called the material tensor R (t): = p ° t: l ×. . . × l → R. Let M-M-Merged smooth diversity. The stratification of Weil TAM is a M-dimensional A-grinding diversity, and at each point X ∈ TAM the tangent space of TXTAM is an M-dimensional A-module [2, 3]. Let ă ∈ ω ∗ (m) - the differential form on m and lection ∈ ising (TAM) - its analytical continuation [3]. Determination. Complete elevator hole of differential form ă will call the form lection: = R (hole) on TAM. Theorem 1. Let M - smooth diversity, tam - its stratification of Weil. A full elevator of external forms induces the 177 Momorphism of claws de Ram H ∗ DR (M) 7– → H ∗ DR (TAM), [cil] 7– → [lection]. (1) Theorem 2. Let A - Frobenius Algebra Weil, P - Frobenius Coicator on A and M - smooth diversity. If P (1a) 6 = 0, then homomorphism (1) is isomorphism. If P (1a) = 0, then homomorphism (1) is zero.

The task of the conductor for the ordinary differential equation of the second order with the continued derivative of the B. I. Efendiev PMA KBNC RAS, Nalchik, niipma@mail333.com will consider the equation U ′ ′ λ λD [α, β] 0x u (t) = f (x), x ∈ (0, 1), (1) where α, β, λ = const, α <β, 0 <β <1, d [α, β] 0x u (t) is a continued derivative segment order [α, β], determined 178 as follows [1], [2, p. 33]: D [α, β] 0x U (t) ≡ β∫ α d γ 0xu (t) dγ, where dtaxu (ă) is the operator of the fractional integro-raditory of the Riemann-Lyuville of the order [2, p. nine]. In this paper, an analogue of the Green Function method has been built for the Dirichle task for equation (1) and a general representation of the solution was obtained. The existence of the solution of the problem of the conductor in the case of a positive spectral parameter has been proven and the conditions of existence were found in the case of a negative spectral parameter. Task. Find the solution u (x), x ∈ [0, 1] equations (1) from class C [0, 1] ∩ c2 (0, 1), satisfying the regional conditions U (0) = u0, u (1) = u1 , (2) where U0, U1 are constants. Theorem. Let f (x) ∈ L [0, 1]. 1) if λ> 0, then the task of the conductor (2) for equation (1) has the only solution; 2) If λ <0 and the condition x - λ λ 1 0 (1– ă) r (ă) dran 6 = 1 is fulfilled, where r (hole) is the nucleus resolvent k (ă, t) = ∫ β β -2 α- 2 (cil - t) −η - 1 γ (–η) dη, the task of the airship (2) for equation (1) has the only solution.
