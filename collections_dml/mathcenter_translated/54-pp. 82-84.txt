UDC 517.95 Theorems of Lyuville type for the stationary equation of Ginzburg-Landau and the elliptical inequality of a special species on model lipshitsky diversity C.S. Vikharev1 1 S.Viharev@volsu.ru; Volgograd State University, the Institute of Mathematics and Information Technologies found the conditions for fulfilling Lyuville theorems on the triviality of limited solutions to the elliptical inequality of a special species, as well as the inpatient equation of Ginzburg-Landau on model lipshitsky diversity. Keywords: Lipshitsev diversity, a stationary equation of Ginzburgdalandau, Lyuville type theorems. The work is devoted to the existence of positive decisions of the stationary equal equation of Ginzburg-Landau and the elliptical inequality of a special species on the so-called model lipshitsky diversity. We describe them in more detail. Consider the Lipshitz variety MG, isometric to a direct work R+ × S (where R+ = (0,+ urb), and S - compact lipsitz variety without edge) with metric: D S2 = DR 2+ G 2 (R) Dθ2. C.S. Vikharev 83 here G - continuous in lips, non -positive on R+ function. Let N = Dim Mg also. Consider on the MG the inpatient case of the well -known equation of Ginzburglandau −∆u = c (x) f (u), (1) where f (0) = f (a) = 0 for some a> 0, f (u)> 0 on ( 0, a) and f (u) <0 on (a,+∞), C (x) - a positive function. By solving equation (1) on Mg, we understand the function continuous in the lips of the function of such that for any set ω ⊂ mg and for any positive function φ (x) ∈C 10 (ω), ˆ ωu ·u ∇u ∇u ∇φd x = ˆ is performed Ω c (x) f (u) φ (x) d x, where ∇u is a gradient of function u. Let 0 <c1 <c (x) <c2 <mm, f (s) - Lipshitseva on [0, a]. Theorem 1. Let the following conditions be fulfilled: 1. There is a constant Q> 1, such that limsup ρ → ρ 2 Q -1  2ρ/4 g n -1 (r) DR ρ/2 g n n n. −1 (r) DR   1 q - 1 mm̂ 2ρ d s g n - 1 (r) =+urb. 2. There are constants Δ (q)> 0 and σ (q, δ)> 0 in which F (Δ) is F (S) êσSQ for all S ∈ (0, Δ). Then any solution to the equation (1), satisfying the condition 0 é u é a, is an identical constant. In the process of proof of theorem 1, we needed to formulate and prove Liuvillevo a property for the next elliptical inequality: −∆u ê uq, q> 1, (2) in the external region of MG, namely on the set ωe = {x = (r, θ) ∈ M: R> 1}. By solving inequality (2) on the set ωe, we mean the function continuously in the lips of the lips of such that for any set ω̃ ⊂ωe and for any positive function φ (x) ∈C 10 (ω̃) is performed ˆ ω̃ ∇u · ∇φd x ê ˆ ω̃ uq φ x, where ∇u is a gradient of the function U. 84 Materials of the International School-Conference of Theorem 2.

Then any non -negative solution to inequality (2) on the latest zero is. The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (project No. 15-41-02479r_POLZHEY_A). Literature 1. Losev A. G.
