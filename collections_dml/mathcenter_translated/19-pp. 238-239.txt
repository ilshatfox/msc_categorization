) The quadratic method of solving the singular integral equation of Hilbert, let it be a given mesh of the nodes. (1) trigonometrically: \ 1 mesh degree of defect 1 on [to, t 11] is the function T: [to, t 11] --t R, such that 1) those CR-L [to, fp], 2 ) Those t [t;, t;+ 1], i = 0, p - 1, where {span {l, sin t, cos t, ..., Sin mt, cos mt}, 1 · = 2m ; t "= {t. t (1) · (1)} 2 1 span cos 2, ssh 2, ..., cos t + 2 t, ssh t + 2 t, r = t +. With r = o we count T (x) = sin -1 (tn1 - t;)/2, t; ::::; t <t <t <t <t <ts, on the basis of trigonometric deposits, square formulas are built for calculating the singular integral Vides: I 1 12. ,,. x - t s (!, t) = - ctg -f (x) dx, 27r o 2 t e [o, 27r), (2) 238 The density of which J (x) is a 2p -periodic function from the class of the CA of the helder. Built approximate methods of calculating; 1 -siller integral (2) are used for a numerical solution of the Gular integral equation of the Hilbert b (t) 12 "x - t a (t) R.P (t) + - R.P (x) CTG -DT + 2TT 0 2 1 12 " +- k (t, x) r.p (x) dx = f (t), 2p 0 (3) the coefficients of which a, b, k (for both arguments), f are 2tt periodic gölder functions, and <p. - The desired function. The approximate solution of the equation (3) is searched in the form of a splan n r.p (t) = l ck1/! K (t), (4) k = o where FK (t) - a system of fundamental trigonometric slices of a fixed degree on a given mesh networks (1) . The prefracted unambiguous resolution of the equation (3), to find unknown CK from (4), is obtained by a system of linear and 1 geibraic equations. Analysis of this scheme is carried out from weighty methods [1, 2]. In particular, it is possible. 1 is optimal. Literature 1. Gabdulkhaev b. G. On the approxima 'Tigon.
