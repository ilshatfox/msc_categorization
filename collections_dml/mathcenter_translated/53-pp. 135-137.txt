Student science: STEM technologies in the theory of numbers in mathematics have a number of results where the use of extensive machine calculations is absolutely necessary. There are similar tasks available to schoolchildren and students, and in theo Rii of numbers [3]. An additional incentive is that the task may not have a universally recognized solution and its occupation is not just a training training, but a real scientific experiment at the advanced lines of knowledge. Exactly what is the spirit of STEM technologies-Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics [1]. Example 1. Study of the properties of the Euler function φ (n). The sum of the values ​​of the function of Euler 136 M.V. Rozhkova, A.V. Horns n∑ i = 1 φ (n) = 3n2 π2 +o (n lnn). We denote the arithmetic mean value of the Euler function through φ (n). In the GAP4P8R5 package, we conducted the following experiment. For all N <1010, the inequality is performed −0, 2 <φ (n) - 3n π2 <0, 8. Very rarely, but the approach turned out to be a lack, not an excess. All differences lie inside the interval of a single length, i.e. The evaluation of the difference as O (LNN) may not be true. Example 2. Construction of natural numbers obtained by the consistent application of the function F, which is natural a = a1a2 ... an in correspondence f (a) = ak1 + a k 2 + ... + a k n. We do not know whether this task was solved by someone earlier, but the result is new. A package of computers of the keys on the open code Sage 7.3 was used. Theorem. Let A = A1A2 ... an, f (A) = A K 1+A K 2+...+A K N. Then, the sequence is {a, f (a), f (f (a)), ...} can only end with the following cycles: k = 2: 2 cycles - {1}, {4, 16, 37, 58, 89 , 145, 42, 20}; k = 3: 9 cycles - 5 lengths 1, 2 lengths 2 and 3; k = 4: 6 cycles - 4 lengths 1 and 1 length 2 and 7; k = 5: 16 cycles - 7 lengths 1, 2 lengths 2 and 10, 1 length 4, 6, 24, 28, 44; K = 6: 7 cycles - 2 lengths 1, 1 length 2, 3, 4, 10, 25; k = 7: 17 cycles - 6 lengths 1, 2 lengths 2, 1 length 3, 6, 12, 14, 21, 27, 30, 56, 93.

In the case of plant material with a high initial content of extracted substances, the macroscopic equation of the filtration of the solvent can be recorded in a sistational approximation [1]. The second equation of the model describes the microscopic diffusion transfer extract at the level of a separate particle of crushed raw materials. The approach of a tapering nucleus is often used here. The workers also consider particles of a flat (plate) form,
