. Universal morphism of vector stratification of R. N. Alishev Kazan State University Let Vectn have many vector stratification of rank N over compact varieties. Vector stratification hole is called universal if, for any stratification ă ∈ Vectn, there is a smooth display f of its base B into the Bu universal stratification base, called the classification, such that ă = f ∗ ising. It is known that universal vector stratification exists and the Ring of the claw h ∗ BU of the universal stratification base contains all the characteristic classes of vector stratification from Vectn in the sense that any characteristic class of stratification ă vectn is F ∗ ω, ω ∈ H ∗ Bu, where f is F. classifying display [3], [4]. The purpose of this work is to build universal morphism of vector stratification. The need for such a construction arises when studying the characteristics of morphisms of vector stratification (see [1], [2]). Definition. A pair of vector stratification (E, E0) of the rank (M, K) above the variety M will call such a couple of stratification (E, E0) that E0 is an extension E, Ranke0 = k <m = ranke. 13 Let's say that the variety M has a type P if it allows the coating no more than P are in areas, homotopically equivalent points. We fix the P and designate through Vectm, k many pairs of vector stratification of the rank (m, k) above the varieties of the type P. Put GN, M, K = {(V0, V) | V0⊂V ⊂RN, DIM V0 = N --M, DIM V = N -K}. Offer. There is a universal pair of vector stratification (ξu, (hole) 0) with the base GN, M, K, where n depends on P, such that for any pair (ctor, ă) ∈ Vectm, k there is a smooth display f of its base b. In gn, m, k with the property ă = f ∗ ă, ă0 = f ∗ (ă) 0. Any morphism α: e → F of the vector stratification of the rank n above the variety M is unambiguously set by its graph Graphα, which is a vector decrease in the stratification of E ⊕ F, a transversal second direct terms. Theorem. For any natural n, there are n = n (p) and a pair of vector stratification (ξu, (hole) 0) with the base GN, N, n such that for any morphism α: e → F of vector wagons n above diversity m type P There is a smooth display f: m → gn, 2n, n, such that f ∗ ₽ = e ⊕ f and f ∗ (ă) 0 = graph α. Thus, a couple of vector stratification (lection, (hole) 0) is natural to consider as universal morphism of vector stratification of the same rank over the variety of the final type.
