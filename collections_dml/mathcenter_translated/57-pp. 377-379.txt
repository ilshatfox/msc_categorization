Khomiddin2 1 Faizullo100@yahoo.com; Bokhtar State University named after N. Khusrava, Tajikistan 2 Sayfullohomidin@gmail.com; Bokhtar State University named after N. Khusrava, Tajikistan in the work for one reduced system of differential equations of the second order obtained the presentation of the variety of solutions in explicitly, when the coefficients of the first equation are interconnected in a certain way. The properties of the decisions obtained were studied, and the task with the initial data A1 has been considered. Key words: a redundant system, a variety of solutions, a rectangle, a singular coefficient, the properties of solutions. Let D - rectangle: d = {(x, y): 0 <x <δ1, 0 <y <Δ2}. Next, we denote γ1 = {y = 0, 0 <x <δ1}, γ2 = {x = 0, 0 <y <Δ2}. In the area D, consider the system of the following type 2u ∂x∂y + a1 (x, y) rα ∂u ∂x + b1 (x, y) rβ ∂u ∂y + c1 (x, y) rα + β u = f1 (x, y) rα + β, ∂u ∂y + b2 (x, y) yγ u = f2 (x, y) yγ, (1) where α = β = γ = 1, a j (x, y), b1 (x, y), c1 (x, y), f j (x, y), j = 1.2 - specified functions in the area d, u ( x, y) - the desired function. Differential equations and redundant systems with regular, singular and super -sulfur coefficients were studied in work [1] [8]. In this note, based on a method developed in [2], the presentation of the variety of solutions of the system of equations (1) is obtained using one arbitrary constant. Through C2 (D), we subsequently denote a class of functions that have continuous derivatives of the first order in D and such that ux y ∈C (D). Theorem 1. Let in the system of equations (1) α = β = γ = 1, and the coefficients and right parts satisfy the following conditions: 1) b1 (x, y), f2 (x, y) ∈C 1Y (D), B2 (x, y) ∈C 1x (d), a1 (x, y), c1 (x, y), f1 (x, y) ∈C (d); 378 Materials of the School-Conference 2) C1 (X, Y) = R 2 ∂∂y (B1 (X, Y) R) +A1 (X, Y) B1 (X, Y); 3) | a1 (x, y) −A1 (0.0) | ≤ h1rα1, h1 = const, 0 <α1 <1, | b1 (x, y) −b1 (0.0) | ≤ h2rβ1, h2 = const, 0 <β1 <1, | b2 (0, y) −b2 (0.0) | ≤ h3yγ1, h3 = const, 0 <γ1 <1, 4) a1 (0.0)> 0, b1 (0.0) <0, b2 (0.0)> 0; 5) a) ∂ ∂y (b1 (x, y) r) = ∂ ∂x (b2 (x, y) y) in d, b) b1 (x, y) f2 (x, y) r y + ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ y (f2 (x, y) y) = (b2 (x, y) y - a1 (x, y) r) · exp [−W1a1 (x, y) + a1 (0.0) ln x y + r] × × (wor (x) + y∫ 0 f1 (x, s) x2 + s2 exp [w ​​1 a1 (x, s) (s + p x2 + s2 x) a1 (0.0) d S + f1 (x , y) r in D; 6) there are limits of lim y → 0 f2 (x, y) y = f 12 (y), limy → 0 b2 (x, y) y = b12 (y), f1 (x, y) ) = o ((y + r x) −A1 (0.0)) r γ1), γ1> 1 with R → 0. Then any solution to the system of equations (1) from class C2 (D) is represented in the form of U (x, y) ≡χ1 (ψ1 (y), ∗1 (x), f1 (x, y)), (2) ψ1 (y) ≡ n1 (c1, f2 (0, y)), (3) ng (x) ≡ f1 (x), (4) where χ1 (ψ1 (y), ng (x), f1 (x, y)), n1 (c1, f2 (0, y)) - well -known integral operators, f1 (x) - The well -known function, C1 is an arbitrary constant. Investigation 1. If x → 0 and y → 0, then lim y → 0 {lim x → 0 u (x, y)} = o (y --b2 (0.0)), lim x → 0 {yb2 (0 0) lim y → 0 u (x, y)} = c1, u (x, y) = o ((y x + r) b1 (0.0) with y → 0 and x ̸ = 0. Based on the resulting obtained The integrated representation of the solutions is set and solved the following problem with the initial data. Problem A1. It is required to find a solution to the system of equations (1) from class C2 (D) by the condition of LIM X → 0 {YB2 (0.0) Lim Y → 0 U (X, 0 U (X, y)} = m1, where M1 is a given permanent. F.M. Shamsudinov, S. Khomiddin 379 Solution Task A1. To solve this problem, we use the integral representation (2), (3) and (4), the properties of solutions and the condition of the problem A1.
