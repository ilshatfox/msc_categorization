Materials of the youth school-conference finding dense N-K in the process of calculations used ideas and methodology set forth in the work [1], [2]. Calculations were made using a package of computer algebra GAP 4.8.8. The official address http://www.gap-system.org/ Knowing the structure of n-ki a difficult task is the direct finding of the “living n-ki” of this structure. This task is easy to parallelize the natural row is divided into segments and on each of them the N-ka of this structure is searched. Using about 20 computers in 2013, we managed to find the first 14-ku, it turned out to be 17 just. The smallest 15 has 19 signs, 16-ka-21 sign, 17-ka 23 signs, 18-ka 25 signs, 19-ka 27 characters, 20-ka 29 characters, the first 20ka was found only in 2015 and the most and the most The small 21 also has 29 signs. Currently, 21-k found only 3 pieces. At the same time, no one has yet been found! You can get acquainted with the latest achievements in this area at https://sites.google.com/site/anthonydforbes/ktuplets.htm?attredirects=0 Here is the main program for calculating “live” n-ki. There are two auxiliary subprograms: REM-it comes to all-fraud, p-the beginning of the structure of the structure M and the applicants are selected according to the module-the works of all the first m of simple numbers. ALL-checks that all N-ki elements with structure M consists of simple numbers. The main program T (S, M, M, N) uses these programs on different intervals of the natural series, namely on the interval (M, N). REM: = Function (M, M) Local I, J, K, L, D, D, K, L, S; L: = 1; L: = []; K: = [1]; D: = []; S: = []; for i in [1..m] do l: = l*primes [i]; L: = m of primes [i+1]; L: = set (l); L: = difference ([0..primes [i+1] -1], l); for j in l do for k in k do d: = chineserem ([l, primes [i+1]], [k, primes [i+1] -j]); Add (D, D); OD; OD; K: = Set (D); D: = []; OD; S [1]: = k; S [2]: = Length (K); S [3]: = l*primes [m+1]; Return (S); end; S: = rem (m, m) ;; A.

Almost any cryptographic algorithm begins with the words: “Let p is a random simple number.” The number should be random and very preferably located in a “general position”. But if a simple number turned out to be belonging, for example, a dense 10-ke, then its position will not be general. In fact, we consider a typical “cryptographic number” containing 300 decimal signs. According to the law of the distribution of prime numbers in the region of 300 significant numbers, the simple numbers will be about every 700th. At the same time, every 4th number will be simple in a dense 10-ke! Therefore, if we accidentally chose a simple number from a dense N-ki, then its cryptographic value becomes doubtful. Appendix from the field of abstract mathematics. The Hard-Litlwood hypothesis is well known that with the removal of the local coordinate (and not only the global, according to the law of P.L. Chebyshev) the density of the distribution of simple numbers decreases. Nevertheless, in a dense 447-q density of simple numbers is higher than at the beginning of the coordinates (see http://www.opertech.com/primes/ktuples.html). The problem is that if a dense 447 exists, then the minimum element in it may have at least 900 signs in decimal recording, so finding it before the invention of quantum computers is very doubtful. 34 Materials of the Youth School-Conference Conclusions, without even supercomputers, it makes sense to explore dense N-ki, and, moreover, it is necessary. The mentioned calculators are engaged in records, look for more and more sickly digitables, uninteresting in the device for the condenses of simple numbers NN! . It was shown that even within 10 12 dense 6-k about 20 times more than the global law of distribution of simple numbers predicts. Dense 7-k 100 times more, dense 8-k 1000 times, dense 9-k 4000 times more, dense 10-k in 5 thousand times, etc. It should be noted that the proportions of the number of real N-K to the distribution predicted by the global law are preserved in all intervals that we managed to check from 106 to 1015, this gives rise to hope that such an attitude is the law, and not the effect of the beginning of coordinates. Distribution of dense N-K-certain cities for simple numbers can be the key to understanding the laws of local distribution of prime numbers, which is very important for the theory of numbers and for cryptography.
