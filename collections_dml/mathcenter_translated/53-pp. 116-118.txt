Characterization of the central elements of the algebra of operators inequalities, let A-with*-albubra. Through A+, the cone of positive elements of algebra A is indicated. Through a ∗, a ∗ h, a ∗+ the space of continuous functionals on algebra A, its material subspace of the Hermite functionals and the positive part of the space of continuous function of fishing are designated. Theorem. For a ∈ A+ the following statements are equivalent: (i) A lies in the center C (A) algebra A; (ii) f+ (a) 6 f1 (a) for each F ∈ A ∗ H and any decomposition F = F1 - F2, where F1, F2 ∈ A ∗+; (III) Display F 7 → F+(A) (F ∈ A ∗ H) monotonously, t.

Novikov Kazan (Volga) Federal University, novartole@yandex.ru Variation of the capacity of a three -dimensional capacitor during a smooth change in its border, let D - the area concluded between closed, the smoothness of Kimi, the dipho -nomorphic sphere with surfaces σ0 and σ1 that σ1 covers Σ0. Let the function u: d → [0, 1] belongs to the class C (D) ∪ c2 (D) and is a solution to the next task of the conductor    u (x) = 0, x ∈ D, u (x) = 0, x ∈ σ0, u (x) = 1, x ∈ σ1. Definition. The value of cap (d) = ∫ d ∇u (x) ‖2 dx is called the conformal capacity of the capacitor with the field d. Variations of capacitors' capacities with a smooth change in its boundary plates were considered earlier, for example, in [1] for the case of flat areas and in [2] for capacitors in RN, the field of which is limited by concentric spheres. We continue these studies.
