. Study of the stability of soil slopes based on the method of finite elements Yu. G. Konoplev, S. A. Malkin, L. W. Sultanov, N. V. Shaikhutdinov Kazan State University, Kazan Introduction at the current level of development of computer technology increasingly increases the degree using the method of final elements in construction and other areas of production. The methods of calculating the stability of slopes and embankments based on the method of finite elements are also developing. The advantage of the method of finite elements in analyzing the stability of slopes and embankments over traditional methods is that there is no need for preliminary assumptions about the shape and position of the surface (line) of sliding. The method used can be applied to the slopes and embankments of arbitrary shape and soil deposits in both two -dimensional and three -dimensional directions. The equilibrium stress-deformed state is calculated with great accuracy. The sliding surface is determined in general form and can be not only piece-round-round-cylindrical. 1 Cinematics of the environment we introduce into the consideration ~ r (ă j) = x i (ă j) ~ ei-radius vector of the material particle in the non-formed state, ~ r (ă j) = = yi (ă j) ~ ei-radius vector of material Particles in a deformed state, ~ u (μj) = ~ r (₽) - ~ r (ă) = ui (hole) ~ ei - vector 179 Study of the stability of soil slopes. . . moving the body point from the state that is not formed into deformiro, ~ υ (ξj) = ~ ̇r (perf) = ẏi (hole) ~ ei = υ I (hole) ~ ei is a speed vector, where ~ ei is the orths of the Global Desart Coordinate System, Regarding which the process of deformation is investigated, the hole J - the material coordinates of the body point, which in the end -elemental implementation are local coordinates. We will determine the kinematics of deformation of the body with the help of the spatial gradient gradient (h) = ∂υi ∂yj ~ ei ⊗ ~ ej = hij ~ ei ⊗ ~ ej, which can be divided by the amount of speed tensor = 1 2 [(h) + (h) t] = dij ~ ei ⊗ ~ ej and tensor of rotation speeds (ω) = 1 2 [(h) - (h) t] = ωij ~ ei ⊗ ~ ej. 2 The determining ratio of the tense state is described by the tensor of the true stresses of the cat - Euler (σ) = σijei ⊗ ej, the components of which characterize the stresses that occur on the faces of the elementary volume in the deformed state. Considering the isotropic environment, for convenience we decompose the tensor of speed deformation and tensor tensor into the ball parts D0 = 1 3 DII, σ0 = 1 3 σII and the deviators d′ ij = dij - δijd0, σ′ij = σij - δijσ0, where δij is the symbol of the crownx . 180 Yu. G. Konoplev, S. A. Malkin, L. W. Sultanov, N.V. Shaikhutdinov to solve problems taking into account plastic deformation, the formulation of resolving variations in the speeds of deformations and stresses became widespread. We write the physical ratios of elastic deformation in the form of a linear dependence between the speed of the tensor of the Koshi - Euler and the tensor of speed deformations: (σ̇0) = 3k (d0), (σ̇ ′) = 2G (d ′), where g = e/(1 (1 + µ)), k = e/(3 (1 - 2µ)), e is the elastic module, µ is the Poisson coefficient. Component these ratios have the form σ̇0 = 3kd0, σ̇ ′ IJ = 2GD ′ IJ. 3 The calculation algorithm of the initial is the equation of virtual capacities in the actual configuration ∫∫∫ ω (σ) · · (δd) dω = ∫∫∫ ω · · δ ~ υdω + ∫∫ sσ ~ p · δ ~ υds, (3.1) where Ω is the current volume, s’s is the part of its surface, on which efforts are set, ~ q, ~ p are vectors of mass and surface forces. After linarization (3.1), we obtain the resolving equation in the stress speeds ∫∫∫ ω [(σ̇) · · (δd)] dω = ∫∫∫ ω ̇ · δ ~ υdω + ∫∫ s’s ̇P · δ ~ υDS. The soil array seems to be a continuous environment with specific physical and mechanical properties. Structurally, three groups of soils can be distinguished, the modeling of which should be distinguished: the first is sand, the second is clay and the third - rocky rocks. The main difference between them in the strength of the connections between individual crystals and the grains of the environment. 181 Study of stability of soil slopes. . . When describing the properties of the soil, the Mizes -Botkin model is used. Such a model requires six properties of soil: the angle of internal friction φ, adhesion C, the angle of dilatation ψ, the elasticity module E, Poisson's coefficient ν and density ρ. The elasticity module and Poisson coefficient have the main effect on the determination of deformations before the destruction of the ground array. But their influence on the determination of the stability coefficient of the slope or embankment is few. In this work, their values ​​are accepted by constant, and for clay they are equal to E = 24 MPa, ν = 0.42. The angle of dilatation ψ affects the change in volume during the movement of the soil. If ψ = φ, the law of the plastic course is called associated if ψ 6 = φ is unassocrated. In this work, the change in volume during destruction will not be taken into account, and the angle of dilatation ψ = 0. Thus, when studying the stability of embankments, we will consider only three parameters of the soil model: the angle of inner
