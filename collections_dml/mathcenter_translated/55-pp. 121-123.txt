UDC 514.76 On the object of curvature of fundamental-group coherence of the 2nd Order of N.A. Ryazanov1 1 ryazanov-92@mail.ru; Baltic Federal University. I. Kant, the Institute of Physical Committee of the Physical Committee and Information Technologies The object of curvature of the 2nd Order contains the object of curvature of fundamental group coherence specified in the main stratification; an object of curvature of affinated connectedness over diversity; Components of the 2nd order. Differential comparisons are displayed on the components of the object of curvature of fundamental-group coherence of the 2nd order. These comparisons show that the object of curvature of the 2nd Order forms a geometric object only in the aggregate with components of the 2nd order of an object of connectedness. In the general case, the object of curvature of fundamental group coherence of the 2nd order does not form a tensor. Keywords: Laptev’s structural equations, fundamental-group connectivity, object of curvature of the 2nd order. 122 Materials of the Youth School-Conference Consider the main stratification of GR (MN), the base of which is the N-dimensional smooth variety of MN, and the typical layer is the R-Member Group of Lee GR. The fundamental group of the 2nd order is set in the continued main stratification with structural equations dωi = ω j ∧ωij, dωα = cαβγω β∧ωmba +∧ωαi, dωij = ωkjj ∧ωik +ω k ∧ωij k, dωαi = ω j i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i I ∧ωαj +ω β i ∧ωα β +ω j ∧ωαi J (ωαβ = c α β ωmb, i, ... = 1, α, ... = n +1, n +r) using the field object γ2 = {γα i, γi j k, lα i j}, the components of which are satisfied with differential equations ∆γαi +ωαi = γαI J, ∆IJ k +ω i j k = γ i j klω L, ∆LαI J γ γ j β β β i +Γki jularαk +α i j = lαi j kω k.

The object of curvature of the 2nd Order R2 = {Rα I J, R I J Kl, Kα I J K} contains: a) the object of curvature rα I j fundamentally group coherence set in the main niigr (mN), b) curvature R IJ KL affinated connectedness Above the variety of mn, c) components of the 2nd order Kα I j k. The object of curvature R2 forms a geometric object only in the aggregate with components of the 2nd Order of Lα I J object of the connectedness of the 2nd order γ2. In the general case, the object of curvature R2 fundamentally-group coherence of the 2nd order does not form a tensor (see [1, 2]). Literature 1. Ryazanovn.A.
