. Clarifications of the inequality of Fire - Jackson A. A. Putintsev Bashkir State University, mail.bashedu.ru in 1910. Fayer put forward a hypothesis of the justice of negligence n∑ k = 1 sinkx k> 0, 0 <x <π; n = 1, 2 ,. . . . In 1911, Jackson proved the validity of this inequal, therefore it is called the inequality of Fire -Jackson. Since then, the generalizations of this inequality were devoted to many 181st works (see review in [1, 2]). For example, the above negligence was improved by a 4 Sin2 x 2 touran (CTG X 2 --π - x 2) <n∑ k = 1 sin kx k, 0 <x <π; n = 2, 3,. . . . In [2], this assessment was strengthened: for all N> 2 and X ∈ (0, π) the inequality X2 (CTG X 2 - π - x 2) <n∑ k = 1 sin kx k. To determine the best approximation of the functions of trigon metric polynomas, we needed to clarify the negligence of the fire -json at the ends of the interval (0, π). Theorem 1. For any natural n, the inequality is n∑ k = 1 sin kx k> sinnx at 0 <x <π/(2n). Theorem 2. For any natural n, the inequality is N∑ k = 1 sinkx k> n (n+1) sin2 x 2 (ctg x 2 - π - x 2), π - π 2n <x <π. Note 1. Outside of the 1, 2 intervals given in theorems, the sum of the row varies near the straight line y = (π - x)/2. Note 2. To determine the coefficients of the inequality and behavior of the series, the Matlab 7.2 package was used, set up on the cluster of the center of computer technology of the Matical Department of the Bashgu. The work was carried out with the support of the RFFI, project 06-01-00354. 182 L and T R A T R A 1. Polya G., Sege G. tasks and theorems from analysis. T. 2. - M.: Gostechizdat, 1956. 2.

Reshetnikov Nizhny Novgorod University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, Genserg@hotmail.com The second group of claws of classic algebrons Lee with the EPRICTIONS in the attached module in the characteristic P = 2 was found for algebrus with a homogeneous system of Cor Chebochko [2]. The calculation of the second group of whom the monitoring for the rest of the classic algebrus Lee is a great difficulty. A software complex was developed for calculating the HN (l; m) of an arbitrary final algebra Lee L with the coefficients in the final module M for the case of the specified structural constants L and M. In addition, the graduated algebra L and the graduated module of the module M provides for the possibility of simplifying the calculations Due to the graduation on claws. The results of a numerical experiment for claws of the class of the Syatic algebris of the CN series, N 6 8 showed that the dimension of the Crumology group H2 (L) is 2N2 +5N - 1, where n is the rank of algebra L, and the basic cockers deliver the following weights (in designations [1]): 1. For µ = 0, we have dimh2µ (l; l) = n - 1; 183
