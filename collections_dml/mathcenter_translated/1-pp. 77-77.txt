The graphic representation of the forms of own oscillations of the round plate Agapova Yu.V. NO: Nsegorod State University made a review of literature for 1958-1995 on its own Killes of round plates. In this literature, the calculation is carried out according to the classical theory of Kirchhof. For a round plate, rigidly fixed along the contour, expression for forms of own oscillations are compiled by analytically. To determine the deflection, a program on Fortran for IVM RS is written. The results of the calculations are displayed in the form of a table. Graphic image of the forms is carried out using the POV-RA y package, which is in one of the departments of the Research Institute of NSU mechanics at the stage of study and the initial example for specific tasks. This package was developed by a large team of authors. Some information about POV-RA can be found on the Internet. In Fig. 1, 2, 3 shows the forms of own oscillations of the circle of loi, a rigidly fixed plate, depending on the number of nodal diameters of the PI circles t.
