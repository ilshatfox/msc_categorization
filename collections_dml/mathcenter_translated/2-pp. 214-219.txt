“Zone” pre -conditioner 2 1. Consider the task of the conductor for the equation of an elliptical type {∂ ∂x (k (x) ∂u ∂x) = ∂x), 0 <x <1, u (0) = u (1) = 0 (1) with a piece-to-stand function K (x): K (x) = {k1, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2, k2, 1/2 <x ≤ 1, k1, k2> 0. (2) The Galerkin method allows you to reduce this task to the system of linear algebraic equations, the solution of which is obtained by iteration methods. To reduce the number of iterations in this case, you can apply a “zone” pre -tetrirator. Its description is contained in section 2. Proof of the absence of spectral equivalence of the reduced task is devoted to the final paragraph. The author thanks Professor Tyrtyshnikov E. E. For setting the problem and consultation when solving it. 2. First, we briefly describe the process of transition from the task (1)-(2) to the system of linear algebraic equations. On the segment [0, 1] we set the uniform grid τ = {IH | I = 0, 1, ..., n+ 1} with a step h = 1/(n+ 1). Without limiting the community, we believe that n = 2l. We define a set of n of the Nine-linear functions φi, each of which is different from zero only in the corresponding node I. We will look for a solution in the form of u (x) = n∑ i = 1 xiφi (x). (3) Multiplying (1) Puit on φi, i = 1, ..., n, and dedicating on the segment [0, 1], we have 1∫ 0 k (x) ∂u (x) ∂x ∂φi (x ) ∂x dx = - 1∫ 0 f (x) φi (x) dx, i = 1, ..., n, (4) 1in institute of computational mathematics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, st.

(5) As a result, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations AX = F, (6) where f = (F1, ..., fn), fi = - 1∫ 0 f (x) φi (x) dx, i = 1, ..., n, a - matrix with elements aij = 1∫ 0 k (x) ∂φj (x) ∂x ∂φi (x) ∂x dx. Simple calculations show that a is a three -dyagonal matrix, a = a0/h, where A0 has the form:  2K1 −K1 | —K1 2K1 —K1 | –K1. . . . . . | . . . 2K1 –K1 | —K1 (K1 + K2) | - K2 - - - - - + - - - - - - - - k1 | 2k2 –K2 | —K2 2K2 —K2 | –K2. . . . . . | . . . 2k2 –K2 | —K2 2K2  . To solve the system (6), we introduce fictitious components y = (y1, y2) and we will consider the system of order n+ 2 âu = f̂, (7) where â = [a b12 0 b22], u = [x y], f̂ = [f 0] (8) 215 (the reader will be able to find the details of the method of fictitious components in [1]). In fact, Y1 reflects the influence of the L -hh node on (l + 1), if k (x) ≡ k1, and y2 -influence (L + 1) -ht on l -n -s for k (x) ≡ k2.

Thus, we solve the system ãb̃ -1z = f̂, (9) resulting from (7) replacement U = b̂ -1z, ã = hâ, b̃ = hb̂. If the matrix of equation (9) is represented in the form of ãb̃−1 = (ã - b̃) b̃- - 1 + i, where I is a single matrix of the corresponding order, then the assertion that the solution of this reduced system can be obtained, it can be obtained no more, than for two iterations. 3. In this section, we show the absence of spectral equivalence of the system (9), i.e. We establish the fact of the desire for zero when grinding the mesh of the minimum own value of the sulfed task ã = λb̃x. Imagine x in the form of x = (x1, x2), x1-n-dimensional vector, then taking into account the ratios ã = [ã11 b̃12 0 b̃22], b̃ = [b̃11 b̃12 b̃21 b̃22], ã11 = ha, b̃ij = hbij, i , j = 1, 2, we have {ã11x1 + b̃12x2 = λb̃11x1 + λb̃12x2, b̃22x2 = λb̃21x1 + λb̃22x2. From the second equation, we express x2 and substitute the first (we consider only λ <1):    x2 = λ 1 - λb̃ −1 22 b̃21x1, (ã11 - λ (b̃11 - b̃12b̃−122 b̃12)) x2 = 0. Thus. , it is enough to investigate the spectral equivalence of ã11 and b = b̃11 - b̃12b −122 b̃21, while the B is the diagonal matrix with the three -dyagonal blocks b =   2k1 — K1 | —K1 2K1 —K1 | –K1. . . . . . | . . . 2K1 –K1 | —K1 3 2 k1 | - - - - - - + - - - - - - | 3 2 k2 —K2 | —K2 2K2 —K2 | –K2. . . . . . | . . . 2k2 –K2 | −K2 2K2   217 We introduce two billine forms α (x) = (ã11x, x) and β (x) = (bx, x). Obviously, α (x) ≥ min (k1, k2) α0 (x), β (x) ≤ max (k1, k2) β0 (x), where α0 (x) = (a0x, x), β0 (x) = (B0x, X), and A0 and B0 are obtained from ã11 and B, respectively, replacing K1 and K2 per unit. Since K1 and K2 are arbitrary, we come to the task of study A0 and B0. Suppose that the matrices A0 and B0 are spectrally equivalent (in fact, we have two sequences of matrices (A0) N and (B0) N U
