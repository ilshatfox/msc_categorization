Using energy integrals, the unity of the problem V, and then (by integral equations), the existence of this solution is proved. D. D. V. Buslyuk (Grodno) Integles of differential systems in private derivatives considered the system of equations in private derivatives LJY = O, J = 1, (1) built on the basis of not rolomorphic linearly related to the area of ​​the complex space of CN LIENLY Differential operators of the first order lj (x) = u3i (x) di (i = l, n), in which the coordinates uij: g-+ s, j = 1, m, i = 1, n, the essence of the holomorphic functions in the area G. In [1], the existence of autonomous private and front integrals, as well as the latest factors in non -autonomous systems of cheers, was investigated imperatives in complete differentials. On the basis of the approach, developed in [1], for the linear uniform differential system of storage (1), the necessary conditions and criteria for the existence of the first and private integrals have been obtained, which depend not on all variables, but only on R variables (the so-called R- The cylindrical first and private integral fishing). The task of the independence for 56 was also solved by fucius
