One factorized equation in the N-Mephom space considers the equation LU = D ° 'U + L A0 (X1, X2,., XN) DCRU, O <o: (1) where multicindles have n component, a = (1, 1, ..., 1), from wearing subordination A <A means that it is obtained from B with a decrease in at least one component. The solution of equation (1) will be called regular if all the continuing function of the desired function of the desired function. Through ~ we denote a single multicondex ( /'1, ..., l'n),' yi = 1, /'j = o, i: /- j, c <k1 ,,,, KN) there is a class of functions, having continuous derivatives AS1 +. .. +SN /8x ~ 1 • • • • ah ~ "for all values ​​sr ~ kr, r = 1, p.
