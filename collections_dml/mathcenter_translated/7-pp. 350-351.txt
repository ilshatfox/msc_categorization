. A way of optimal changes in the boundary conditions in the task of building an underground circuit A on a given distribution of the filtering rate of E.A. Shirokov Kazan State University 420008, Kazan, UA. Kremayevskaya, 18 Elena. Shirokova@ksi.ru in [1] provides a setting and solution of the problem of constructing an underground circuit of a hydraulic structure with an endless depth of a water -permeable layer at a filtration rate set along the desired contour as a function of parameter S. With a 350 function v = f (s), $ s $ l, fol f (s) ds = kh, the task is to be solved only if 1 11 'ds ln -d cos "fd" f = o, -11' ' Where the dependence s = g (1) is from the ratio! C to KH f (s) ds = -. ln'y + kh. about 7gt we find such a function '{l' w (s), $ s $ l, w (s) o, jo w (s) ds = l to v = /w (s) w '( s) the task has become resolved, with the condition that W (s) is as close as possible to S in a sense. It is proved that if W (s) = P -1 (S), where RT 1T RT P (T) = A FO Exp [Acos (KH FO F (S) DS)] DT, 2 RL 1T 7G RT A = - - KH [; 0 ln (khf (t)) owl (kn fo f (s) ds), a = l / fol exp [acos (k ~ fot f (s) ds) dt, then ll lnp ' (G (1)) ll ~ [o, 2, .. 1 $ jz; Ial.
