UDC 532.5 Separation of areas of stability / instability / neutral stability and calculating the solution parameters in a linear one -dimensional task of a hydraulic jump E.V. Semenko1, T.I. Semenko2 1 Semenko54@gmail.com; Novosibirsk State Technical University 2 Semenko54@gmail.com; The Novosibirsk State Technical University in a one -dimensional linear task of a hydraulic leap conducted numerical calculations on the separation of areas of stability and instability and the calculation of their common border (neutral stability) and the solution parameters in the event of neutral stability are numerically determined. Key words: hydraulic leap, shift model of fine water, stability, instability, neutral stability. Within the framework of the so -called shear model of small water (see, e.g., [1]), a one -dimensional task of a hydraulic leap is considered. The shift model of fine water is used in the option proposed and studied in [2–4]. It is a system of differential equations ∂h ∂t + ∂ (hu) ∂x = 0, ∂ (hu) ∂t + ∂x (hu2 + g h 2 2 + (onic + φ) h3) = g hβ --c f f u2, ∂ ∂t (h u2 + g h + (onic + φ) h2 2) + ∂ ∂x (hu (u2 2 + g h + 3 (onic) h 2 2)) = gβhu - (C f + Cr φ onic+φ) u3, (1) where the variable x ∈ [−L1, l2] is the point in the channel, the values ​​x = −l1 and x = l2 are the entrance and exit from the channel, respectively, t> 0 - time. The desired functions: h (x, t) - the height of the water level, u (x, t) - the horizontal speed and φ (x, t) - the so -called enstrophy. Parameters of the model (constants): G - acceleration of free fall, β - tangent of the angle of the bottom of the canal (the angle of inclination is considered constant); C F> 0 is called the coefficient of friction, and CR> 0 is the so -called resistance entered in [3] the so -called DRAG COEFFICIENT); ng> 0 is the so -called entry enstrophy (Wall Enstrophy). Here is the General Enstrophy E.V. Semenko, T.I. Semenko 305 ∗+φ (x, t) is a square of deviations of horizontal velocity from the average value as a vertical vertical and is considered as a characteristic of the diminishness of the flow. At the same time, the entry enstrophy pul characterizes small swirls associated with the friction of the water on the bottom of the canal, it is interpreted as a specified constant, and the enstrophy φ (x, t) (or rotational enstrophy, roller Enstrophy) is a variable the desired value associated with the rotation of water. At the entrance to the channel x = −l1, all three of the desired values ​​corresponding to the constant solution of the system (1): h = h1, u = u1 = √ νg h1, where ν = β/s f and φ = 0. (2) on Put the generally accepted output from the channel x = l2 (see for example [3.4]) the boundary condition of the drain UH ​​=   0, h <d, 2 3 cd √ 2g (h - d) 3, h> d, cd = π π +2 +0.08 h −d d, (3) where D is the height of the output dam. A hydraulic leap is considered as a breakdown solution of the system (1). If you indicate through x = f (t) the desired line of the gap, then we get standard conjugation conditions (analogue of the conditions of the Renkina-Gyugonio, see [3–5]) [hu] = f ′ (t) [h], [hu2 + g h 2 2 + (onic + φ) h3] = f ′ (t) [hu], [hu (u2 2 + g h + 3 (onic + φ) h 2 2)] = f ′ (t) [h u2 + g h + (∗ + φ) h2 2], (4) where, as usual, square brackets mean a jump in the function on the break. The curve x = f (t) is called the front of the shock wave. The stream mode is set by constants (hereinafter - the control parameters) β (or ν = β/c f), C F, CR, H1 (or input flow Q1 = U1H1), L2 and D. Note that the number of control parameters includes the number of Frud F R = U1/ √ G H1 = P ν. In the works [3, 4], the task (1), (2), (3), (4) (hereinafter referred to as the task of the hydraulic leap) was solved in numerically with various sets of control parameters. It turned out that the system in question model as a stable hydraulic leap, when the front strives for time for Constant F (t) → X0 = Const, T → °, and the solution strives to solve the stationary problem, and the front -observable fluctuations of the front when the front asymmptotically surpasses the front f (t) → x0 + ∑ k re (ak e iωk t), and the solution also asymptotically oscillises in time and space. In the work [5], the task of a hydraulic leap was studied analytically common for the theory of shock waves in the way: the task is linarized by a piece of constant solution, and the linearized task is analytically solved by transforming Fourier. As a result, it turned out that, depending on the set of managing parameters, the solution of a linearized problem can strive for 306 materials of the school-conference for a stationary and, accordingly, the front strives for Constant (according to the terminology of the theory of stresses), it can expertly strive for infinity ( case of instability), and, finally, asymptot
