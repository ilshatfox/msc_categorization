) Several results about E-prisoners and P-production of computable numbers, let µ and ν-two computable numbers of the set S. They say that µ e-prison (p-prison) to ν, if there is such a recursive number W (the navigable function F) that (∀s) (µ - 1 (s) = {x: (∃y) (〈x, y〉 ∈ W ∧ y ∈ ν - 1 (s)}), respectively (∀S) (µ - 1 (s) = {x: (∃y) (y ∈ Df (x) ∧dy ⊆ ν - 1 (s)}), where 〈x, y〉 is the cantor number of pairs (x, y) natural numbers from n, And DN is a canonical number of the final subset n. The existence of computable families of the final sets and the overall functions that do not have e-main numbering is proved. In [1] it is noted that there is a computable numbering of the family {{0, 1}, {0, 1, {0, 1, 2}, {3}, {0, 3}}, to which the P-Vydima is notable. It is further proved that: (1) If some numbering p-prison to the calculated numbering of the three-element family of recursive and enrolling sets, then it is computable; 60 (2) there is a computable numbering of the family {{0}, {1} , {0, 1}}, to which E-Vydima is inexpensive.

Puzarenko (Novosibirsk, vagrig@math.nsc.ru) about the properties of permissible sets by the author studies the ratios between the ratio of the properties of the descriptive theory of sets on permissible sets. For this, methods of both the classical theory of computing and the theory of sets and the theory of models are used. First, we recall some basic definitions. Model a signature σ, σ ⊇ {∈} is called a permissible set if A is the model KPU and 〈| A |, ∈〉 Fundamally. We limit ourselves to the consideration of the permissible sets of only the final signature. An important example of the permissible set is the hereditary final superstructure. Let M - the signature model τ with the main set m. Then • HF0 (m) = m; • hfn+1 (m) = hfn (m) ∪ pω (hfn (m)), where n <ω, pω (x) is many final subsidence of the set X; • HF (m) = ⋃n∈ Pi (m). In this case, HF (M) is a hereditary superstructure over the model M, considered as a signature model τ ∪ {u, ∈}, where UHF (m) = = m. On permissible sets, A-B can be set. n.
