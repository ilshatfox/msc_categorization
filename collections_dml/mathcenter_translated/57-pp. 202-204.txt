The materials of the school-conference here are worth noting that the proposed parametric method is a sufficient, but not necessary sign of the existence of a solution, and even in such a simple case as a scalar square equation, additional variation of the auxiliary operator A = –AI is necessary to cover all cases of the existence of a solution. The simplest choice of the operator A = 0 as in the work [1] is insufficient to prove the existence of a solution in case of positive discriminant, therefore the proposed method gives an improvement even in this simplest case, and thereby allows a sufficient sign to be made necessary and sufficient. In the general case, however, it should be borne in mind that obtaining the necessary and sufficient features proposed by the parametric method, if possible, it requires preliminary knowledge of such a criterion with the further selection of auxiliary operators A, covering all known cases of the criterion. With a specific choice of operator A, the parametric method only delivers a sufficient feature. Literature 1. Hartman F. ordinary differential equations. - M.: Mir, 1970. - 720 c. 2. Lobanov S. G.

The criterion for the completeness of such a system has been obtained. Keywords: a system of exposed monomas, completeness, convex region. Let λ = {λk, nk} φk = 1 - a multiple sequence of positive numbers, O.A. Krivosheeva, A.F. Kuzhaev 203 λk <λk+1, k ≥ 1, λk →+urb, nk purpose. Put n (t, λ) = ∑ λk <t nk. The upper density of the sequence λ is called respectively N (λ) = lim t →+φ n (t, λ) t, and the maximum density of the sequence λ is called N0 (λ) = Lim Δ →+0 N0 (λ, δ), N0 (Λ, δ) = lim t →+و (t, λ) −n (t (1–δ), λ) tδ, Δ ∈ (0.1). Consider the system of exponential monomas E (λ) = {zneλk z} nk - 1, urb n = 0, k = 1. Our task is to investigate the problem of the completeness of the E (λ) system in the field of D ⊂C, i.e. In the space of analytical functions in the field of D with the topology of uniform convergence on the compact subset of the region D. Most often, the problem of completeness in the convex region is most often studied. From the result of I.F. Krasichkov-Ternovsky ([1], theorem 8.3) it follows that, subject to N (λ) < +φ, the system E (λ) is not full in any unlimited convex area that contains a vertical half-prince. Convex areas that do not have this property lie in a certain horizontal strip. The criterion for the completeness of the E (λ) system in the horizontal strip was obtained by P. Maljaven and L. Rubel [2] (it is formulated in terms of the logarithmic density of the sequence). B. N. Khabibullin [3] summarized this result in case of unlimited areas lying in a horizontal strip. There are a number of results about the completeness of the E (λ) system in the circle (see, for example, [4], chap. IV, [5], chap. I, §7). In the case of arbitrary limited areas B.Ya. Levin ([4], chap. IV, theorem 21) and A.F. Leontyev [6] independently obtained the following classic result. We will formulate it for convex areas. Let D is a convex area. The vertical diameter of the region D is called the size D (D) = SUP X Sup Y1, Y2 {| Y1 - Y2 | : x + i y1, x + i y2 ∈ D}. Theorem 1. Let theλ = {λk, nk}. If theratic sequence with a density n (λ) = τ> 0, then the E (λ) system is full in any convex area with a vertical diameter D (D) ≤ 2πτ and is not full in any convex area with a vertical diameter D (D)> 2πτ. The problem of the completeness of the E (λ) system in limited convex areas was also studied in work [7] and [8]. In [8], a generalization of theorem 1 for some sequences that do not have density was obtained in one of the classes of convex areas (in particular, in the class of areas that have vertical or horizontal axes of symmetry). 204 Materials of the School-Conference The purpose of this work is the distribution of the result of the theorem 1 to one of the classes of sequences that do not have density. Theorem 2. Let λ = {λk, nk}, n̄0 (λ) = τ <mm. The following statements are equivalent: 1) the E (λ) system is incomplete in any convex area D with a vertical diameter D (D)> 2πτ, and is full in any convex region D with a vertical diameter D (D) ≤ 2πτ; 2) n̄ (λ) = τ.
