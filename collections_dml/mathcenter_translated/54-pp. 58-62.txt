UDC 517.51 ​​Approxulation of some classes of functions of many variables with hyperbolic sums of Fourier according to a multiple system of bursts with compact carriers of Sh.A. Balgimbaev1 1 Sholpan.Balgyn@gmail.com; The Institute of Mathematics and Mathematical Modeling, Almaty, Kazakhstan obtained accurate in order to assess the approximation by hyperbolic sums of Fourier according to a multiple system of bursts with compact media on classes like Nikolsky -Besov and Lizorkin - LQ space for all kinds of classes of classes and space. Keywords: Fourier crosses, hyperbolic cross, spaces such as Nikolsky -Besov, spaces such as Lizorkin -Thibel. Let N, R, Z - many natural, real and integers, respectively; N0 = n∪ {0}, r+ = (0,+ urb). Let lq = lq ([0.1] d) (1 ≤ q ≤و, 2 ≤ d ∈ N) - the space of measurable functions f: [0.1] d → c, summarized to degree q (with q = φ essentially limited) on [0.1] D with the standard norm ∥ f | Lq ∥ = ∥ f | Lq ([0.1] d) ∥ = (ˆ [0.1] d | f (x) | q d x) 1/q (1 ≤ q <mm), ∥ f | Lip∥ = ∥ f | Lip ([0.1] d) ∥ = ess sup {| f (x) | : x ∈ [0.1] D}. Sh.A. Balgimbaeva 59 Let φ = {φı | ı ∈ J} - a counting family of functions in lux, orthonormal in l2, and let {j (n) ⊂ j | n ∈N} such that j (n) ⊂ j (n+1) and #j (n) <Mm for all n ∈N, ∪n∈N J (n) = J. for f ∈ L1, we will consider the amount of Fourier according to the system φ in the form of sφn (f, x) = ∑ ı] 〈f, φı〉 φı (x), where 〈f, g〉 = ´ [0.1] d f (x) g (x) d x (z is the number, comprehensive conservation to z ∈C). For a set F ∈ LQ, we denote EN (F, φ, LQ) = SUP {∥ F —sulated (F, X) | LQ∥ | F ∈ F}. (1) We obtained (accurate in order) to assess the approximation of hyperbolically with the Crosses according to the ψ (D) classes of the Nicolsky-Besov and lysorkinatribel, set by the system of bursts with compact media, in the space of LQ ([0.1] D) for all kinds of values ​​of the parameters of classes and space. We introduce some designations. Let d ∈ N, zd = {1,. . . , d}; k ∈ N: k ≤ d. We fix the multi -core d = (d1, ..., dk) ∈ NK so that D1 + · · · + dk = d, and imagine x = (x1,., XD) ∈RD in the form of x = (x1, ., xk), where xκ ∈Rnκ, κ ∈ ZK. Denote ED = ED (0) = {0.1} D, Ed (1) = Ed {(0,., 0)}; Answers (D, J) = ZD ∩ [0.2 j −1] D, j ∈N0. Let the scaling function ψ (0) and the corresponding surge - function ψ (1) have a compact media: SUPPψ (0) ∪ SUPPψ (1) ⊂ [0.2n −1] for some n> 0; ψ (0), ψ (1) ∈C R (R). Further, a D-cut surge-system is defined as ψ (d) = {ψιασ (x) | ι ∈ ED (α), σ ∈ (D, α), α &0}, where ψιασ (x) = k∏ κ = 1 ψι ακσ κ (x κ), ψι κ jσκ (x κ) = 2 j dκ 2 ψι κ (2 j xκ --σκ); ψι κ (xκ) = ∏ ν∈K ψ (ιν) (xν), here ed (α) = ED1 (sign (α1)) ⊗ · · · ⊗edk (sign (αk)), σ (d, α) = σ (d1, α1) × · · · × σ (dk, αk). It is known that the systemψ (D) is orthonomated in L2 ([0.1] D). In addition, the ψ (d) system is an unconditional basis LQ ([0.1] D) at 1 <q <mm. In the case of k = 1, this fact is proved in [1, ch. eight]. The case K> 1 follows from here, because the system ψ (d) (according to the variable x) is a tensor product of the systems ψ (dκ) (according to alternating Xκ), κ ∈ ZK. 60 Materials of the International School-Conference We determine the operator ∆ψα (α ∈NK0) as follows: Let for f ∈ L1 ∆ α (f, x) = ∑ ι∈D (α) ∑ σλ (D, α) F ιασψ ι ασ (x) Diadic pack, where f ιασ = ˆ [0.1] d f (x) ψιασ (x) d x. In addition, for F ∈ L1, we determine its amount of Fourier according to the ψ (d) system by hyperbolic crosses (for fixed σ = (σ1,., Σk) ∈Rk+): S ψ, σ n (f, x) = ∑ ασ≤n ∆ ψ α (f, x) (n ∈N) (here ασ: = α1σ1 +.. + αkσk). Next, we will indicate the value (1) with Sψ, σn instead of sφn as e σ n (f, lq). Let 1 ≤ p, θ ≤و and let ℓθ ≡ ℓ ℓ (nk0) - the space of sequences of complex numbers (cα) = (cα α &0) with the final norm ∥ (cα) | ℓθ ∥ = (∑ α particle0 | cα | θ) 1/θ (1 ≤ θ <mm)
