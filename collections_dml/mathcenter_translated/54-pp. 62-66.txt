UDC 621.391.1: 519.6 Program implementation of the quick transformation of Fourier on the local fields of A.A. Baryshev1, G.A. Bondarenko2, D.S. Lukomsky3 1 Baryshevaa@gmail.com; Saratov National Research State University 2 GEBOND77@gmail.com; Saratov National Research State University 3 Lukomskiids@info.sgu.ru; The Saratov National Research State University discusses the implementation of a numerical algorithm for rapid discrete transformation of Fourier on local fields of positive characteristics. As an example of using the algorithm, image compression is given. Key words: discrete conversion of Fourier, local fields, numerical algorithm, image compression. This work is devoted to the issue of numerical implementation of the rapid transformation of Fourier in local fields, considered in the work of S.F. Lukomsky and A.M. Diver [1]. It should be noted that at present in information technology, algorithms are actively used that use various properties of Fourier transformation through various systems. We will consider the application of the algorithm on the example of compression of images. Under the local field K is understood the locally compact, quite incoherent, indiscriminate, complete topological space, which defines continuous operations "+̇", "·" - addition and multiplication, for which Axi A.A. Baryshev, G.A. Bondarenko, D.S. Lukomsky 63 fields of the field. An expenditure operator is introduced into the K field as follows. Single ball d = {x ∈ K: | x | ≤ 1}, µd = 1. is a ring in which there is the only maximum ideal b = {x ∈ K: | x | <1}. Element p ∈ B with the greatest norm | p | Call the primitive element. For him µb = | p | = 1P S, where P is simple, s ∈N. If x ∈D \ B, then | x | = 1. If for any a ∈ K, the product is d f = a +a +·, +a︸ ︷︷ ︸ p = 0, then the number P is called the characteristic of the field k. Let p - simple and s - natural. The final field GF (p s) consists of vectors a = (a (0), a (1), ..., a (s -1)), in which components a (j) take values ​​from 0 to p −1, The operation of addition is determined component by the module p. The local field k = f (s) of the positive characteristic P is isomorphic to many formal steppe rows a = φ∑ i = k ai t i, k ∈Z, ai ∈Gf (p s) operations of addition and multiplication are defined as the sum and work of such rows. It can be assumed that the local field f (s) characteristics P consists of infinite sequences a = (., 0n - 1, an,., A0, a1,.), A j ∈Gf (p s. ) in which only the final number of A J elements with negative numbers is excellent from zero.
