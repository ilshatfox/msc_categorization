) Energy characteristics and optimization of the parameters of the screen layer of dielectric with a periodic grate, let the endless P-periodic grille, consisting of thin metal stripes between them, are located in the plane Z = H. Under the grille in the plane Z = 0 is a metal screen. The area between the grate and the screen is filled with a dielectric. When designing integrated microcircuits and antenna microwave nodes, such a structure can be selected as a basic element. In this work, electromagnetic processes are investigated in a layer of dielectric. The task of diffraction of a flat wave falling on top of the grate is solved. Field flows are calculated, flowing through the sides of an elementary cell. Optimal conditions for entering radiation into a wave -water structure were found. 10. Consider the task of diffraction with a flat electromagnetic TE-polarized wave that falls on top to a lattice at an angle θ. We limit ourselves to the case when the field does not change along 228 tapes (∂/∂y = 0). Let the potential function of the falling wave f (0) (x, z) = Exp [ik0n1 (cos θ (z - h) - sin θx)]. (1) Then the potential functions F = Ey of the desired TE-Polyarized field must satisfy the Helmholtz equation, the conditions of interfaces on the boundaries of the media section, the boundary conditions on the metal and conditions at infinity. We will look for the waves that are leaving from the plane in the form of waves of the flock f (1) (x, z) = ger∑ n = − least an Exp [—Iβ1, n (z - h)] exp [i (β + qn) x], z> h, (2) above the lattice and f (2) (x, z) = φ∑ n = −mber bn sin (β2, nz) exp [i (β + qn) x], 0 <z. <h, (3) in a layer of dielectric, where β is the flock parameter, q = 2π/p and βj, n =   √ k2j - (β + QN) 2 if k2j - (β + QN ) 2 ≥ 0; −i √ (β + qn) 2 - k2j, if k2j - (β + qn) 2 ≤ 0. From the conditions of continuity of the fields on the grate cracks, it follows that β = −k0n1 sin θ. In this case, AN = BN SIN (β2, NH), N 6 = 0 and A0 + 1 = B0 SIN (β2,0H). Let us introduce new desigued coefficients CN = A, N 6 = 0 and C0 = A0 + 1. Lemma 1. The task of diffraction is equivalent to the paired summary equation φ∑ n = −mm cnγn exp (iqnx) = 2β1.0, 0 <x <d, (4) 229 ger∑ n = −mber cn exp (iqnx) = 0, d <x <p, (5) where γn = β2, n cth (iβ2, nh) + β1, n, n = 0, ± 1 ,. . . From the paired equation (4), (5) you can go to the endless system of linear algebraic equations, equating the coefficients of the Fourier of the functions on the left and right. The computing experiment showed that such a BLSA is an irregular system. Consider the method of regulating the problem using a special integral identity. Lemma 2. Let K1 (τ, x) = 1 p ux m = −mm 1 γm exp [iqm (x - τ)]. (6) Then, at 0 <x <p, the identity φ∑ n = − char exp (iqnx) = p∫ 0 (φ∑ n = − least cnγn exp (iqnτ)) K1 (τ, x) dτ is performed. (7) We denote IK = D∫ 0 Exp (Iqkτ) Dτ = {K = 0: D; K 6 = 0: EXP (IQKD) - 1 IQK}, JK = P∫ D Exp (IQKτ) Dτ = {K = 0: P - D; K 6 = 0: 1 - EXP (IQKD) IQK}. Theorem 1. The task of diffraction of a flat wave on a partially shielded layer is equivalent to blanu p2ck - φ∑ n = −mm cnγn φ∑ m = − et 1 γm jn --m - k = 230 = 2β1.0 ger m = − least 1 γm I --m IM -K, K = 0, ± 1 ,. . . (8) From identity (7) and equations (4) it follows that at 0 <x <d imes n = −mber cn exp (iqnx) = 2β1.0 p ux m = − organ 1 γm exp (iqmx) I --m + + 1 p φ∑ n = −mm cnγn φ∑ m = −mm 1 γm exp (iqmx) jn --m. (9) Equalizing the factors of the Fourier of the functions standing on the left and right in the pair equality (5), (9), we get BLLAU (8). The system of linear equations (8) with complex unknown CN can be solved in numerically by reduction. To solve the final Slau, the Gauss method is convenient with the choice of the leading element both on the line and the column. At the same time, in the amounts of indexes N and M were left according to N and M the terms, respectively. Calculations showed that the algorithm is stable with close values ​​of parameters N and M. It was established that with a given wavelength and the value of the angle of fall, the scattered field is completely determined by the mutual arrangement of the lattice tapes, as well as the width of the dielectric layer. 20. We select an elementary cell in a layer of a partially shielded dielectric - a rectangle of width P and height H. We calculate the flows of energy through its walls. For the left wall p = - 1 2ωµ0 re φ∑ n = –itute ger∑ m = −urb bnb ∗ m (β + qm) qnm, (10) where QNM = h∫ 0 sin (β2, nz) sin ∗ (β2 , mz) dz = 1 2 [g (β2, n - β ∗ 2, m) −g (β2, n + β ∗ 2, m)], 231 g (w) = h∫ 0 cos (wz) dz = {w = 0: h; W 6 = 0: Sin (WH)/W}. From the law of conservation of energy it follows that the flow of the poeting vector across the border of the selected rectangle is zero. Due to the periodicity of the structure, the flows of energy through the side walls of the cell will be equal in size, but directed in opposite directions in relation to the normal. Therefore, the flow of field energy through the upper wall should be equal to zero, that is, the energy falling on the structure of the wave should be fully reflected in the area above the grill. Calculations showed that, taking into account the error of the calculations, the law of conservation of energy φ∑ n = − least | 2 re β1, n = re β1.0 for an elementary cell is performed. It has been established that the direction of transferring the energy of
