The properties of the Fourier coefficients for the functions from class hω Let F (X) - 2π -periodic, integrated by the Lebeg on [0, 2π] Fourier with a row Fourier σ (f) = a0/2 + ger∑ n = 1 an cos nx + bn Sin NX. Then, with p> 0, we determine the quasinorm ‖f‖ap = | a0 | p 2 + ger∑ n = 1 | an | p + | bn | p. Next, we will assume A0 = 0, since this will not affect further considerations. Now let Hω = {F: ω (F, Δ) ≤ ω (Δ)}, where ω (Δ, f) is the continuity of the function f (x), i.e. ω (δ, f) = SUP | T | ≤p, 0≤x≤2π | f (x + t) - f (x) |, and ω (δ) - some continuous semi -adventive non -spray function for 0 ≤ Δ ≤ π ω (0) = 0. We will speak that the function ω (t) satisfies the conditions b and b ′, if there are constants C and C ′ accordingly (depending on ω (t)), such that φ∑ n = [1δ] +1 ω ​​(1 n) n ≤ Cω (δ) and δ [1δ] ∑ n = 1 ω (1 n) ≤ c ′ ω (δ) with δ ∈ (0, 1]. 91 if 0 <q <1, then put K (q) =      (q 1–q) q (0 <q ≤ 1/3) 1 2 (1+q 1–q) 1–q (1/3 <q ≤ 3/5) 22–qq ( 3 - q) −1 (1– q) 1–q (3/5 <q <1). Theorem. Let p ∈ (0, 2) and ω (t) - a continuity module that satisfies the conditions b and b ′. Then the inequalities are valuable b1 φ∑ k = 1 (ω (π k) √ k) p ≤ sup f’s ‖f‖ap ≤ b2 φ∑ k = 1 (ω (π k) √ k) P, where B1 = ( 20 √ 2 (3 2 C ′ + C + 6)) - P, B2 = 2K - 1 (p/2).

Salakhudinov (Kazan, rsalahudinov@ksu.ru) Small isoperimetric inequalities for the Euclidean moments of the region regarding the border The main result of the work is the clarification of isoperimetric inequalities from work [1] in the class of polygons with a fixed number of parties. It is well known that the classic isperimetric inequality between the area of ​​the region and its long border is specified for N - squares. In particular, classic isperimetric inequality can be obtained by the ultimate transition. A large number of classic and new small isoperimetric inequalities can be found in an article -review [2]. The work considers isperimetric inequalities for new geometric functionals of the region, which are 92
