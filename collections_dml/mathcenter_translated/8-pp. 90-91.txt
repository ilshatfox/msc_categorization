) Point transformations and equations of Penlevy is well known that the next class of differential equations of the second order y ′ ′ = p (x, y) + 3q (x, y) y ′ + 3r (x, y) (y ′) 2 + s 2 + s (x, y) (y ′) 3 (1) is closed relatively unpertured point transformations. This made it possible to build an effective classification of equations (1) in the work of [1] regarding the data of the Breaks of Blows. All six equations of Penlev, the coefficients of which are measorphic functions, belong to class (1), therefore, methods from [1] are applicable for their study. The main results: a) a classification of Penilee equations relative to unbearable point transformations; b) a necessary condition for equivalence of equation (1) of the Penlevse equation was found; c) for the equations of Penilev III and Penlev IV PIII: y ′ ′ = 1 y (y ′) 2 - 1 x y ′ + 1 x (ay2 + b) + cy3 + d y, piv: y ′ ′ = 1 2y (y ′ ) 2 + 3 2 y3 + 4xy2 + 2 (x2 - a) y + b y built a special necessary condition for the equivalence of the equations of type (1); d) Dan ([2]) an effective criterion for reducing the equations of the form (1) to the equations of Penlevy I and Penlev II Pi: Y ′ ′ = 6Y2 + X, PII: Y ′ ′ = 2Y3 + XY + A.
