-Convergence almost EVERYWHERE of DOUBLE FURIER SERIES N.Yu. Antonov  We consider one type of convergence of double trigonometric Fourier series intermediate between convergence over squares and λ-convergence for λ> 1. The well-known result on the convergence almost everywhere over squares of the Fourier series of functions from the class L(ln+ L) 2 ln+ ln+ ln+ l ([0.2π) 2) is extended to the case of λ-convergence for some sequences λ.

Keywords: limitations, averaging, compactness. This work provides examples showing that, unlike display with limited distortion [1] for display with an medium characteristic [2], in which the integrals ´ d k s i (x, f) | j (x, f) are finite | D X and ´ D K s (x, f) d X, limited multiplicity and degree on compacts from D generally speaking, does not take place. Consider the display with the S-medium characteristic [2]. Here are the following two examples. Example 1. Twisting around the Torah axis. In the space of R3, we consider Thor D, the points of which X = (X1, X2, X3) are described using curved coordinates: x1 = (r+r cosθ) cosφ, x2 = (r+r cosθ) sinφ, x3 = r sinθ, where 0 ≤φ <2π, 0 ≤ θ <2π, 0 <r <r, and r - a certain positive number. Let ρ (x) = √ x21 +x22. Designing through D1 circumference {x: ρ (x) = r, x3 = 0}. In the region D, we set the display 50 Materials of the International School-Conference F: (R, φ, θ) 7 → (r, φ, r pison), r ̸ = 0, where P is some arbitrary negative number, and put f (x) = x, if x ∈ D1. Display F is obviously continuous and limited in D. At the same time, it is locally homeomorphic at points x ∈ D, R ̸ = 0. All points of the set D1 Display F transfers into itself, and each circle with the center on D1, which lies in a two -dimensional plane , orthogonal D1, when displayed, also passes into itself. From this it is easy to see that the display f is openly and continuously differentiated at points x ∈ D \ D1 and J (X, F) = R P> 0. Since the 2-dimensional measure of the Label of the set D1 is zero and narrowing F to any straight line that does not pass through D1, continuously differentiated, then F is an ACL-point. If point X costs the circle described above once in any direction, then point F (x) will bypass the same circle in the same direction R P> 1 time. Now take a compact F ⊂ D, containing some points from D1. If y = (y1, y2, y3) = f (x), then y1 = (r + r cosr p) cosφ, y2 = (r + r cosr pθ) sinφ, y3 = r sinr pison. Therefore, on the circle (ρ (y) −r) 2 + y3 = r 2 there is at least m of prototypes of the set F. To do this, you need to choose R so that the ball of radius R with the center on D1 lies in many F and the whole part of [r p] the number r P is at least m. This means that the limitations on compact compacts of display F does not take place. Since j (x, f) 0 for x ∈ D \ D1, then n (y, f, g) = µ (y, f, g) for all sizes G, where n (y, f, g) - The multiplicity, and µ (y, f, g)-a degree or topological display index F relative to the point F and area G. Consequently, limitations on compacts to display F-display from the S-medium characteristic-does not take place. We will show further that the integrates that characterize the display with the S-medium characteristic converge (see [2]). Let α> 0, β> 0 are arbitrary numbers. We will make sure that you can choose p <0 so that the integrals ´ d k α I (x, f) | j (x, f) | d x, ´ d k β o (x, f) d x were finite. If x ∈ D1, then k βo = ki (x, f) = j (x, f) = 1. If x ∈ D \ D1, then j (x, f) = r p, ko (x, f) < (3+4π2p2) 3 2 r 2p, and since Ki (X, F) ≤ K 2O (X, F), therefore ´ D K α I (X, F) | J (X, F) | D X ≤ C2 ´ 1 0 r 2αp+p+1dr <mm. If 0> p> - 22α+1, ´ d k β i (x+f) d x <c3, as well as ´ 1 0 r 4βp+1dr <mm, if 0> p> - 12β. Thus, both of these integrals are finite simultaneously if 0> p> max { - 12β, - 22α+1}. Similarly, the following example is obtained 2. Twisting around the point. In the space of R3, we consider the area D, which is a ball x21 + x22 + x23 ≤ 1 with the center at the beginning of the coordinates and radius 1. In the region D, set the display f: (r, φ, θ) 7 → (r, φ, r pison ), if θ ̸ = 0, r ̸ = 0 and f (x) = x for x = 0. Note that in [3] examples and methods of finding a spherical module are given.
