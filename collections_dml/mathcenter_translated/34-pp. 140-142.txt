. Some results about the separation of the separation of Medvedev A. V. Kulakov Kazan State University, antonk_83@mail.ru Determination 1. Any class A ⊆ ωω everywhere certain functions is called a mass problem. Let A and B are massive problems. Then A 6M B and only when there is a calculated functionality φ, such that (∀g ∈ B) (∃f ∈ A) (grap (f) = φgraph (g)). Determination 2. Denote through SA, B = {χR | (A ⊆ r) & (b ∩r = ∅)} 142 Mass problem of the separation of a pair of non -overstrusting many (a, b). Put (A, B) 6S (C, D) ⇐⇒ SA, B 6M SC, D. Class A = {(C, D) | (C, D) ≡S (A, B)} is called the S-then pair (A, B). For S-spectacles A and B, we determine A 6 B until and only when there are pairs (A, B) ∈ A and (C, D) ∈ B, such as (A, B) 6S (C, D). We denote through DS the structure of all S-spectacles and through DT-the structure of all tuning degrees. Determination 3. A pair (A, b) is called computable transferred (V.P.), if A and B - V.P. sets. Accordingly, the S-spectacle A is called V.P., if there is V.P. pair (a, b) ∈ A. Let D0S denoting the structure of all V.P. S-spectacles. Determination 4. For any set A pair (A, A), we will call regular. Denote C0 = {x | φX (x) = 0}, C1 = {x | φX (x) = 1}. Fact 1. There is an isomorphic attachment I: dt - → ds, i (degt a) = degs (a, a), i.e. a 6t b ⇐⇒ (a, a) 6s (b, b). Fact 2. DS and D0S are the upper half -decisions. Fact 3. For any V.P. We pairs (a, b) have (a, b) 6s (C0, C1). Theorem 1. Any Nenlet V.P. The S-speck does not contain regular steam. Theorem 2 (density down). For any non-zero s thenzer B, there is a S-spectacle a, such that 0 <a <b. Investigation 2.1. There are no minimal S-spectacles. Investigation 2.2. DT is not isomorphic ds. 143 Theorem 3 (on the decomposition). Let (x, y) and (c, d) - such V.P. couples that (c, d) /∈ 0. Then there are V.P. sets A0 and A1 with properties (1) A0 ∩A1 = ∅ and A0 ∪A1 = x, (2) (2) (C, D) S (AI, Y), where I = 0, 1. Consequence 3.1. For any non -lwater V.P. S-spectacle b exist incomparable V.P. S-spectacle A0 and A1, such that B = A0 ∪ A1. Investigation 3.2. There are no minimum V.P. S-STO PENSE. Investigation 3.3. For any V.P. S-spectacle C, 0 <c <degs (C0, C1), there is V.P. S-spectacle, not comparable with c. Theorem 4 (about density). Let a, b - Nenolevo V.P. S-spectacle and a <b. Then there is V.P. S-spectacle C, that is, A <c <b. L and T R A T R A 1. Medvedev Yu.T. The degree of difficulties in mass problems // Dan USSR. - T. 104. - C. 501–504. 2. SOAR R.I.
