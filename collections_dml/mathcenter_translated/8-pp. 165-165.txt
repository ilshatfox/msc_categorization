) Evaluation of the error of interpolation with DM deposits in the final spaces, let ω is a limited area in RN with a lipsitic border, ∆ ω ω, h̄ = SUP X] Inf Yorn | X-Y |, H = Inf {| X-Y | : x, y ∈ ∆, x 6 = y}> 0, F ∈ W KP (ω), investments W KP (ω) → C (ω) and W KP (ω) → W LQ (ω), R, R, R, R, RUS t ∈ N, M = K + N + R, T ≥ M. The space l is introduced, consisting of a piece of polyinomial functions (regarding the breakdown of a certain cube containing ω into the smaller cubes of the diameter C1H) of global smoothness CT degree ≤ C2, where Ci = Ci (t) is some constants. Let S is a DM-display in the final space L, interpoling F on ∆ (see [1]). Theorem. If h̄ ≤ ah, then ‖dl (f - s) ‖lq (ω) ≤ c3h̄ϑωr (dkf, h̄) lp (ω), where c3 = c3 (ω, t, a) is constant, ϑ = min {k - k - k - k - k - k - k - k - k - k - k - k - k - k - min l, k - l - np + nq}, ωr - smoothness module r.
