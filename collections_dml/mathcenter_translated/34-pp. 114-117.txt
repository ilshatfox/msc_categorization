. Filtering convection in the channel with local heating and cooling the walls of E. I. Kalinin, A. B. Mazo Kazan State University, kalininei@yandex.ru The topic of the report is a numerical study of convective processes in a porous environment that arises in a tilt channel with local heating And cooling the walls. The channel of a single width is considered, inclined to go risontali on the angle α (Fig. 1). Rice. 1 On the boundaries of γ3 and γ4, the temperatures of −1 and +1 are maintained, respectively, the boundaries γ1 and γ2 are thermal insulated, at the entrance the temperature of the liquid is zero. 116 The Descartes Coordinates with an axis X is used, on the channel corrected along the lower boundary of the channel. The mathematical model of the studied process is based on the Darsy law and the equation of convective thermal conductivity. Within the framework of the bouredinel and linear law of thermal expansion, the fluid course is described by the following equations system [1, 2]: ∂T ∂T + ~ v · gradt = 1 pE ∆T, (1) ose ∆ψ = g (∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ T ∂x cosα - ∂t ∂y sinα), (2) vx = ∂ ∂y, vy = - ∂∂ ∂x. (3) Here T is the temperature of the liquid, t - time, ~ v = (vx, vy) - the speed of the current, PE - the number of bee, g - gravitational number. The problem was solved numerically by the method of final elements. The rectangle ω = [0, 12] × [0, 1] was accepted for the calculation area. At the same time, cooling and heating occurred at the boundaries at 3 <x <7. In Fig. 2 A presents the current lines ψ = const in the channel at α = 0 °, PE = 1, G = 20. It can be seen that closed vortex cells are formed at the entrance and exit from the heating and coolation zone. With an increase in the angle of inclination α to 90 °, the symmetry of the course relative to the axis of the channel is destroyed. In Fig. 2 b shows the case of the course in the strictly vertical channel (α = 90 °, PE = 1, G = 3). In the cooled area, we observe the formation of one vortex. With α> 90 °, the current acquires instability due to the fact that the heated boundary turns out to be cooled. This can lead to motor-coaling processes, consisting in continuous education, movement and destruction of vortices inside the heating-coilization zone. 117 in Fig. 2 C shows such a case in the horizontal channel at α = 180 °, PE = 1, G = 30. Fig. 2 The picture of the current fundamentally depends on the parameters PE, G and α. In Fig. 3 shows the curves g ∗ = g ∗ (α) and g ∗ = g ∗ (PE), separating the currents in which closed via are the crooked structures (G> G ∗, correspond to zone 1), from those in which closed vortex The cells do not arise (G <g ∗, they responsible zone 2). -90 0 90 1 2 3 1 2 α G* PE = 10 600 1200 0 10 20 2 1 PE G* α = 0 Fig. 3 118 Work was carried out with the support of the RFFI, project 04-01-00484.

On the numerical method of solving the mixed reverse edge problem of aerohydrodynamics I. M. Kamalutdinov Nimm named after N. G. Chebotareva Kazan State University, islamui@mi.ru in direct regional tasks of aerohydrodynamics of the roof profile is considered known, and it is required to find its aerodynamic characteristics with the specified parameters of the emerging flow. In the reverse tasks, the wing profile is found according to the distribution of speed or pressure set on its circuit. Such tasks are incorrect in Adamaru, and to solve them, the KVA KVA method is successfully used [1]. The marginal task of aerohydrodynamics is called mixed, if the part of the wing contour is known in advance about 119
