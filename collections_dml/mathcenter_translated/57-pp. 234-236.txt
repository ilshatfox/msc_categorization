Materials of the School-Conference of UDC 517.956 On the function of Riemann-Adamar for the equations of Bianchi A.N. Mironov1 1 miro73@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, the Elabuga Institute considered the tasks of Darbu for the equations of Bianchi of the third and fourth order. The corresponding functions of Riemann-Adamar are determined, allowing you to present the solutions to these problems in explicitly. The existence and unity of the functions of Riman Adamar has been proved. Keywords: Bianchi equation, Darbu's task, Riman-Adamar's function. The task of Darbu for a second -order hyperbolic equation with two independent variables was considered by many authors. You can indicate, for example, work [1], [2, p. 228–233], [3] - [5]. Here the issue of determining, the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding function of Riemann-Adamar for the equations of Bianchi of the third and fourth order, which are considered, for example, in the works [6]-[15]. The equation of Bianchi of the third order is a number of authors [11], [12], [13, p. 6], [14] calls the equation ux y z +a110 (x, y, z) ux y +a101 (x, y, z) uxz +a011 (x, y, z) uy z +a100 (x, y, z ) ux + +a010 (x, y, z) uy +a001 (x, y, z) uz +a000 (x, y, z) u = f (x, y, z). (1) We determine the class of functions C (k, l, m) as follows: function u ∈C (K1, K2, K3), if there are continuous derivatives ∂R1+R2+R3U ∂XR1∂YR2∂ZR3 (Ri = 0, .., ki). Class C (1.1.1) will be called regular. Let D is the area limited by the planes x = 0, y = 0, y = y0> 0, z = x, z = z0> 0. We believe that the coefficients of equation (1) satisfy the smooth conditions of ai j k ∈C (i, j , k) (D). We denote through x, y, t the face D at x = 0, y = 0, z = x, respectively. Darb's task for the Bianchi equation of the third order. In the field of D, find the regular solution of the equation (1), satisfying the boundary conditions u | x = ∗ (y, z), u | y = ng (x, z), u | t = ψ (x, y), ng (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) ( , 0) = ψ (0, y), ∗2 (x, x) = ψ (x, 0), ng (0, z) = ∗2 (0, z), ip (1.1) (x) (x) , ∗2 ∈C (1.1) (y), ψ ∈C (1.1) (t). This task is considered in [16]. Take the arbitrary point P (ctor, η, ζ) inside the region D. It determines the fins, which consists of two parts - the parallelepiped D1 and the prism of D2. We determine the function of the Rieman-Adamar Task Darbu H (X, Y, Z, ctor, η, ζ). Let h (x, y, z, ă, η, ζ) = {r (x, y, z, hole, η, ζ), (x, y, z) ∈ D1, v (x, y, z, z, z, z cil, η, ζ), (x, y, z) ∈ D2. A.N. Mironov 235, as a result of further reasoning, we come to the task of Darba to determine the function V with known boundary conditions. The solution to the specified problem Darbus exists and only. So, we can conclude that the function of Riemann-Adamar is determined for the Biana of the third order, and the only one exists in D. The presence of the function of the Rieman-Adamar allows you to build a solution to Darb's problem for the Bianka equation of a third order in explicit form.

(2) The coefficients of equation (2) depend on (x, y, z, t). The solution of the equation (2) of the class C (1.1,1,1) is called regular. Let G - an area limited by planes x = 0, y = 0, y = y0> 0, z = 0, z = z0> 0, t = x, t = t0> 0. We believe that equation coefficients (2) satisfy smoothness conditions AI J KL ∈ C (I, J, K, L) (G). We denote through X, Y, Z, S G at X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0, T = X, respectively. Darb's task for the Bianchi equation of the fourth order. In the region, find the regular solution of the equation (3), satisfying the boundary conditions u | x = ng, z, t), u | y = ng (x, z, t), u | z = ∗2 (x, y, t ), u | S = ψ (x, y, z), ∗1 (y, 0, t) = ng (0, y, t), ng (0, z, t) = ng (0, z, t) , ∗2 (x, 0, t) = ∗3 (x, 0, t), ng (y, z, 0) = ψ (0, y, z), ∗2 (x, z, x) = ψ (x, 0, z), ∗3 (x, y, x) = ψ (x, y, 0), onic (1.1,1,1) (x), onic (1.1.1) (y) , ip (1,1,1) (z), ψ ∈C (1,1,1) (S) (S). By the method of integrated equations, the existence and unity of the solution to the specified problem Darbu has been proven. Take the arbitrary point p (ă, η, ζ, τ) inside the region G). It determines the GP area limited by the planes x = 0, x = ctor, y = 0, y = η, z = 0, z = ζ, t = τ, t = x. Obviously, the GP area can be divided into two parts: G1, which is limited by the planes X = 0, X = ctor, Y = 0, Y = η, Z = 0, Z = ζ, T = τ, T = N; G2, which is limited by the planes x = 0, x = cil, y = 0, y = η, z = 0, z = ζ, t = ă, t = x. In the above three -dimensional case, they correspond to a parallelepiped and prism. We determine the function of the Rieman-Adamar Task Darbu H (X, Y, Z, T, ctor, η, ζ, τ) H (X, Y, Z, T, ctor, η, ζ, τ) = {R (X, Y) , z, t, hole, η, ζ, τ), (x, y, z, t) ∈G1, v (x, y, z, t, hole, η, ζ, τ), (x, y, y, y, y, y, y, z, t) ∈G2. The existence and unity of the function of Riemann-Adamar for the equation of Bianchi of the fourth order is proved. A formula has been built that gives a solution to the problem of Darba explicitly in terms of the functions of Riemann-Adamar. 236 Materials of the School-Conference Literature 1. Pulkin S. P.
