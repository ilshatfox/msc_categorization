Golubev Chuvash State Pedagogical University, Cheboksary, Stolyarovav@chgpu.edu.ru to the present in the mathematical literature of the geometry of the equipment immersed in n. -The size of the projective-metric coherence of KN, N, remained not studied. Consider the space of projective-metric coherence KN, N [2] with the invariant field of local absoluts QN-1: Aijx IXJ + (1/C) (GI0X I + CX0) 2 = 0, AIJ = AJI, C = Const 6 = 0; I, j, k, l, s, t = 1, n. 45 relative to normalized [3] (equipped in the sense of A.P. Norden [4]) the following results were obtained. Using invariant methods of differential-geometric studies (the method of external differential forms of E. Cartan [1] and the method of continuation and coverage of G. F. Laptev [2]) in the normalized space KN, N found the fields of tensors CI, Bij, λk, aijk, Bijk; At the same time, the Bij tensor is supposed to be unpertured, that is, the unexplored normalization of KN, N is considered. By analogy with the normalized projective space PN [4] and the space of projective connectedness pn, n [5] normalization of the space KN, N is called harmonic if the Bij tensor is symmetrical. With the help of the obtained tensor fields, the following sentences have been proved: the theorem 1. In the third differential surroundings, the unpertured normalization of the projective-metric coherence space KN, N induces three projective connectedness, corresponding to their projective relations 2 p n, n, 3 p n, n, 4 P N, N are also normalized in an unexpected manner and their base is the base of the initial space KN, N; In this case, induced spaces are dual [5] regarding the corresponding transformations IA (A = 1, 2, 3) of the forms of projective connectedness both among themselves and in relation to the original space KN, N; The ward of the normalization of one of the spaces KN, N, Q P N, N (Q = 2, 3, 4) entails the harmony of normalization of all others. Theorem 2. If the initial normalized space is KN, n without torsion (ri0st ≡ 0), then the requirement of the symmetry of the tensor 3 a ij (4 a ij) space without twisting 3 p n, n (4 p n, n) 46
