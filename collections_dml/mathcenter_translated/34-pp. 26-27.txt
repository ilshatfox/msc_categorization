One non -acerbolic equation with an integral condition by N. V. Bayin Samara State University, for_natatsar@mail.ru, we will consider for the UTT (X, T) - uxx (x, t) + c (x, t) equation. = 0 (1) in the area d = {(x, t): 0 <x <l, 0 <t <t} with the initial data of the cat u (x, 0) = onic (x), ut (x, 0 ) = ψ (x) (2) and non -valve conditions of the type ∫ l 0 ki (x) u (x, t) dx = 0, i = 1, 2, (3) where the functions are (x), ship (x) , φ (x) set. Studies of non -collar tasks with integral conditions have shown that even in the simplest cases, the system of its own functions is not full in L2, but in some cases it is possible to build a basis that stands from its own and attached functions. In the work, the conditions on the functions of Ki (X) were found, during which the task in L2 (0, L) has a rice basis, consisting of its own and attached functions. 28 Let U (X, T) - Solution of the problem (1) - (3). Multiplying the equalization (1) by the functions of Ki (X) and by which is dedicated by x from 0 to l, we get ki (0) ux (0, t) −ki (l) ux (l, t) +k ′ i (l) u (l, t) −k ′ i (0) u (0, t) = 0. (4) as follows from the work [1], [2], the condition for the existence of the basis of the task of the task (1), (2) - (4) is the enhanced regularity of the regional conditions (4). The conditions of enhanced regularity in the terminas of functions Ki (x) have the form K1 (L) K2 (0) −K1 (0) K2 (L) 6 = 0, or | K1 (0) K ′ 2 (0) +K1 (l ) K ′ 2 (l) | 6 = | k1 (l) k ′ 2 (0) +k1 (0) k ′ 2 (l) |, k1 (l) k ′ 2 (0) +k1 (0) k ′ 2 (l) 6 = 0 .
