The boundary analogue of the Torelli theorem for material-analytical functions 117 in the work of 1 yuul ~ rsn boundary analo1 · trout therapy for vestigan-ANA.RrITICH functions. It is shown that any materially · -Ya. -Palptic function F, specified on the border of the strictly convex region D in the multidimensional comic space and has the property of one -time holomorphic continued: along T.:M.M. PMs of complex lines, passing through one boundary point and intersection the area of ​​P, holomorphic continues in D as a function of many complex variables. Doc: The Jacket of the resulting statement is founded by the pref .: Tavlepia of the given function of Taylor nearby and equality zero of the coefficients under A. Tylomorphic degrees. The work was performed with financial submission, Yerzhks RFF (about ECT NO 12-01-00007-A).
