Setting the task of its own values ​​for the elliptical type equation in the flat area, limited by Zhordanova Krivoy P.V. Lopukhov Kazan State University discusses the setting of the problem for its own values ​​for the region that has an unnecessary border. Viner-Palei integrals are used on an indestructible curve. Consider a homogeneous regional task ([1], p. 329) −∇ (p∇u) + qua = λu, x ∈ G, (1) αu + β ∂u ∂n ∣∣∣∣ s = 0, (2) where G-an area limited by a piece of curve S. Let p (x) ∈ C1 (G), Q (X) ∈ C (G), P (X)> 0, Q (X) ≥ 0, X SER, α (x) ∈ C (s), β (x) ∈ C (S), α (x), β (x) ≥ 0, α (x) + β (x) 0, x ∈ S. (3 ) In the problem (1) - (3) you need to find the function u (x) ∈ C2 (G) ∪C1 (G), which satisfies the equation (1) in the area G and the boundary conditions (2) on S. Such a task can be considered as The task for its own values ​​λ for the operator l = ∇ (p∇u) + QU with the area of ​​the determination ML, which contains the functions U ∈ C2 (G) ∪ C1 (G) that satisfy the condition (2) and the condition LU ∈ L2 (G ). If u ∈ C2 (g) ∪ c1 (g) and v ∈ C1 (G), then the first formula of the Green ∫ g vludx = ∫ g p∇u∇v - ∫ s pv ∂u ∂ g quindx ( 4) 194 P.V. Lopukhov where the integral on the left is understood as unacceptable. If U, V ∈ C2 (G) ∪ C1 (G), then the second formula of Green ∫ G (vlu - ulv) dx = ∫ s p (u ∂v ∂n - v ∂u ∂n) ds is fair. (5) From the second formula of Green and the boundary conditions (2) it follows that the operator L is the Hermites. From the first formula of Green and conditions (3) it follows that the operator l is positively defined. Therefore, all the operator’s own values ​​are non -negative, and their own functions that meet different values ​​are orthonotal, and these functions can be chosen by material. Let's move on to the integrated setting of the task on our own values. We choose a single -bonded region, limited by a piece of curve L, and consider the edge of the ∇2u (x) + λu (x) = 0, x ∈ D, (6) u | l = 0, x ∈ L, (7) here u ∈ C2 (D) ∪C (D). Letug (x, y) - the function of the Green Laplace operator for region D. Then the task (6) - (7) can be reduced to finding its own values ​​of the integral equation U (y) - λ ∫ d g (x, y) u (x) dx1dx2 = 0, x = (x1, x2) ∈ D. (8) in the formulas of Green, integrals are used according to the curve γ of the type ∫ γ uds, γ ∂u ∂n ds. If γ is an indestructible curve, then neither the DS length or normal → n element is determined for it. In the works [2] - [4] the following scheme for building an integral according to an indestructible curve γ. Let γ - a simple closed Zordanov curve on a complex plane that breaks it into areas D+ and D - so that φ ∈ D -. Let the continuous function F (Z) be set on γ. If it is followed by 195 on the setting of the task for its own values. . . Γ continuous in d+ functions u (z) with integrated first derivatives, then by definition ∫ γ f (z) dz = - ∫ d+ ∂u ∂z dzdz. (9) Such an integral can be calculated if its density can be continued from the curve γ to the D+region. In the works [2] - [4], continuations are built for functions from the classes Ha (γ) (gelder functions with indicator ν), hν (γ) = {f (t) ∈ C (γ): | f (t1) - f (t2) || T1 - t2 | ν <mm, t1, t2 ∈ γ}. (10) in [4] it is shown that subject to ν <dmγ, the continuation of the Whitney functions f (x) ∈ Ha has integrated VD+ derivatives, and the right part (9) does not depend on the choice of continuation. Here DMγ is the characteristic of the curve γ, called the upper metric dimension. We agree to call such an integral external. In the theory of stochastic integration, integral on the Browned trajectory t → b (t), t ∈ [0, 1] is determined like this (see [5]): ∫ 1 0 e (t) db = e (t) b (t) | 10 - ∫ 1 0 e ′ (t) b (t) dt, (11) E (t) ∈ C1 ([0, 1]). This definition is easy to transfer to Zordanov, a curve on the plane. Let the simple Zordanova curve γ ∈ R2 are parametrically as a pair of continuous functions x (t), y (t), t ∈ [0, 1]. Then, by definition, ∫ 1 0 p (t) dx +q (t) dy = p (t) x (t) +q (t) y (t) | 10– - ∫ 1 0 (p ′ (t) x (t) (t) t) +q ′ (t) y (t)) dt. (12) Using the determination of the Winner-Palel integral, you can build an integral from a normal derivative of the function F (x) by an indestructible curve γ: γ ∂f ∂n ds = ∂f ∂x (t) + ∂f ∂y (t) y (t) ∣∣∣∣ 1 0 - 196 pp. Lopukhov - ∫ 1 0 (∂f ∂x ′ (t) y (t) - ∂f ∂y ′ (t) x (t)) dt. (13) Using the Viner-Palei integral, we will distribute Green's formulas on the area with an indestructible border. On the desired function U (x) and its boundary values ​​will need to be applied additional restrictions. Consider the regional task of the first kind - ∇ (p∇u) + qua = λu, x ∈ G, (14) u | s = 0, x ∈ S, (15) where G is the area limited p (x) ∈ C1 (g), q (x) ∈ C (G), p (x)> 0, Q (x) ≥ 0, x ∈ G. (16) with a rigid requirement U (x) ∈ C2 (G) The solution to the problem may not exist. In the integrated setting of the task for our own values, we can weaken the conditions for the function U (x). As you know, from the theorems of Riemann and Karateodori (see [6]) it follows that the function of Green for a flat area with a jordan border exists. Indeed, the construction of Green's function in the case of a flat area comes down to p
