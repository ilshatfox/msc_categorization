Lisachenko Nizhny Novgorod State University, lismisha@yandex.ru The report is devoted to the regulatory of the classic uzawa algorithm in the quadratic task of optimal management with very convex functionality and linear restrictions. Let U be a convex compact in RR, D ≡ {U ∈ LIU [T0, T]: U (T) ∈ U P. B. on [t0, t]}. The problem I0 (u) → min, II (u) = 0, i = 1, m, II (u) ≤ 0, i = m + 1, k, (1) i0 (u) ≡ ∫ t0 (〈〈〈〈〈〈〈≡ 〈≡ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ A0 (t) x [u], x [u] (t)〉+ 〈b0 (t) u (t), u (t)〉) dt, ii (u) ≡ t0 (〈ai (t), x [u] (t)〉+ 〈bi (t), u (t)〉) dt, i = 1, k, 89
