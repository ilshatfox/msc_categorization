One class of axial-symmetric solutions in the theory of gravity with the scalar field P.E. Kashargin, S.V. Sushkov Kazan State University, Serge.sushkov@ksu.ru is devoted to the construction of axial symmetric rites in the framework of the general theory of relativity in the source of gravity in The form of a massless scalar field φ. The action of the theory has the form S = ∫ D4X √ —G [1 8π R - εgµνφ, µφ, ν], (1) where R is the scalar curvature, Gµν - metric tensor, ε = ± 1. The following equations of the gravitational and scalar fields correspond to the action (1): Rµν = 8πεφ, µφ, ν, ∇α∇αφ = 0. (2) The solution of the system of equations (2) is built in a special class of axial-symmetric meters [1] DS2 =-- F (DT + A COS θ Dear) 2 + 1 F [DL2 + K (Dθ2 + Sin2 θ D accord)]], where F, K is the functions of one variable L and A - parameter. The solutions obtained in the work can be divided by three times personal algebraic classes by type of function K. Class A. K = L2 + L20 (L0 6 = 0), F = 2φ0L0BE φ0U A2 + B2e2φ0u, φ = u √ φ20 + 4 16π, 121 where φ0, l0, b are the integration constants, u = u (l) = arctg (l/l0) and ε = −1. Class B. K = L2, F = 2φ0BE φ0/L A2 + B2E2φ0/L, φ = φ0 l √ 16π. Here ε = −1. Class C. K = L2 - L20 (L0 6 = 0), F = 2φ0L0BE φ0U A2 + B2E2φ0U, U = 1 2 LN L0 L + L0. The solution for the field φ in this case has different views in the visibility from the size ε: φ = u √ 4 - φ20 16π, ε = +1; φ = u √ φ20 - 4 16π, ε = −1.
