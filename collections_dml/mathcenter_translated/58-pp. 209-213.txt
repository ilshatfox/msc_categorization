The Linear Conjugation Problem O.V. CHERNOVA The Special Case of the Linear Conjugation Problem for a General Elliptic Systemwith Complex CoEFICIENTS IS Considered. It is shown that the choice of a successful invertible linear substitution allows to reduce the general elliptic system to an equivalent canonical system, while the initial boundary condition is expressed in terms of elements of some auxiliary matrices. Applying the Results of the Classical Theory of Singular Operators and Number of Auxiliary Statements, The Fredholm Solvavability of the Problem Is Established.

The surfaces of constant average curvature are described using elliptical integrals. Key words: surfaces of rotation, average curvature, elliptical integrates in the Euclidean space E 3 Consider the surface of rotation M obtained by rotation of a flat curve around the axis. We denote through K = (0.0.1)-the ORT of the axis, and through E = (COS (V), Si N (V), 0)-the radius vector of a single circle located in the plane, orthogonal axis. 210 “Lobachev readings - 2019” Then the surface of the rotation m can be set in the form of r = ue (v) + f (u) k, where f = f (u) is a differentiated function, u, v - parameters. We denote through n - orth normal to the surface m. Then n = f (u) ′ e (v) −kp (f (u) ′) 2+1. The main curvatures K1, K2 surfaces M have the form K1 = - F (U) ′ ′ √ (F (U) ′) 2 +13, K2 = - F (U) ′ U √ (F (U) ′) 2 +1 . (1) We have a differential equation of the rotation surface of constant Gaussian curvature (PGK) K F (u) ′ f (u) ′ ′ u (f (u) ′) 2 +1) 2 = k. (2) demanding k = const, we get solutions f (u) = ± ∫ u 0 √ k t 2 - (C −1) C −k t 2 d t. f (u) = ± ∫ u 0 √ k t 2 - (c −1) C −k t 2 d t, k, c = const. (3) in [1, p. 97] The form of the meridian was investigated without resorting to calculating the elliptical integral. We have F (u) = ∓ i p c −1el l i pti ce (u p c c, p (c -1) c - c -1) p k + c1, k, c, c1 = const. (4) We believe K = 1. We have f (u) = ± ∫ u 0 √ t 2 - (c −1) c - t 2 d t, f (u) = ∓i p c −1ell i pti ce (up c, p (c −1) c −1) + c1, (5) n = ± √ u2 - c + 1e (v) - √ c --u2k. (6) To build the surface of constant average curvature, we use the Bonne theorem [2, p. 110]: For any surface that has a constant positive Gaussian curvature, there is a surface parallel to it with a constant average curvature. The surface of constant average curvature (PSK), parallel to the surface of rotation (PGK), is determined by the equation [1, c. 307] r̄ = r + hn, h = ± p k = ± 1. Surfaces (PSK) are the surfaces of rotation. 2. Examples of rotation surfaces (PSK) will first build the surfaces of rotation (PGK). The surfaces of rotation (PGK) are examined by three types [1, c. 97]. The surfaces of rotation (PSK) parallel to them also have three types. 2.1. The first type of rotation surface (PSK). Put in (5) c = 1, f (u) = ± p 1 --u2. Meridian - circumference of the rotation surface (PGK) - sphere. The corresponding surface of the rotation (PSK) is also the corresponding sphere. M.A. Czechkov 211 2.2. The second type of rotation surface (PSK). From (5), we notice that the function f (u) is determined by 0 <c <1. Considering C = 1/4, we get f (u) = ± p 3 2 el l i pti ce ( 2u, 1/p 3I) + c1, n = ± √ u2 + 3/4e (v) - √ 1/4-u2k. (7) Consider the surfaces of the rotation of constant Gaussian curvature M1, M2, M3, M4. Denote F (u) = - p 3 2 EL L I PTI CE (2U, 1/ P 3I), A = F (PC) = - P 3/ 2ell i Pti CE (1/ P 3I). Put m1: r (u, v) = (ucos (v), usi n (v), - f (u)), m2: r (u, v) = (ucos (v), usi n (v), F (u) −2a), m3: r (u, v) = (ucos (v), usi n (v), - f (u)+2a), m4: r (u, v) = (ucos (ucos (ucos (ucos v), usi n (v), f (u)), u ∈ [0, p 1/4], v ∈ [−π, π]. We build these surfaces (Fig. 1). –0.4 –0.2 0.2 0.4 –0.5 0 0.5 –3 –2 –1 0 1 2 3 Fig. 1. Models of surfaces PGK M1, M2, M3, M4, C = 1/4 for these surfaces we build the surfaces of constant average curvature m̄1, m̄2, m̄3, m̄4. We determine the normal N1, N2, N3, N4 for these surfaces. n1 = n3 = - √ u2 +3/4e (v) - √ 1/4 --u2k, n2 = n4 = √ u2 +3/4e (v) - √ 1/4-u2k. We believe h = 1. Equations of surfaces m̄1, m̄4 have the form m̄1: r (u, v) = (u - √ u2 +3/4) e (v) + (−f (u) - √ 1/4-u2) k, m̄4: r (u, v) = (u + √ u2 +3/4) e (v) + (f (u) - √ 1/4 --u2) k. We build these surfaces (Fig. 2). –1.5 –1 –0.5 0.5 1 1.5 –1 0 1 –1.5 –1 –0.5 0.5 1 1.5 Fig. 2.
