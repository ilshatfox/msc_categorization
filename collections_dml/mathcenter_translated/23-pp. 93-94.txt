) The spectrum of one family of operators on a variety of laying Make M.S. - a variety with the placement of F, generated by the local free action of the switching group H. Let the integrated connectivity of the Eresman is set on (m, f), invariant regarding the action of H. Consider the Operator = - D2 DX2 +V by l2 (h × p), determined for each layer of fraction f, where V ∈ C0 (M), that is, h determines the family of Schrödinger operators (hp) p either, hp: l2 (rn) → l2 ( Rn), where n = dim h. Using the apparatus of the presentation of Flok [1], the following series of statements can be proved. Drying 1. Let H - compact group. Then the spectrum of the Schrödinger operator h = - D2 dx2 +V continuously depends on the parameter p ∈ P. Drying 2. Schrödinger operator spectrum h =-d2 dx2 + v, where V is evenly a periodic function, there is a limit (cebicated) spectra of operators HN =-D 2 dx2 + VN, where VN is periodic functions, such that it is such that it is that Vn → v (n → φ) according to the norm ‖f‖ = sup {| f (x) || x ∈ R} in the sense [2]. Consequence. If the HP retains some metric on the transversal p, then the spectra of the Schrödinger operators family change continuously. Comment. Such statements are easily transferred in the event of integrated potentials V: M → C. This can be done using the results [3], [4]. Drying 3. Let the transversal p 'rn and ∀x 6 = 0 hx = nz (n ∈ N), h0 = z. Then: 1) the spectrum of the family of one -dimensional operators of the Schrödinger with periodic materially valuable potentials of the homeomorphone l × sn -1, where l is L is Combining the functions of FI: r → r i ∈ N, fni+k (x) = = k - 1 arctan (x), fni = 0, k = 1,. . . - N - 1, i ∈ N. 2) Let ∆ ′ X (e) 6 = 0 for all x ∈ P and e ∈ λx (λx is the spectrum of the operator at point x ∈ P). If the V is a complex function, then the arcs of the spectrum of the operator with a larger period can pass into each other when turning around the point 0 ∈ P only if the operator in the 0 spectrum contains a closed analytical arc.
