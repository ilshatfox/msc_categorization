AZ Work is devoted to modeling the process of extracting retrograde condensate from the bottomhole zone of the gas condensate well by heating “dry” hydrocarbon gas into it. Modeling the process about the binary on the binar model of filtering the gas condensate mixture and special experimental studies, as a result, a new approach and algorithm for calculating the process of removing condensate from the sinking zone of the “dry” gas gas for deep -wired gas condensate deposits have been developed. The foregoing made it possible to study the following issues at the measure of a specific deep -sized gas condensate field: 1. Explore the process of accumulation of retrograde condensate in the prize of the boyfriend of the well and establish the pattern of changing its content by the extension of the formation; 2. Calculate the technological indicators of the “dry” carbohydrate of the native gas into the intake zone of the layer and study the mechanism of the evaporation of retrograde condensate during the pumping process. At the same time, it was found that the pumping of the “dry” gas into the intake zone of the layer according to the proposed technology provides an increase in the production of producing wells almost twice and for a long time. 260
