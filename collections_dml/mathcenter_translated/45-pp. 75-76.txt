The algorithm for constructing a multi-party, which determines the area of ​​convergence of the integral of Mellin-Barns, representing the solution of the pentanomy algebraic equation, we consider the NSTANOMIAL algebraic equation 75 from the result of Melli1sh. [1] It is known that the µ degree (µ>> o) the branch of the solution y (x) y (o) = 1 seems to be the integral of Mellin-Barns of the type: (2) 1 de Integration is carried out according to imaginary (vertical) under space 1 + IJR3, the Vector 'from the fixed and selected from the Simplex to the rabpgs [2j: Yu dokuano, that NRI is the condition of <2N2 INTS l'JJi (2) converges above the inside of the day -trial worker (see Fig. 1). It can degenerate into a tenth -game and parallels of the NRI NRI corresponding conditions for Ryu: T'3Atsli Monomas and equation (1). 76 t. V. Zizovl in this work based on this result with the buildings of the computer algebra algorithm in the Maple environment. During the execution of the program, a duodengine nickname is built (a ten -sided, parallelepiped), which determines the finish of the integral (2), representing the solution of the Pentanomy algebraic equation (1). The MA program consists of several procedures, the main Domain_for procedure _pentanomial_algebraic_eqis is implemented according to the structure of the polyhedron. The input data of the procedure is the indicators of the monomas of the pentanomy algebraic equation. In Fig. 1 presents one of the results of the program. A, Fig. 1. The duodenum p <2N2.
