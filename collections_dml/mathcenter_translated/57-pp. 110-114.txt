UDC 517.53/.55, 537.8 Quaternionic methods in electrodynamics Yu.A. Gladyshev1 1 v572264@yandex.ru; Kaluga State University named after K.E. Tsiolkovsky in the article provides a generalization of the well-known conditions of Koshi-Riman into many twice continuously differentiated functions determined in a certain area of ​​the eight-dimensional space of the R8 with values ​​in the body of quaternions. A number of their properties are given. The generalization of calibration transformations of the system potentials was introduced in quaternionic form. The electrodynamic interpretation of the main results is given and the connection with electromagnetic potentials is shown. Key words: quatternions, electrodynamics, calibration transformations. The messages [1], [2] introduced the generalization of the functions of the complex variable conditions of the Koshha-Riman on functions with quaternionic values, determined in a certain area of ​​the eight-dimensional space R8, where x J ∈ R8, J = 0.7. Let χ, ψ - two quatternion functions χ = χ0 + 3∑ j = 1 e j, ψ = ψ0 + 3∑ j = 1 e jψ J, where e j (j = 1.3) is quaternionic units [1]. Preserving the equivalence of all directions in the R8 space for convenience, we denote the last four axes via y j, that is, y j = x j+3, j = 0.3. The subspace x j, j = 0.3 denote X, and y j = x j+3, j = 0.3 through y. Given the development of the concept of the Koshosh-Riman system [2], we will write down the generalized system as {d1χ --ψd2 = 0, χd2 + d1ψ = 0. (1) where the quaternionic operators D1, D1, D2, D2 are determined by expressions D1 = ∂x0 + 3 3 ∑ J = 1 E j ∂x j, d2 = ∂ ∂y0 + 3∑ j = 1 e j ∂y j, and the feature of the quaternionic conjugation is indicated. It is easy to make sure that D1D1 = D1D1 = 3∑ J = 0 ∂2 ∂x2 J, D2D2 = D2D2 = 3∑ J = 0 ∂2 ∂Y2 J. (2) Yu.A. Gladyshev 111 Thus, D1D1 +D2D2 = ∆8 is the Laplace operator in R8. For further, it is useful to paint the effect of these operators to the quatternion Q = Q0 + ∑3 J = 1 Q J E J, using the expressions of vector analysis, namely D1q = ∂Q0 ∂x0 −DIV (x) q⃗ + ∂q⃗ ∂x0 —Grad (x) Q0 + ROT (x) Q⃗, (3) QD2 = ∂Q0 ∂Y0 −DIV (Y) Q⃗ + Grad (Y) Q0 + ∂Q⃗ ∂Y0 - ROT (Y) Q⃗. (4) The so -called attached system [2] {d1χ̃ + ̃̃d2 = 0, ̃̃d2 + d1̃ = 0, obtained from (1) replacement D1, D1 with operators D2, D2, was introduced. Assuming that the components χ j, ψ j ∈ C (2) and taking into account (2), we can make sure that all components satisfy the Laplace equation in the R8, that is, they are harmonic functions. The quaternion, all the components of which are harmonic functions, will call harmonic. Some properties of the system (1), which open the possibility of constructing an endless sequence of its solutions, are indicated in [2]. In [2] it is shown that the decision (1) can be recorded if α, β - harmonic quatternions, as {χ = d1α +βd2, ψ = −αd2 +d1β. (5) In [2] it was proposed to be called α, β quaternionic potentials. Potentials α, β can be found with an accuracy of τ̃, θ̃ quaternions that satisfy the homogeneous attached system {d1τ̃ + θ̃d2 = 0, –τ̃d2 + d1θ̃ = 0. (6) by considering (5) as a heterogeneous system of equations, general solution α, β write down as the sum of a certain private decision α ′, β ′ system (5) and the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous system {α = α ′+ τ̃, β = β ′+ θ̃. (7) In applications to classical electrodynamics, it is customary to call this a calibration transformation of potentials. According to [2], the decision (6) can be expressed through arbitrary harmonic quaternion ω. Since ω has a scalar and vector part, we will distinguish between the scalar and vector calibration transformation ω = ω0 + 0⃗, ω = 0+ ω⃗. (8) 112 Materials of the School-Conference in the first case, using (3), (4), we find τ̃ = d1ω0 = −gradω0, θ̃ = ω0d2 = ∂ω0 ∂y0. For vector calibration transformation based on the property specified in [2], we will write τ̃ = −divω⃗+ rotω⃗, θ̃ = ∂ω⃗ ∂y0. For an electrodynamic interpretation of the system (1), we accept that χ, ψ is vector quaternions, and put χ⃗ = h⃗, ⃗⃗ = i e⃗, χ0 = ψ0 = 0. From the main system (5), using (3), (4) The famous Maxwell system follows [3]. Similarly, assuming χ⃗ = h⃗, ⃗⃗ = −i e⃗, x0 = i t, (9) with the actual Y1, Y2, Y3, we get the Maxwell system in these variables. Two more possibilities arise with imaginary y j (x j), j = 1.3 and real x0 (y0). Choose potentials for the first case should be in the form α = 0 - a⃗, β = –i pul + 0⃗, (10) this choice leads, according to (3), (4), to the usual expressions of the bonds of tension and potentials χ = h + h⃗ = h⃗ = diva⃗ - ∂icle ∂y0 + rota⃗, e⃗ = — ∂a⃗ ∂t –gradarent. (11) In order to obtain conventional ratios for h⃗ h⃗ = rota⃗ from (11), we require that diva⃗+ ∂ venters ∂t = 0. This condition is usually called the condition of the Lorentz. B (8) was shown the receipt of a quaternionic calibration transformation, when the scalar quatternion ω0 was taken as the main harmonic function. Recall the main results: τ⃗ = gradω, θ0 = ∂ω0 ∂t. We will substitute these expressions
