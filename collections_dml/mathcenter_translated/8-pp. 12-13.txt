) The local structure of the surface of the internal conformal radius for the single -link region The internal conformal radius R (D, b) of the area D on the complex plane Z at point b ∈ D is equal to the radius of the circle, which is the image D with a conformal display ζ = f (z) with normalization F (b) = 0, f ′ (b) = 1 ([1], p.18). Exactly, r (d, b) = | f (t) |, t ∈ ∂d; Through the reverse function z = f -1 [r (d, b) eiβζ] = f [(ζ + a)/(1 + aζ)] in the circle E = {ζ: | ζ | <1} The performance R (D, B) = R (F (E), F (A)) = | F ′ (A) | (1– | A | 2), B = F (A), D = f (e). The report shows the results of local behavior along the upper conformal radius R (D, b) above the area D and surface R (F (E), F (ζ)) above the circle E. Given the estimates and interpretations of the coefficients in the decompositions of conform radii in small the environs of points a ∈ E and B ∈ D. For some classes of single -leafy areas D, conclusions are drawn about the structure of the entire surface of the conformal radius R (D, b) or surface with the equation ω = 1/R (D, b) = λ (D, B ) for the density of hyperbolic metric λ (D, b). Theorem 1 states the bulge down of the surface λ (f (e), f (ζ)) above the circle E, provided that Schwarzian | {f, ζ} | ≤ 2/(1 - | ζ | 2). Theorem 2 is guaranteed a local convex down the surface λ (f (e), f [(ζ+a)/(1+aζ)]) above the point A in the class of non -shary (| {f, ζ} | ≤ 2/(1- | ζ | 2) 2, ζ ∈ E). In the same class, non -haryri on the surface λ (f (e), z) above the area d = f (e) lines that walk monotonously up this surface (theorem 3) were found. 12 Along the way, a new justification of two inequalities for convex displays F (ζ), ∈ ∈ E, which are recorded in the form (1- | ζ | 2) 2 | {f, ζ} | ≤ 2 - | (1 - | ζ | 2) f ′ ′ (ζ)/f ′ (ζ) - 2ζ | 2/2 ⇒ {f, ζ} | ≤ 2/(1 - | ζ | 2) 2. In evidence, known spectacular characterization (for example, the dissertation [2] and the bibliography for it): 1. ω = r (d, z) - the equation convex upwards (urb /∈ D) ⇐⇒ D - convex region; 2. ω = R (D, Z) - the equation of the surface convex down (φ ∈ D) ⇐⇒ C \ D is a convex area.
