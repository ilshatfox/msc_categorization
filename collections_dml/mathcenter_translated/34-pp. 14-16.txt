Akhmerov Bashkir State University, Ufa in L2 (0, π) Consider the operator h = h0 + v, where h0 = −d2/dx2, V is the multiplication operator by the material function V (x) ∈ L2 (0, π). In the future, the operator H is generated by one of the following conditions: a) u (0) = u (π) = 0; b) u ′ (0) = u ′ (π) = 0; c) u (0) = u ′ (π) = 0. 16 in [1] is the method for determining the own numbers of the Rutor H, based on the asymptotic representation of the STR (x, t, λ) = r 0 (x, t, λ) - (λn - λ) −1fn (x) fn (t) nuclei of the resolvengers R0 (λ) of the uninocked operatorh0 in the vicinity of its own numbers, where λn is the own values ​​of the opera H0, fn (x) are the corresponding normalized owners functions. In [2], the asymptotic spectrum of the operator h = (h0) n + v was obtained, where n> 1, n ∈ N. Let λn - the operator’s own values ​​H 0, µn - the operator’s own values ​​of the operator H. Using the method of finding the formulas of regulators Traces for abstract self -combined operators in a guilbert about a wanderings proposed in [3], the following statement can be obtained. Let V (x) ∈ L2 (0, π). Then there is a trace formula φ∑ n = 0  µn - λkn - 1 π π∫ 0 v (x) dx   = χ (v (0) + v (π)) 4 + χ χ π∫ 0 v ( x) dx, where k> 1, k ∈ N, a) λn = n2, χ = 1; b) λn = n2, χ = 1; c) λn = (n+ 1/2) 2, χ = 0.

R. Akhtyamov, Kazan State University when digitizing originals with partial damage (inscriptions and spots in photographs, breaks and scratches) in the pixel mass appear with distorted values ​​corresponding to the damaged area of ​​the original. Restoring the image involves the correction of given in these areas. The interpretation of the task of restoring images as a special incident of the fluid movement, obeying the Vesier -Kostok equation, served as the basis for creating a well -known recovery algorithm [1]. In this work, another algorithm for recovery of images. The idea was the process of continuing the harmonic function from the grade into the region by the Libman method [2]. The image is considered as a vector-function from two arguments, the values ​​of which are color components in the selected color model. Although with this approach, the function is specified on a discrete set of points, after about the sedura of interpolation it can be considered as smooth 18
