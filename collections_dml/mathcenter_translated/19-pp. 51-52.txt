The velocities of the Butstr AP AP APPRETION for a sequence of random values ​​sets the speed of convergence (in the spirit of complete convergence from the works of Baum - Katz, Su - Robbins, Spitzer) for the boots of the media. Random values ​​are not supposed to be independent:-. 1y: Vsh or the same sister: Rennaya. Moreover, conditions for moments or joint distributions are not imposed. S. S.
