The analogs of the Faber-Shauder system system is called the function of the functions φ = {onic (x)} و = 0, x ∈ [0, 1], in which ∗0 (x) = 1– x, ivil (x) = x , x ∈ [0, 1], and with n = 2k + i, k = 0, 1, ..., i = 1, 2, ... 2k onic (x) = onic i k (x) =                0, x /∈ (i -1 2k, i -1 2k) 1, x = 2i-1 2k+1 line and continuous on [ I -1 2K, 2i - 1 2k+1] [2i-1 2k+1, I -1 2K] This system consisting of continuous functions is one of the simplest bases in space C [0, 1]. In the works [1], [2] some generalizations of this system are given. We will consider the smooth analogue of the Faber Shauder system as a compression and shift system F2 (x) = ∫ x 0 ∫ t1 0 w3 (t) dtdt1, where W3 (t) is the Walsha function, and we will study the issue of the basis of this system in space C [ 0, 1]. About the convenience ffic (x): = f2 (x) and we will consider the compression and shifts system ton, j (x) = onic (2 nx - j) theorem. The system ement, j (x) is the basis of the space C0 [0, 1] and the inequality of 164 I. M. Shakirov | f (x) - s2n+j (x) | 6 ωf (1 2n+2)+ω2f (1 2n+2).
