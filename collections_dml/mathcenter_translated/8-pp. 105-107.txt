Into -polishing in the Lagrange at the extreme points of the polynomials of Chebyshev, the report consists of three parts. In the first part, the known results on the approximations of interpolation by 105 polynomials of LN LN (f; x) = n∑ k = 0 f (xk) lk (x), f ∈ C [−1; 1], xk = cos kπ n, (1) where LK (x) - fundamental polynomials in extreme points of polynomials of Chebyshev I - kind. The second part of the report will set out new results in this area. To illustrate, we formulate some of them. Let l2 (ρ) = l2 (ρ; [−1; 1]) - swagger space on [−1; 1] with the Chebyshevsky weight ρ = ρ (x) = (1–x2) −1/2 and with the usual norm, and C = C [−1; 1] and R = R [−1; 1] - the spaces of all continuous and, accordingly integrated by Riman into [−1; 1] functions with conventional Max and SUPs. Theorem 1. For any function F ∈ R [−1; 1] polynomials (1) converge in space L2 (ρ); if f ∈ C [−1; 1], then the speed of convergence can be determined by the inequality ‖f - lnf‖l2 (ρ) ≤ 2 √ πen (f) c, n ∈ N, (2) where E (f) c is the best uniform approximation of the function F ∈ C [ −1; 1] Algebraic polynomials of the degree not higher than n. Theorem 2. Operators LN: C → L2 (ρ) are limited in aggregate, more precisely, ‖ln‖ → l2 (ρ) ≤ √ π, n ∈ N. (3) theorem 3. For any function F ∈ R [ −1; 1] lim n → ° 1∫ −1 ln (f; x) dx√ 1– x2 = 1∫ −1 f (x) dx√ 1– x2; (4) if f ∈ C [−1; 1], then for any n ∈ N, the assessment ∣∣∣∣∣∣ 1∫ −1 f (x) - ln (f; x) √ 1– x2 dx ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ 2πe2n - 1 (f) are true C. (5) 106 Condition. Gaussa -Chebyshev quadrature formula 1∫ −1 √ 1 - x2f (x) dx ≈ π n + 1 n∑ k = 1 sin2 kπ n + 1 f (cos kπ n + 1), f ∈ C, (6) is a private a case of formula 1∫ −1 f (x) dx√ 1– x2 ≈ 1∫ −1 ln (f; x) dx√ 1– x2 = π n n∑ k = 0 ′ f (xk), (7) where the bar is stroke The sign of the sum means that with k = 0 and k = n the corresponding terms should be divided into 2. Let πn - determined in the space L2 (√ 1– x2) Polynomial operator of the method of oscilling functions πn (f; x) = d dx ln              x∫ 0 f (t) dt  , f ∈ L2 (√ 1– x2), n ∈ N. (8) theorem 4. Operators πn: l2 (√ 1– x2) → ãl2 (√ 1– x2) strongly They converge, and for any n ∈ N, the assessment of 1 ≤ ‖πn‖l2 (√1 - x2) → l2 (√ - x2) <π 2, ‖f −πnf‖l2 (√1 - x2) ≤ π 2 en are true −1 (f) l2 (√ 1 - x2), where EN -1 (F) L2 (√ 1–x2) is the best approximation in space L2 (√ 1– x2) = L2 (√ 1– x2; [−1; ; 1]) the functions f ∈ L2 (√ 1– x2) with algebraic polynomials of the degree not higher than n - 1 (n ∈ N). In the third part of the report, the applications of many Gochlens (1), including theorem 1–4, to the solution of regular and singular integral equations by the methods of mechanical squares, collocation and oscillitive functions will be considered. 107
