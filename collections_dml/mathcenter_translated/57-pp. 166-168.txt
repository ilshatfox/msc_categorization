Let the operator T now act not only in the four spaces discussed above, but also in the space (not closed) n = {ronic j} φj = 1 ∈ L2 (22 J) | Φ∑ j = 1 ₽ j = 0}. Theorem. The operator t will introduce in the form of the sum of the scalar operator and operator B, displaying the sum of the spaces to the intersection. Literature 1. Davidson K. Nest Algebras.

Action of Bounded Operators in Some Spaces with Rarefied Weights M.V. Kabanko, E.L. Myagchenkova Prof. V.I. Ovchinnikov Suggested the Hypothesis on Connection of the “Number” of Interporation Spaces with the Structure of the Algebra of Operators in a Couple (Family) of Spaces. MORE PRECISILY, In MORE Spaces theRE ARE Operators and the MORE CONDITIONS ARE IMPOSED on the Action of Operators, The Simpler Is the Algebra of Oferators. That is, in fact, the reason for the difference in the Spaces Constructed by Different Interpolation Methods in Families of More Two Spaces of a Pair of Spaces. The Example, Constructed in the Paper, Confirms This Hypothesis to Some Extend. Keywords: Operator Algebras, Families of Hilbert Spaces, Representation of Operator Algebras.

Keywords: generalized module cited, Mityuk function, Mityuk radius, canonical region, conformal display. The classical task of the theory of functions is to build conformal display f (W, W0) = (W −W0) F (W, W0) (1) A.V. Kazantsev, M.I. Kinder 167 flat finish areas on canonical areas in the form of a circle with sections of fixed types: circular concentric arcs, radial cuts, combinations of both, etc. I.P. Mityuk [1] indicated the path of constructing the generalized given modules associated with the functions of the type (1). The generalized given module (mityuk function) D at point W relative to the canonical region ∆ = f (d) is defined as m∆ (w) = 1 2π lnω (W), (2) where ω (W) = 1/| f (w, w) | - Radius Mityuk [2]. The connection of the functions of the type (2) with external reverse edge tasks goes back to F.D. Gakhov [3]. It turned out that the presence in the function of m∆ (W) critical points equivalent to the resolving of the corresponding external task [4]. We denote through λ∆ the set of all critical points of the function Mear (W) in D; For convenience, the types of sections of regions ∆ will be denoted by lowercase Latin letters. Consider the property of A. Let D-flat (n+1) -It region, function (1) conformally displays D to the circle ∆ = f (d) with n cuts of a fixed type T. There is a natural number NT, depending only on T and such that if n ≥ NT, then many λ∆ are not empty. In the case when ∆ = ∆c is a single circle with circular concentric sections, property A is proved in [5] with NC = 1; The transition to the ring d = eQ = {w | q <| w | <1} In the work [2] it made it possible to advance in obtaining the substantive conditions of localization and the minimum of the number (= 2) of the elements λ∆c. For a single circle burdor = ∆c, r with circular concentric and radial cuts, property A is proved in the article [6]. In this case, NC, R = 2 and the border ∂D - analytical; In [7], the preservation of properties is announced in the transition to the Zhordan areas. In [6] it is also shown that if D = EQ and F (D) = ∆R is a single circle with a radial cut, then λ∆R = ∅. It is noted above that if n = 1, then λ∆c ̸ = ∅. It turns out that it is possible to build functions F1 and F2 of the type (1) such that the type of sections of areas F1 (EQ) = ∆̃C and F2 (EQ) = ∆̃R is preserved when the areas are transition from ∆C and ∆R, respectively, and the external components of the boundaries ∂∆̃C and ∂∆̃R are star -shaped curves of a special type, and λ∆̃c = ∅ and λ∆̃r ̸ = ∅. In this report, property A is investigated for canonical areas ∆ with various types of cuts under various conditions on the boundary components of their prototypes D. In the two -way case, a number of examples were considered. The work was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan as part of the scientific project No. 18-41-160017. Literature 1.
