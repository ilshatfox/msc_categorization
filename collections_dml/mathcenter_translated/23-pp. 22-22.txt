)  INCOMPUTABILITY FIFTY YEARS AFTER ALAN TURING  In the fifty years since Turing died (on the 7th June, 1954), his work on mathematics, logic and computer science has continued to exercise a unique influence. At the heart of his research was a lifelong concern with questions of computability, and in particular the need to find out more about the interface, both in the mathematics of the real world and in relation to the human mind, between computability and incomputability - the existence of unsolvable problems having been discovered, of course, by Turing and Alonzo Church in the 1930s. In this talk I will review the role of incomputability in Turings life and work, and examine its enduring impact on current research.  A. Facchini (Padova, Italy, facchini@math.unipd.it)  DIRECT SUM DECOMPOSITIONS OF MODULES, ALMOST TRACE IDEALS,  AND PULLBACKS OF MONOIDS  Suppose we want to study and describe all direct-sum decompositions of a fixed right module M over an associative ring S with identity. There is not a natural algebraic structure on the set of all direct-sum decompositions of M . The way to overcome this difficulty is to pass to consider direct-sum decompositions of Mn for all n â‰¥ 0. As the direct sum of a direct-sum decomposition of Mn and a direct-sum decomposition of Mm is a direct-sum  24
