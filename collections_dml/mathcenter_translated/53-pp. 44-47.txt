Polynomial projection methods of solving ordinary differential equations with a fractional derivative in the main part of the even α - a given material number, m - 1 <α <m, m ∈ N. Consider the task of the koshi ∗ (i) (a) = 0, i = 0, m - 1, (1) for the differential equation of the fractional order k accord (dαa + ng) (x) + m - 1∑ k = 0 pk (x ) ∗ (k) (x) = f (x), a <x 6 b, (2) where f (x), pk (x), k = 0, m - 1, - known functions on [a, b ], ∗ (x) - desired; (Dαa+ng) (x) is a fractional derivative of Yu.r. Agachev, A.V. Savin 45 (left -sided) functions ∗ (x) of the order α in the sense of Riman Lyuville (see, for example, [1]), it is determined by the formula (dαa+ng) (x) ≡ 1 γ (m - m - m - m - m - m - m - m - m - m - m - m - m - m - m - α) dm dxm x∫ a onic (t) dt (x - t) α --m+1 = 1 γ (m - α) dxm x∫ a С (t) dt (x - t) {α}, where m = [α] + 1, [α] and {α} is the whole and fractional parts of the number α, respectively. If the function mon (x) has a summarized about the production order m, satisfying the initial conditions, then (dαa+onic) (x) ≡ 1 γ (m - α) x∫ a onic (m) (t) (x - t) α α α α α α α −m+ 1 = (i {α} a+ onic (m)) (x), where (i {α} a+ g) (x) is a fractional integral (left -handed) order {α} of the function G (x) in the sense of Riemann -Luville. Therefore, if the solution of the problem (1), (2) is contained in the class m times differential functions, then we will have an equivalent task to Koshi (1) for the integro-reduced equation k accord (i {α} a+ onic) (m)) (m)) ( x)+ m - 1∑ k = 0 pk (x) onic (k) (x) = f (x), a <x 6 b. (3) Let φ = ° wm hux - the space of the functions ∗ (x) that have a derivative onic (x) ∈ ° Hβ and satisfying the heads (1), where 0 <β <1- {α}, A ° Hβ denotes the Helder class of functions that turn to zero at the left end. We also introduce the space F = ° H {α}+β. In these spaces, we introduce the norm as follows: ‖f‖f = ‖f‖ + h (f; {α} + β), f ∈ F, 46 yu.r. Agachev, A.V. Savina ‖ç‖φ = ‖ eng (m) ‖c +h (onic (m); β), onic ∈ φ, where h (g; δ) is the smallest constant gelder of the function g (x) ∈ Hδ. The known properties of the fractional-integrated operator I {α} a+ participating in the main part of the equation (3) allow the equivalence of the statement about the unambiguous resolution of the task (1), (2) with the operator K: φ → F with any right part of F of the approval of the bilateral continuous reversibility of the operator k of this task. The approximate solution of the problem (1), (2) we will search in the form of ement (x) = n∑ k = 1 ck (x - a) k+m - {α} ≡ n∑ k = 1 ck (x - a) k +2M --α - 1. (4) Unknown coefficients {ck} are determined according to the projection method determined by some operator PN design of space F to the subspecies HN ⊂ F of algebraic polynomas of the degree not higher than n. This means that wor (x) of the type (4) is determined as the exact solution of the equation kn scrat ≡ pnk accord, onic ∈ φn ⊂ φ. (5) If the functions are PK (x), k = 0, m - 1, f (x) ∈ Hλ ⋂ f, {α} + + β <λ 6 1, the task (1), (2) has the only solution for any right -hand part of F and operators PN: y → yn have the norm ‖pn‖ = o (ln n), n → °, then equation (5) also has a single solution for all N> n0 ∈ N, which converges an accurate solution Tasks (1), (2) in the metric of space φ. As a special case, this is the convergence of the method of the method of the Galerkin, collocation and the same (the last two by certain units). I. I. Aksanova, D. Z. Urazova 47 l and Tr. T U R A 1.

Urazova MBOU “Vysokogorskaya Secondary School No. 2”, ILSI050@mail.ru Periodic orbits in the dynamics of pieces of side disposures with the parameter of one-dimensional discrete dynamic systems are widely used in physics, technology, biology, ecology, sociology and others sciences. For example, when studying simple models of financial markets or constructing environmental and population models, dynamic systems are explored, data using continuous and piece-line diligents, in particular, symmetric and asymmetric ten-shaped display, set by a system of two linear functions with one or two parameters (see, e.g., [1-5]). Note that the study of the dynamics of such references reduced serious attention and these models have been studied quite well. The next step towards studying tent -shaped reflection is the study of the case when the functions in the system are nonlinear. We consider one of the private servants of this task, when the function depends on one parameter, which allows you to conduct a full study of the dynamics.
