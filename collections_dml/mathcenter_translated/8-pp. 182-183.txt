) The issues of uniqueness for a certain class of the Haara rows we are considering some of the issues of uniqueness for the rows of HAAR φ∑ n = 1 ANMA (X). The next terminolo giya is used. The set of a ∈ [0, 1] is called the M-Mnity for the Rows of Haar with a certain condition (A), if there is a number of haaras with condition (A), not all coefficients of which are zero, satisfying the condition (A) and converging to zero outside A. If the set of A is not a M-Mnity for the rows of Haar with condition (A), then many A will call the U-many for the rows of haaras with condition (A). As a condition (a), consider the condition sn (x) = o (n 1–α), (1) where sn (x) = n∑ n = 1 anti (x), o - “its” for each X, and 0 ≤ α <1. Let the non -empty perfect subset of the segment [0, 1]. We introduce a number of numerical characteristics of the set B. We build the function βb (∆), determined on all binary intervals ∆. We conclude that βb (∆) = 0 if and only when there are no points from B. let βb ([0, 1]) = 1. Next, we build the βb function according to the rank of binary interval ∆ (see [1 ]). Let the βB be defined in the binary interval ∆ rank n, determine the βb on non -exciting binary intervals ∆i (i = 1, 2), which constitute in the combination of engine. Namely, even if K is the number of intervals ∆I, inside of which there are points from B, then βb (∆i) = 1/kβb (∆), if inside ∆ is points from b and βb (∆i) = 0 otherwise . Definition. We call the index of point x ∈ B relative to the set B the number (or possibly two numbers) indb x = sup {α ≥ 0, βb (∆n) = o (∆n) α}, where ∆n is the sequence of nuclear intervals, Inside each of which is points from B, and the rank ∆n is equal to N and x ∈ ∆n. At the same time, two indices have those points X for which there are two similar sequences. We call the upper in 182 dex of the set B the number B = SUP X], and the Lower In dex of the set B is the number indb = Inf x∈B Indb X. At the same time, 0 ≤ Indb ≤ Indb ≤ 1. Formulate the main results. Theorem 1. If a is the M-Mnity for the rows of Haar with condition (1), then A contains the perfect subset B with INDB> α, then A is the M-Mnity for the Rows of Haar with condition (1). Theorem 2. If A does not contain perfect subsets B with INDB ≥ α, then A is the U-many for the rows of Haar with condition (1). In particular, if a is a complete set with Inda <α, then a is a U-many for the rows of Haar with condition (1). Theorem 3. For any 0 ≤ α ≤ β ≤ 1, there is a perfect set B with indb = β and indb = α. Theorems 2 and 3 show that there are committed many for the rows of Haar with condition (1), if 0 <α <1. thereby, theorem 2 of work is generalized [2], where the perfect Umnity is built under a stronger condition, namely, namely, namely, namely, namely subject to the limitations of the general member of the Haar series (in this case, SN (x) = O (log2 n)).
