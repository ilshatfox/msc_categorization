The masking method for cryptographic protocols on the platform of the switching operations in [1] showed how to use communades in cryptography with an open key. We will assume that definitions, designations and results from [1] are known. Detailed justifications describe further results can be found in [2]. We will show how to improve the protocol 1 from [1]. Instead of operating R from the theorem 2 [1], the RC operate isomorphic, but isomorphism depends on the secret parameter C. This masking parameter can be set under certain conditions so that the attacking enemy for its location is a final, but arbitrarily large time (or he will have to solve the system of equations (1)). Instead of algeb, another algebra A is taken ({ki}; {yi}), the structure of which depends on the family of secret parameters Ki, yi (1 6 i 6 m). Theorem. The crypto resistance of the protocol 1 of [1] for the opera RAD RC and algebra A ({ki}; {yi}) is determined by the difficulty of solving the following system of tropical equations: n⊕ j = 1 (ai, j ⊙ c⊙ki ⊙ x⊙kij ⊙ yi ) = bi, 1 6 i 6 m, (1) where x1 ,. . . , xn, k1. . . , km, y1 ,. . . , ym and c are unknown. In conventional designations, the system (1) looks like this: min 16J6N (AI, J + KIC + KIXJ + Yi) = Bi, 1 6 I 6 m. T. I. Gaysin 63 in the case of K = Z We have the following system of equations:    a1,1C K1xk11 Y1 + · · + A1, NCK1XK1N Y1 = B1; . . . . . . . . . . . . am, 1c kmxkm1 ym + · · + am, nkkmxkmn ym = bm. (2) Note that the systems of equations (1), (2) are generally non -linear. At the moment, we are unknown to the methods of solving systems of equations of this type, not reduced to complete interruption. It is expected that the protocol 1 in the case of the ring of numbers and the tropical half -ring has sufficient crypto resistance. L and T R A T R A 1. Gaynullinaa.r. and Tronin S.N.
