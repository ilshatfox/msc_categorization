) The regional task of the Riemann in case of degeneration of the symbol in the space of generalized functions on the segment of the actual axis with the main space of SM, n is the lines of the functions gment pper (t), 130 having non-integrated degree-logarithmic features at the ends of the contour [a, b]. We will understand the integrals in the sense of the final part according to Adamar (designating, F.P.). Topology in SM, N is introduced using the system of norms: ‖ eng (t) ‖r = max {‖ware (t) ‖lp (ρ1), ‖ç ′ (t) ‖lp (ρ2) ,. . . , ‖ Eng (ρ−1) (t) ‖lp (ρr)}, ρi (t - a) p (m+1) (b) p (n+i) (i = 1, 2, · · · · · r), ‖ware (t) ‖lp (ρ1) =   ∫ l ρ1 (t) | onic (t) | p dt   1/p, p> 1 analytical representation of the koshi generalized function F ∈ S ing, n f̂ (z) = f̂ (x ± ih) = 1 2πi (f (t), 1 t - (x ± ih)) is analytical in the plane Z everywhere with the exception of the segment [, b]. The statement is true: if f (t) ∈ S ing, n, onic (t) ∈ Sm, N exists, then there is lim h →+0 f̂ (x ± ih) = f̂ ± (x) and the ratio is performed: f̂+(f̂+( x) + f̂ - (x) = sf, f̂ + (x) - f̂ - (x) = f (x), f̂ ± (x) purpose of s’s, n, where (sf, gment) = (f, --S accord), sf = 1 πi F.P. b∫ a onic (τ) τ - t dτ. The resulting formulas of Sohotsky are used to solve the next task of linear conjugation with a degenerate symbol. Find the function F̂ (Z), the generalized limit values ​​of which satisfy the regional condition: ((t - α) n f̂ + (t) + (t - α) ng (t) f̂ - (t), ship (t)) = ( (t - α) ng (t), ∗ (t)) on the segment [, b] the actual axis; where n is the whole non -negative number, α ∈ (a, b), g (t) ∈ S ing, n, onic (t) ∈ Sm, n. 131 It is assumed that the coefficient of the task (t) ∈ C of [a, b] accepts the actual positive values ​​of and∆arg g (t) | [a, b] = 0. It is proved that the solution of the formulated problem has the form: f̂ (z ) = x (z) 2πi (g (t) x+(t), 1 t - z)+x (z) n - 1∑ k = 0 ak (α - z) k+1, where g (t) = x+(t)/x - (t), ak - arbitrary permanent. B. A. Katz (Kazan) The boundary values ​​of the integral of the Koshi on the self -like fractal curve let γ are a closed curve on a complex plane, and F (t) - a function set on it. If the curve γ is hidden, and f ∈ L (γ), then with Z 6] the function F (z) = 1 2πi ∫ γ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ dt t - z, (1) called the Cosa integral. In this paper, the integral (1) is studied in a situation where the γ curve is fractal and therefore unearthly. Despite this, the integral exists with certain restrictions on γ and f. Let φ (x) are continuous, monotonously increasing at x ≥ 0. The function is such that φ (0) = 0. The curve γ is called φ sprinkled if SUPζ ∑ J rune (| zj - zj - 1 | ger, where Supremum takes on all the final sequences of the points ζ = {z0, z2 ,. . . , zj,. . .} ⊂ γ, technology in the manner of bypass γ. Regarding the function f, we assume that it satisfies the condition of the Hölder with the indicator ν ∈ (0, 1]. It can be shown that the integral (1) exists as an integral of the style, provided that the row is ∑ motor n = 1 onic 1+ν (1/n ), where onic is a function inverse to φ. Further, the closed curve γ is called self -like if for each point t ∈ γ you can indicate its arc 132
