. Nosymmetric metric connectedness and their classification of I. A. Gordeev Vladimir State Pedagogical University, gordeeva@vgpu.vladimir.ru will consider the n-dimensional (pseudo) Rimanovo diversity m with metric tensor G and lordia of the Levi-Chivita ∇. The linear connectedness ∇ with non -equal to steam is called asymmetric metric coherence, if ∇g = 0. We denote through the s telawing of coherence ∇. Then the tensor s, such that s (z, x, y) = g (z, s (x, y)) for any x, y, z ∈ TM, at each point x ∈ M satisfies the condition sx ∈ T ∗ XM ⊗ λ2 (txm). Consider two operators λ3: t ∗ xm ⊗ λ2 (t ∗ xm) → λ3 (t ∗ xm) and (tr12W) (x) = ∑ k = 1, ..., n w (ek, ek, x) for arbitrary Wx ∈ T ∗ XM ⊗ λ2 (t ∗ XM) and orthonomated basis {E1 ,. . . , en} TXM spaces. Then the decomposition t ∗ xm ⊗ λ2 (txm) = gx ∧rt ∗ xm ⊕λ3 (t ∗ xm) ⊕ ker λ3 ∩ ker (TR12) is true, which is irreversible relative to the action of the ORTO Gonal Group O (GX). In accordance with this decay of 62, we will select seven classes as aimimal metric ligaments in an invariant way. At the same time, to one class of the DNE BU to attribute all the connectedness ∇ for which the SX tensor for all X ∈M belongs to the same invariant subspace from T ∗ XM ⊗ λ2 (T ∗ XM). We will assume ∇ ∈ C1 if sx ∈ Gx ∧ rt ∗ xm for all x ∈M. Then s (z, x, y) = (n - 1) −1 [g (z, x) (tr12s) (y) - g (z, y) (tr12s) (x)] for any x, y, y, y, Z ∈ TM. This class consists of semi -symmetric metric ligaments, which were introduced into consideration by K. Yano (see [1]) and continue to cause the interest of researchers until recently (see, for example, [2.3]). We will assume ∇ ∈ C2 if sx ∈ λ3 (txm) is for all x ∈M. This class of connectedness is characterized by the fact that the average connection of the mutual pair of connectedities (see [4], p. 129) coincides with the coherence of the Levi-Chivita, i.e. 2–1 (∇xy + ∇yx) = ∇xy for any X, y ∈ TM. It is also easy to prove that the connectedness ∇ ∈ C2 have common geodetic with the connectedness of the Levichivites ∇. Such connectedness was considered by K. Yano (see [5], p. 78–92) with the aim of expanding the area of ​​use of the “Bochner technique”, and it was proved that the connectedness of ∇ ∈ C2 naturally arise in the space of the semi -”of Lee (see there). The following classes of asymmetric metric sneakers were not investigated: 1) ∇ ∈ C3, which means sx ∈ Ker λ3 ∩ ker (tr12S) for all x ∈M; Then s (z, x, y) + s (x, y, z) + s (y, z, x) = 0 63 and (tr12s) (x) = ∑ k = 1, ..., n s ( ek, ek, x) = 0; 2) ∇ ∈ C1 ⊕ c3, which means sx ∈ Kerλ3 for all x ∈ M; Then s (z, x, y) + s (x, y, z) + s (y, z, x) = 0; 3) ∇ ∈ C1 ⊕ c2, which means sx ∈ Gx ∧ rt ∗ ⊕ λ3 (t ∗ xm) for all x ∈M; Then s (z, x, y) + s (x, z, y) = (n - 1) −1 (2g (z, x) (TR12S) (Y) - - G (X, Y) (TR12S ) (Z) - g (z, y) (TR12S) (x)); 4) ∇ ∈ C2 ⊕C3, which means sx ∈ Ker (tr12) for all x ∈M; Then (TR12S) (x) = ∑ k = 1, ..., n s (ek, ek, x) = 0.
