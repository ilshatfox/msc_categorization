) The very constructive maces of algebras are constructive (calculated) Model M is called very constructive if its full diagram (built of the first-order formulas) is calculated, and N-constructive if its σn diagram is calculated. The concept of 0-designity of the model is equivalent to its usual constructiveness. In other words, M is very constructive if there is an algorithm that, according to the first order formula and the set of elements from the model, determines whether this formula is true on this set. If T is the theory of the first order, then we introduce the designation CM (t) = Inf {n ∈ ω | Any N-constructive model M | = T has a very constructive isomorphic copy}. This message fully describes CM (t) for any T, which is an elementary theory of a certain class of Boolery algebra, i.e., for any T that expands the axioms of the Boolery algebra. The study was partially supported by the Russian fund of fundamental research (project No. 02-01-00593). V.A. Artamonov (Moscow, Artamon@mech.math.msu.su) about the symmetry of quasicristals in 1984. AL0.86MN0.14 was built with icosaedal symmetry, not allowed by the known classification of symmetry groups of crystals. New metal alloys with non -courting groups of symmetry are called quasicristals. Let's set out a certain approach to their description. Let the Hermitic space E, called the super space with a fixed orthonomated basis E = (E1, EN). We denote through m all vectors whose coordinates in the basis E are whole gowsk numbers. Suppose that the material physical subspace V is highlighted in E, E = C ⊗R V and IV ∩ M = 0. Consider E as a 2N-dimensional Euclidean space, where x ⊥ IX for all X SER V. Let p - a “single” cube in E, consisting of all vectors, having in the Base of E Coordinates of the type A + Ib, where 15
