) The characterization of the trace by the degree inequalities below through MN we denote the linear space of all n × nmotor above the field of complex numbers, through the MHN - the subset of the Ermi 45 of the 45th matrix, through M+N - the subset of M H N positively the semi -subject matrix. For X, Y ∈ MHN, the recording x ≤ y means that y −x ∈ M+n. For the matrix x ∈ MHN and the material function F, the determination area of ​​which contains the spectrum X, the value F (x) ∈ MHN is determined by the final version of the spectral theorem. In particular, for x ∈ M+N and any P> 1, the XP matrix is ​​correctly determined. For x, y ∈ MHN absolute meaning | XY | It is defined as (y x2y) 1/2. Through M ′+N, we denote many linear functionals on MN, taking non -negative values ​​on M+N. Theorem. For the functionality onic ∈ M ′ + n, the execution of each of the following conditions entails that wor is a scalar multiple of the trace: (i) for some numbers p, q> 1, 1 p + 1 q = 1, p 6 = 2, for any matrix X, Y ∈ M+N is performed “Helder's inequality” | onic (XY) | ≤ onic (xp) 1/p accord (y q) 1/q; (II) for some numbers p, q> 1, 1 p + 1 q = 1, for any matrix x, y ∈ M + n is the “Yunga inequality” ∗ (| XY |) ≤ 1 p ∗ (XP) + 1 q gment (y q); (III) for some P> 1 for any such matrices x, y ∈ M+N, that x ≤ y is “inequality of monotony” ising ≤ ∗ (y p). As you know, for the trace, the above inequalities occur and, thus, each of the conditions (I), (II), (III) characterizes the trace. Consequence. The functionality onic ∈ M ′+n is a scalar multiple of the trace and only when wor (ex) ≤ onic (ey) for any such x, y ∈ MHN, which x ≤ y. We also note that the above results allow generalization in case of functionals and weights on C*- and W*algebrah.
