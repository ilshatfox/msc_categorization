The uniqueness of the solution of the regional problem with a non -valid limited condition LOZ is indeed1 · Olyuy region n = {(x, t): o <x <l, o <t <t} Consider the equation UTT - 1tx; 1, · = 0 (1) and We will study for him the task with the initial condition UT (x, o) = 1/1 (x), (2) non -valued condition t and (x, o)+ fo and (.t, t) dt = l1 (x) (3) (3 ) and boundary conditions}! Mi and (o, t) = o, u (l, t) = about. (4) By the classic solution to the problem (1)-(4) we mean the function u (x, t) e 1 (p} ns2 (n), which satisfies in the area of ​​the urtshevit (1) and conditions (2)-(4 ). Suppose that there are two solutions to the problem in question (1) - (4) u1 (x, t) and H2 (x, t), and consider the difference 11 (x, t) = and ~ (x, t) - I2 (x, t). (5) Function 11 (x, t) satisfies the homogeneous equation (G) 104 Fr. Kechin and homogeneous conditions VT (X, O) = O, (7) T 11 (x, 0) + fo 1j (x, t) dt = o, (8) v (o, t) = o. 11 (l, t) = o. We prove that functions1 v (: j :, · t) go to the zain. Multiply. Multiply Equation (6) on L'T and we will intervene 110 areas PT = (O, L) x (O, T), T [o, t] NOLLECTION OF: T L T L J J 1.JTT (X, T) VT (: J:, t) dxdt - j 11,: t (x, t) u1 (x, t) llxdt = o. (10) o () o () after elementary transformations and the use of conlorics (7), (8) and (9), we get rowing l l (t) 2 j (v ~ (x, t) + v; (x, t)) dx = j 1jx (x, i) llt <lx, o o (11 ) from which the inequality flows in l l t j (vl (x, t) + v; (x, t)) dx ~ t j · and; (x, t) clxdt. (12) () about the further assessment and application of the inequality of Gronuoll lead to an approval of the uniqueness of the decision of the NRI to the statue small T.
