Materials of the International School-Conference UDC 517.956 Task Darbu for the equation of Bianchi of the third order A.N. Mironov1 1 miro73@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, the Elabuga Institute proven the existence and unity of the solution of the problem of Darbu. A solution to Darbu’s problem in terms of a function similar to the function of Riemann-Adamar was built. Keywords: Bianchi equation, Darbu's task, Riman-Adamar's function. The task of Darbu for a second -order hyperbolic equation with two independent variables was considered by many authors. You can specify the work [1, p. 228–233], [2] - [7]. Here, the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the problem of Darbu, as well as the question of building the corresponding function of Riemann-adamar for the equation of the third order Biang Ux Y Z+ 1∑ I = 0 1∑ K = 0 1∑ K = 0 i+ K <3 AI J K K K K. (x, y, z) uxi y j zk = f (x, y, z), (1) which is considered, for example, in work [8] - [13]. At the same time, in [9], [11], the setting of tasks such as Darbu for some particular cases of the Bianchi equation is considered. We determine the class of functions C (K, L, M) as follows: The function U ∈ C (K1, K2, K3), if there are continuous derivatives ∂ R1+R2+R3U ∂XR1∂YR2∂ZR3 (Ri = 0,... , ki). Class C (1.1.1) will be called regular. Let D is the area limited by the planes x = 0, y = 0, y = y0> 0, z = x, z = z0> 0. We believe that the coefficients of equation (1) satisfy the smooth conditions of ai j k ∈C (i, j , k) (D). We denote through x, y, t the face D at x = 0, y = 0, z = x, respectively. Darbu's task. In the region D, find the regular solution of the equation (1) that satisfies the boundary conditions u | x = onic (y, z), u | y = ng (x, z), u | t = ψ (x, y), ng1 ( y, 0) = ψ (0, y), ∗2 (x, x) = ψ (x, 0), ng (0, z) = ∗2 (0, z), ϕ1 ∈C (1.1) (x ), ∗2 ∈C (1.1) (y), ψ ∈C (1.1) (t). (2) using the well -known formula for solving the Gurs problem for the Bianchi equation [12, p. 28] as a presentation of an arbitrary regular solution of the equation (1), an integral equation of the volterra of the second kind was obtained to determine the condition of the Gurs u (x, y, z0), from the existence and uniqueness of the solution of which the existence and unity of the solution of the problem of the Darbu problem (1) - (2 ). Gurs's task. Find in the parallelepiped g = {x1 <x2, y1 <y <y2, z1 <z <z2} Regular solution of equation (1) that satisfies the conditions u | x = ng (y, z), u | y = ∗2 ( x, z), u | z = ∗3 (x, y), ∗1 (y, z1) = onic (x1, y), ∗2 (x, z1) = ∗3 (x, y1), ∗1 (x1, z) = ∗2 (x1, z), ϕ1 ∈C (1.1) (x1), onic (1.1) (y1), onic (1.1) (z1). A.N. Mironov 261 here X1, Y1, Z1 - the gorg at x = x1, y = y1, z = z1. The solution of the problem of Gurs exists and only [12, p. 25–26]. Briefly describe the construction of the formula for solving the problem of Gurs [8], [12, p. 28]. Races we look at the integral equation V (x, y, z) - ˆ z ζ a110 (x, y, γ) v (x, y, γ) dγ - - ˆ x ₽ a011 (α, y, z) v (α, y, z) dα - ˆ y η a101 (x, β, z) v (x, β, z) dβ + + ˆ y η z ζ a100 (x, β, γ) v (x, β, γ) dγdβ+ ˆ x ₽ ζ ζ a010 (α, y, γ) v (α, y, γ) dγdα+ ˆ x ă y η a001 (α, β, z) v (α, β, z) dβdα dβdα - - ˆ x ă ˆ η η ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ β) v (α, β, γ) dγdβdα = 1. (3) Solution V this equation exists and only, this solution is called the Riemann function (1 ) [8], [9]. Obviously, V depends on ă, η, ζ. If you need to emphasize this dependence, write v = r (x, y, z, hole, η, ζ). Direct calculation can be verified in the justice of the identity (UR) x y z ≡ rl (u) + ([rz —a110r] u) x y + ([rx –A0111r] u) y z + + + ([ry –A101R] u) xz - ([[ Ry z - (a110r) y - (a101R) z +a100r] u) x - - ([rxz - (a110r) x - (a011r) z +a010r] u) y - ([rx y - (a011r) y - (A101R) x +A001R] U) Z, (4) where AI J K depends on (x, y, z), r = r (x, y, z, hole, η, ζ) - Riman function, and u (u (u ( x, y, z) - any function from C (1.1.1). Enter the designations A100 = RX —A011R, A010 = RY --A101R, A001 = RZ –A110R, A110 = RX Y - (A011RR) Y - (A101R) X +A001R, A101 = RXZ - (A110R) X - (A011RR) +A010R, A011 = RY Z - (A110R) Y - (A101R) Z +A100R. By differentiation of equation (3), it is easy to verify the justice of identity A100 ≡ 0 with y = η, z = ζ; A010 ≡ 0 with x = cil, z = ζ; A001 ≡ 0 for x = cil, y = η; A110 ≡ 0 with z = ζ; A101 ≡ 0 with y = η; A011 ≡ 0 with x = cil. (5) Considering in identity (4) the function u (x, y, z) by solving the equation (1), changing variables (x, hole), (y, η), (z, ζ) roles and then calculating the triple integral cil, η, ζ within the x1 <hole <x, y1 <η <y, z1 <ζ <z taking into account (5), we get u (x, y, z) = r (x, y, z1) ∗3 ( x, y)+r (x, y1, z) ∗2 (x, z)+262 Materials of the International School-Conference+R (X1, Y, Z) ng (Y, Z) −R (X, Y1, Z1) ∗3 (x, y1) - - --r (x1, y, z1) ∗3 (x1, y) −r (x1, y1, z) ∗2 (x1, z)+r (x1, y1, z1) ng (y1, z1) + + ˆ x x1 [a100 (α, y1, z1) ∗3 (α, y1) - a100 (α, y, z1) ∗3 (α, y) - a100 (α, y1, z) ∗2 (α, z)] dα + + y y1 [a010 (x1, β, y1) onic (x1, β) - a010 (x, β, z1) ∗3 (x, β) - a010 (x1, β, z) ∗1 ( β, z)] dβ + + ˆ z1 [a001 (x1, y1, γ) onic (y1, γ) - a001 (x, y1, γ) ∗2 (x, γ) - a001 (x1, y, γ) wor (y, γ) dγ++ ˆ x1 ˆ y y1 a110 (α, β, z1) ∗3 (α, β) dβdα+ ˆ x1 ˆ z1 a101 (α, y0, γ) ϕ2 (α, γ) dγdα + + y y1 ˆ z z1 a011 (x1, β, γ) ∗1 (β, γ) dγdβ + (6) + ˆ x1 ˆ y1 ˆ z1 r (α, β, γ) f ( α, β, γ) dγdβdα.
