) A comparison of monotonous solutions of differential equations with delayed the equation U '(x) =! A 00 U "(x - s) DR (x, s) (A ~ x <b) (1) with the initial function R.P (t), and Equation Z '(x) = 100 z "(x - s) DR1 (x, s) (A ~ x <b) (2) with the beginning of the main function f (t), a> O. The initial functions of R.P (t ) and 'tf; (t) are continuous on (-o,}, nuclei r (x, s) and r 1 (x, s) do not decrease according to S for each fixed x e [a, b) and ensure existence and ensure Unity of decisions on [a, b). Integration is carried out according to S, integral is understood in the sense of St.'Ties. Next, the designations from [1], 'Fu = Inf' f (x) are used. (-OO, a] for monotonous solutions of equations (1) and (2) the following comparison theorem. 150 theorem 1) ECJL, IR (X, S) S is true; R1 (x, s), r 1 (x, +oo)> o (s; x <s, o s < +oo), 1f!
