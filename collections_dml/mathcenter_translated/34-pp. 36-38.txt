Resolving the problem of the drum by M. G. Volynskaya Samara University, Volyn79@mail.ru The study of the oscillations of the drum membrane leads to mathematical modeling to the next task for a loaded hyperbolic equation: UTT = URR + 1 R Ur - α2 R0∫ 0 RU (R. T) DR, R S (0, R0], T ∈ [0, T]; (1) U (R0, T) = 0, (2) U (R, 0) = PO (R), (3 ) Ut (r, 0) = ψ (r), (4) | u (0, t) | <mm, (5) where α is constant. 38 temporarily counting the function f (t) = −α2 r0∫ 0 ru (r, t) DR is known, the solution of the task can be obtained by Fourier. It is shown that the method of separating variables leads to the task of the assault -liuville for the equation of the BESSEL, which are the functions of the BESSEL J0 (µkr R0). Using the Shafheitlin theorem ( [3], p. 540) On the properties of the roots of µK the functions of Bessel J0 (X), as well as the conditions for the convergence of some rows of Fourier -Bessel ([1], p. 295), it was possible to show that the function F (t) satisfies the Voltaire equation second kind f (t) - t∫ 0 2R30F (τ) و n = 1 1 µ3n sin µn (t - τ) r0 dτ = g (r, t), (6) where G (r, t) is expressed through known functions. Due to the equalities of the row our °∑ n = 1 µ3n sin µn (t - τ) R0, the kernel core (6) is continuous and limited, which entails the existence of the only solution to this integral equation ([2], p. 228 ). Thus, the task (1) - (5) becomes a classic laughing task. Proof of the uniqueness of the solution of the problem (1) - (5) is based on the received a priori assessment R0∫ 0 r (u2t (r, t) + u 2 r (r, t)) DR 6 0. 39 l and t e r and t. U R A 1. Tolstov A.N.

Vyalov Kaliningrad State Technical University, olga_omelyan2002@mail.ru in the n-dimensional projective space PN PN-plate bone surface SH+R seems to be a degenerate multipline of three A, lh, tm), and point a, (a ∈ LH ⊂ tm) and the tangent plane TM (m = h+r) describe the M-seniority, and the forming LH is the R-dimensional family [1]. With the top of SH+R, the main stratification G (SH+R) is associated, the base of which is the surface itself, and the typical layer is under the group of hospital stationaries. The point-excavated surface can be represented by the stratification of LH (BR) with the base-the grace of the BR forming LH, considered as elements of the variety of the grassman GR (h, n), and the typical layer-the family point of the plane of the LH plane. Therefore, the variety of points of the fixed generator LH ⊂ SH+R is the narrowed base of the stratification G (SH+R). Group connectedness in the main stratification G (SH+R) is set using the field of connectedness γ [1]. About the composite equipment [1] of the point -excavation surface is picked up, which consists in the connection of the surface of the three planes of the three planes PH -1, PM - H - 1, PN - M - 1, about the drawing of 40, respectively, 40
