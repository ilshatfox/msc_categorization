Nasibullin1 1 nasibullinramil@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University proven new inequalities, including fractional integrals and its derivative. Previously, we get the lower estimates of weight norms of the derivative through expressions, depending on the fractional integrals of Riman-Liwill. Keywords: Hardy inequality, fractional integral of Riman-Liwill, Bessel's function. 266 Materials of the International School-Conference Let ρ> 0 and the absolutely continuous function u: [0, ρ] → R satisfies the boundary condition U (0) = 0 and U ̸≡ 0. In the article [1] F.G. Avhadiev and R.G. Nasibullin showed that for such functions U under conditions R ∈ [1, least), S ∈ (− least, R) and U ′/T R -1 ∈ L1 (0.1) The inequality ρˆ 0 (t) | t s d t <m (s, r) ρr - s ρˆ 0 | u ′ (t) | T R -1 d T, (1) where m (s, r): =   (1– S) −1, if r = 1; (R −1) −1 E-1, if S = 1; (r - s) −1 ((r −1)/(r - s)) (r - 1)/(1–S), if r ̸ = 1, s ̸ = 1. Constant M (s, r) It is accurate for all permissible S and R, i.e., it cannot be reduced without additional restrictions on the function U. Using the inequality of Helder, from the inequality (1) for S <1 and P ≥ 1, it is easy to obtain its LP analogue, namely, the next ratio ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ ρ (t) | p t s d t ≤ ρp (1–S) (P 1- s) p ρˆ 0 | u ′ (t) | p t s (1 --p) d t. (2) the constant in inequality (2) is unreasonable only with p = 1 (see more [1]). This is easy to notice if you compare (2) with accurate inequality from the article [2]. Note that the constant in the LP analysis of inequality (2) at S = 1 is also not optimal due to the exact inequality 1ˆ 0 | u (t) | 2 t d t ≤ 4 j 20 1ˆ 0 | u ′ (t) | 2D T, (3) in which equality is achieved on the function u (t) = C ′ p t j1 (J0 p t), and J0 ≈ 2.404826 is the smallest positive root of the zero -order bastard, J1 is the function of the first -order BESSEL. Recall that the functions of the Bessel of the Order ν are determined as follows by Jν (t) = φ∑ k = 0 (−1) k t 2k+ν 22k+νK! Γ (k+1+ν), t> 0, ν≥ 0. Here. And then, through γ, the gamma function of Euler is indicated, i.e. Γ (α) = و 0 tα-1e --t d t. In this work, we generalize and get LP analogues of inequality (1). The following theorems are fair. Theorem 1. Let ρ> 0, s ∈ [0, α), α ∈ (0.1] and p> 1. Then for any absolutely continuous function f: [0, ρ] → R, such that f (0) = 0 and f ′ (x)/x s (1 --p) p ∈ LP (0, ρ), the inequality is performed ρˆ 0 d x Xs 0 | f (t) | p - 1 | f ′ (t) | (x - t) 1 --α d t ≤ ρ (p - 1) (1–s) −α+s p (1– s) p - 1 (α - s) ρˆ 0 | f ′ (x) | p xs (1- p) D X. R.G. Nasibullin 267 Theorem 2. Let ρ> 0, α ∈ (0.1], S <1 and P> 1. Then for any absolutely continuous function f: [0, ρ] → R, such that f (0) = 0 and f ′ ∈ L2 (0, ρ) is fairly the following inequality ρ ρ ρ ρ 0 d x α xˆ 0 || F ′ (t) | (x - t) 1–α d T t ≤ (1 α —h (α) ρ1 - S 2 (1– S) ρˆ 0 | F ′ (x) | 2 x --S D X + 2 J 20 ρ ′ (x) | 2D x, where harmonious Number h (α) = 1ˆ 0 1 - tα 1 - t d t. The investigation is 1. Let ρ> 0. Then for absolutely continuous function f: [0, ρ] → R, such that f (0) = 0 and f ′ ∈ L2 (0, ρ), the following accurate inequality ρˆ 0 | f ′ (t) | log ρ t d t ≤ 2 j 20 ′ (t) (t) (t) | 2D T. Investigation 2. The smallest own of owners the number of the next boundary task U ′ ′ (t) = −1 t U (t), u (0) = 0 is the number λ0 = j 20 4 and the own function of its own function U0 (t) = 2 j0 c1 p x j1 ( j0 p x). We introduce the following designations: ms, r, α = max 0≤t≤1 {t r --s (b1 (s q α, α) −bt/ρ (s −α, α))}, where BZ (s α, α) = zˆ 0 τs -α-1 (1–τ) α-11dτ, and through (iα0+onic) (x) we denote the fractional integral of the riman-luville function pper l1 (0, ρ), which is determined as (iα0 +∗) (x) = 1 γ (α) ˆ x 0 onic (x - t) 1–αd t, x> 0, where 0 <α <1. Note that complete information about the properties of fractional integrals can Find in [3], and examples of inequalities like Hardy with fractional integrals are given in [3], [4]. 268 Materials of the International School-Conference of Theorem 3. Let ρ> 0, R> S and α ∈ (0.1]. Then, for any function onic ∈ L1 (0, ρ), the following inequality ρ ρ 0 ∣∣ (iα0+onic) was performed (x) ∣∣ xs d x ≤ m (s, r, α) γ (α) ρr - s ρ ρ 0 | onic (x) | XR -α D X, where m (s, r, α) =   (α - s) −1, if r = α, 0 ≤ s <α; max xicle [0, ρ] {1/α --h (α)+ log/x}, if r> α, s = α; ms, r, α, if r> s> α, and γ is the gamma of the Euler function. Note that with α = 1 theorem 1 gives as a result of inequality (2) with a smaller constant one, the theorem 2 - inequality (3 ) and from theorem 3 as a result, we will receive inequality (1). The work was performed with the financial support of the RFFI (project 17-01-00282) and at the expense of the subsidy allocated to the Kazan Federal University to fulfill the state
