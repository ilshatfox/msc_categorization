UDC 517.98 On the convergence of discrete amounts of Fourier for polynomials, orthogonal on arbitrary nets A.A. Nurmagomedov1, I.A. Nurmagomedov2 1 alimn@mail.ru; Dagestan State Agrarian University named after MM. Dzhambulatova 2 nurmagomedov-02@mail.ru; MBOU No. 37 in this work for arbitrary continuous on the segment [−1,1] functions f (x) discrete amounts of Fourier SN, N (F, X) according to the polynomial system {p̂k, n (x)} n -1 k = k = k = k = k = 0, forming an orthonomated system on uneven systems of points consisting of a final number n points of the segment [−1,1] with a weight ∆t j = t j+1 - t j. The approximative properties of the constructed private sums SN, N (F, X) of the order n ≤ n −1 are investigated. In particular, an assessment of the deviation of the private amount SN, N (F, X) from F (X) is obtained by n = O (Δ–2/7N), which depends on N and the position of point x ∈ [−1,1]. Keywords: polynomial, orthogonal system, mesh, weight, asymptotic formula, discrete amounts of Fourier, the function of the Lebag. Let ω = {t j} nj = 0 - a discrete set (mesh), consisting of the final number of various points of the segment [−1,1]: −1 = t0 <t1 <. . . <tn -1 <tn = 1. Consider also another grid ωn = {x0, x1, ..., xn -1}, consisting of n points x j, where x j = (t j + t j + 1)/2, j = 0.1, ..., n −1. Through p̂k, n (x) = p̂k (x; ωn) (k = 0.1,., N −1), we denote the sequence of polynomials that form an orthonomated system on a mesh ωn in the following sense (0 ≤ n, m ≤ N −1): (p̂n, n, p̂m, n) = n - 1 j = 0 p̂n, n (x j) p̂m, n (x j) ∆t j = δnm, A.A.

Markova for evaluating derivatives of algebraic polynomials in the metric of space L1 [−1,1]: 1∫ −1 | q ′ ′ n (x) | D x ≤ 2n4 1∫ −1 | qn (x) | d x, p̂n (x) - orthonormated polynomial lyindra, c [−1, 1] - the space of continuous on the segment [−1,1] functions f (x) with the norm ∥ f ∥ = max - 1≤x≤1 | f (x) |, pn - the space of algebraic polynomials of the degree not higher than n, en (f) - the best approximation of the function F of algebraic polynomials no higher than n. Further, through SN, N (F) = SN, N (F, X), we denote the private amount of the N -’Fourier of the Fourier Fourier F (X) according to the system {p̂k, n (x)} n -1 k = 0, t . Sn, n (f) = n∑ k = 0 f̂k p̂k, n (x), where f̂k = ∑n - 1 j = 0 f (x j) p̂k, n (x j) ∆t j. As you know, the task of assessing the deviation of the private amount SN, N (F) Fourier of the functions f ∈ C [−1,1] according to the system {p̂k, n (x)} n - 1k = 0 from the function F with x ∈ [ −1, 1] through the inequality of the Lebeg: | f (x) −sn, n (f, x) | ≤ (1+ln, n (x)) EN (F) reduces to assessment of the function of the Lebeg LN, N (X) = N -1∑ J = 0 ∣∣ KN, N (X, X J) ∣∣∆T J, where KN, N (X, X J) = ∑N K = 0 P̂K, N (X) P̂K, N (X J). Hereinafter, through C, C (A, B), positive constant, depending only on these parameters and, generally speaking, are different in different places. In applied tasks related to the processing, compression and transmission of discrete information, the issues of approaching functions specified on discrete points of points are often solved using the rows of Fourier according to the corresponding system of polynomials orthonormated on these nets. In turn, as you know, the solution to this issue boils down to assessing the function of the Lebeg of private amounts of Fourier for these polynomials - they allow us to establish sufficient conditions for the uniform convergence of the Fourier ranks over the entire interval of orthogonality. And here it should be noted that these issues were the subject of the study in the works of many authors, among which we will indicate only some of them that are devoted to the study of the functions of the quota amounts, the convergence of the Fouri-Yakobi ranks and their discrete analogues. Earlier, the following statements were proved in [10]. 256 Materials of the School-Conference of Theorem 1. Let F ∈C [−1,1], 0 <b <1, 0 <a ≤ (1–b 22) 1 4, N = O (Δ−2/7N) . Then the inequality is fair (−1 ≤ x ≤ 1) ln, n (x) ≤ c (a, b) [ln (n +1)+| p̂n, n (x) |+| p̂n+1, n (x) | ]. Theorem 2. Let F ∈C [−1,1], 0 <b <1.0 <a ≤ {1–b 22} 1/4, n = O (δ−2/7n). Then it is a number relative to −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 fair estimate LN, N (X) ≤ C (A, B) (LN (N +1) +N 1 2 (N P 1 --x2) 12 +1). In particular, we note that the assessment of the module of the difference in this paper | f (x) —sn, n (f, x) | also
