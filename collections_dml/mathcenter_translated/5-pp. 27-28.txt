Consider the equation 82 and 2 82 and 8i L (and) = 8x2 +at WU2 +kUDU-si = o (O <k <1, s> o). (1) When solving regional problems for the equation (1), the construction of its fundamental solutions is significant. One of them with a feature at the point of the MO (Ho, UO) has the form: 1 ~ 1-K W (X, Y; Ho, UO) = 2 7RY0 2 U-2-CO (LR), (2) 11-I- \ 2 where L2 = C + ~ 'K 0 (T) is the function of the MacDonald, R 2 = (X x0) 2 + LN 2 JL. It is known that KO (t) with t -+ oo exponentially wales. Therefore, the fundamental decision (2) satisfies the following conditions: Lim W = O, Jim W = O. R-100 U-10 ']. 8W 0 1m- =.
