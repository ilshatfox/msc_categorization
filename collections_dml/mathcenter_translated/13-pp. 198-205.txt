. A numerical method for solving the problem of diffraction of an electromagnetic wave on an inclined metal plate in a flat wave of I.N. Polshchinsky Kazan State University considers the task of diffraction of its own TE waves of flat waves with metal walls on an inclined partition with a metal plate. A variable scheme has been built and investigated, on the basis of which numerical calculations have been made. Let Z = HX/G, 0 <x <g, - the inclined boundary of the section of the media with dielectric permeations ε1 and ε2 to the left and right in the flat waves with metal walls Z = 0 and Z = H in the Cartesian coordinate system. On the section of the media section is the perfectly conducting endlessly thin metal partition Z = HX/G, oring <x <nut2. Consider the scalar (∂/∂y = 0) The task of diffraction on the partition of the TE-Polarized electromagnetic wave that comes on the left. We denote θ angle of the boundary of the section of the media, tg θ = g/h. Let U0 (x, z) - the potential function of the original wave, u (x, z) 198 I.N. Pleshchinsky - the potential function of the desired field. In each of the media, potential functions satisfy the Helmholtz equation ∂2u ∂x2 + ∂2u ∂z2 + k2 (x, z) u = 0, (1) where at 0 <z <h k2 (x, z) = {k20ε1, x <z tg θ; K 2 0ε2, x> z tg θ}, k20 = ω 2ε0µ0µ, ω - circular frequency (the dependence of the lump of the field of the field on the time of EXP (Iωt)), ε0, µ0 - electrical and magnetic constant, µ = 1 - magnetic permeability of the media . On the walls of the waveguide u (x, 0 + 0) = 0, u (x, h - 0) = 0, x ∈ (− least, + urb). (2) We denote h = π/h, ∗ (t) = sinmht, γj, m = √ k20εj - (mh) 2 =   √ √ k20εj - (mh) 2, k20εj - (mh) 2 ≥ 0, −i √ (mh) 2 - k20εj, k20εj - (mh) 2 <0, kj (t, z) = 2 h mm∑ m = 1 1 γj, m wor (t) wor (z). As shown in [1], the solutions of the Helmholtz equation in the half -year, satisfying the conditions (2) and leaving from the segment X = 0 to the left and from the segment X = G to the right, satisfy the non -cabinal boundary conditions U (0–0, z) = −i h∫ 0 ∂u ∂x (0 - 0, t) k1 (t, z) dt, 0 <z <h, u (g + 0, z) = i h∫ 0 ∂u ∂x (g + 0, t) k2 (t, z) dt, 0 <z <h. The 199th Local Method of Solving the Dipage problem. . . Consider a rectangle [0, g] × [0, h]. From the conditions of the fields of fields at x = 0 and x = g = g that u (0 + 0, z) = −i h∫ 0 ∂u ∂x (0 + 0, t) k1 (t, z) dt + 2u 0 (0 - 0, z), (3) u (g - 0, z) = i h∫ 0 ∂u ∂x (g - 0, t) k2 (t, z) dt, 0 <z <h. (4) We denote m = (ă1, ₽), n = (0, ă) ∪ (ă2, g). On the border of the section of the medium outside the partition, conditions U (x+ 0, hx/g) = u (x - 0, hx/g), x ∈ N, ∂u ∂n (x+ 0, hx/g) = ∂u ∂ must be met. n (x - 0, hx/g), x ∈ N, (5) and ∂/∂n = ∂/∂x sin θ - ∂/∂z cos θ, and on the partition u (x+ 0, hx/g) = 0, u (x - 0, hx/g) = 0, x ∈M. (6) Theorem 1. The two-dimensional task of diffraction of the TE waves on the inclined partition in the flat waveguard is equivalent to the edge task for the Helmholtz equation (1) with a piece-to-stand coefficient in a rectangle, with conjugation conditions (5), (6) on the section of the media and the media section and boundary conditions (2), (3), (4). In the rectangle [0, g] × [0, h], set the mesh with nodes at points (xj, zk), j, k = 0, n, and xj = jhx = jg/n, zk = khz = kh/n. Denote uj, k = u (xj, zk), k 2 (j, k) = k2 (xj, zk), uction (k) = ∗ (zk). Let cil1 = xn1, cil2 = xn2. The task is reduced to the system of linear algebraic equations (SLAU), consisting of (n + 1) 2 equations: uj + 1, k + uj - 1, k h2x + uj, k + 1 + uj, k - 1 h2z + (k2 (k2 (k2 , k) - 2 h2x - 2 h2z) uj, k = 0, j, k = 1, n - 1, j 6 = k, (7) 200 I.N.

We build the theoretical justification of the algorithm using an abstract close circuit [2]. The decision of the Slau (7) - (12) denote u (n) and we will call it an approximating solution. We prove that with N → ° the sequence of solutions U (N) converges to the exact solution U. We build a linear operator A: U 7 → (A1U, A2U, A3U, A4U, A5U, A6U, A7U, A8U, A9U), where A1U = ∂2U ∂x2 + ∂2u ∂z2 + K2 (x, z) u, a2u = u (x, 0 + 0), a3u = u (x, h - 0), 0 ≤ x ≤ g, a4u = u (0 + 0, z) + i h∫ 0 ∂u ∂x (0 + 0, t) k1 (t, z) dt, 0 <h <h, a5u = u (g - 0, z) - i h∫ 0 ∂u ∂x (g - 0, t) k2 (t, z) dt, 0 <z <h, 201 numerical method for solving the problem of diffraction. . .

Operator A acts from the linear space U = C ([[[ 0, g] × [0, h]) in the space v = c ([0, g] × [0, h]) × c2 ([0, g]) × c2 ([0, h] × c2 ( M) × c2 (n). The exact operator equation has the form AU = V, where V = (0, 0, 0, 2U0 (0 + 0, Z), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). We set the operators of the approximation Tu: U → U, TV: V → V.
