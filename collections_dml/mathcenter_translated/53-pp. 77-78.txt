The unity of solving the problem of the type of keldysh with the integral condition of the second kind for the B-hyperbolic equation we will consider in the field d = {(x, t) | 0 <x <t <t} Hyperbolic equation with the constituent operator �bu (x, t ) ≡ utt - x --k ∂ ∂x (xk ∂u ∂x) = 0, (1) where k> 1, l, t> 0 - specified values, γl = {(x, t) | x = = L, 0 6 T 6 T} - part of the boundary of the region. For the equation (1) in the field D, the following initial task with a non -ockal boundary condition of the second kind was investigated. Find the function u (x, t) that meets the conditions: u (x, t) ∈ C (D) ∩ c1 (d γ γl) ∩ c2 (D), (2) �BU (x, t) ≡ 0, ( x, t) ∈ D, (3) u (x, 0) = onic (x), ut (x, 0) = ψ (x), 0 6 x 6 l, (4) ux (l, t) + l∫ 0 u (x, t) xk dx = 0, 0 6 T 6 T. (5) due to the results of work [1], [2, c. 246] In the class of limited in the field of D solutions of equation (1) at K> 1 segment x = 0 78 D. R. Kadyrov, A.I. Kukushkina, a. D. Pechenkina, A.A. Rakhimov of the border of the region D is freed from the boundary condition. In this case, it is shown [3, p. 68] that the equality of UX (0, T) = 0, 0 6 T 6 T. The method of integral identity has been proven. If there is a solution to the problem (2) - (5), then it is the only one. L and T R A T R A 1. Keldysh M.V.
