Two classes of Einstein’s equations V.N. Shelepova Vladimir Pedagogical University, Vera@vgpu.vladimir.ru in the general theory of relativity space-time before puts a smooth four-dimensional diversity m, equipped with a metric of the Lorentz signature (-+++). In the area of ​​the local coordinate system {x0, x1, x2, x3} metric G is set by its components Gij = G (∂i, ∂J), where ∂i = ∂/∂x i. With their help, in turn, the symbols of Christoffel γKij = 2 −1gkl ( K of covariant differentiation. Ricci's tensor R space-time is from identity R (∂i, ∂j) = rij = r k ikj, where rlikj are the components of the curvature of the curvature of the spaceship-ranges, determined from the equalities of Rklijx l = ∇i∇jxk-∇j∇ IXK. In the general theory of relativity of Lorentsev, the metric Gin is terrified as gravitational potential and is connected by Einstein’s equations R - 2–1S · G = T 219 with the distribution of energy mass, which gives rise to a gravity field. Here s: = gijrij-scalar curvature is simple to the wound-temporary and (gij) = (gij) −1. At the same time, the tensor field standing on the right side of the equation is the known tensor of the energy of the pulse of matter t. Its components Tij = t (∂i, ∂j) are symmetted and satisfy the condition d ∗ t = 0, which the type Gik∇itkj = 0. Using these conditions in [1], the classification of Einstein equations is carried out. Class ω2 Einstein's equations was awarded the condition dt = 0, which has the form ∇ktij = ∇itkj. This means that the tensor of energy-pulse is the tensor of Codazzi (see [2], p. 590–598). From the above conditions and Einstein’s equations, it will follow that DS = 0, that is, S is constant size, and DR = 0. Since on an arbitrary n-dimensional (pseudo before) the Rimannes of the conformal curvide of Weil w is true d ∗ w = - (n - 3) (n - 1) −1d [r - (2n - 2) −1s · g] (see [2], p. 589), we conclude that the condition t ∈ ω2 It is equivalent to the harmony of the tensor of conformal curvature, i.e., d ∗ w = 0, and the constancy of the scalar curvature of space-time, i.e., ds = 0. Note that in [1] it was proved only that the condition t ∈ ω2 occurs In conformally flat space-time with constant scalar curvature. Class ω3 Einstein's equations was distinguished by conditions (∇zr) (x, y) = 2 9 z (s) g (x, y) + 1 18 x (s) g (z, y) + 1 18 y (s) g (s) g (s) g (s) g (s) g (s) g (s) g (s) g (s) g (s) g (s) g (s) g Z, x) for any x, y, z ∈ TM. At the same time, the fact is known (see [3], p. 132) that all N-dimensional (pseudo) Rimannes of diversity, UPO 220 entering the conditions (∇ZR) (X, Y) = N (N-2) 2 (N - 1) (n + 2) (2 (n - 2) −1z (s) g (x, y) + + n --1x (s) g (z, y) + n -1y (s) g (z, X)) For any x, y, z ∈ TM, non -trivial geodetic display allows. For n = 4, both equations coincide, and therefore the spaces are temporarily, for which t ∈ ω3, non-trivial geodetic displays are allowed. Note that in [1] spaces-time, where the equations of this class have solutions, have not been described. L and T R A T R A 1. Stepanov S.E.
