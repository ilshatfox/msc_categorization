Materials of the International School-Conference of UDC 517.575 On the identity in the field for polygarmonic functions V.V. Karachik1 1 karachik@susu.ru; The South Ural State University in the article received identities for integrals in a single sphere from normal derivatives of polygarmonic functions in a single ball. Keywords: polygarmonic functions, normal derivatives, identity in the field. It is known that for the harmonic in the single ball s ⊂ rn the function u ∈ C m (s̄) is true of equality (see for example, [1]) ˆs ∂mu ∂νm d sx = 0, m ∈N, where ∂u ∂ ν is a derivative in the direction of the external normal to ∂s. This work finds out what other equations of this species can take place for normal derivatives from K-harmonic functions U (x), i.e. such functions that the engine U = 0 in S. In [2] the property of the average for polygarmonic functions has been investigated and some results were obtained on the basis of which this study was performed. Let the polynomes PN (t) are from the recurrent equality PN (t)+ (2n −3) pn -1 (t) = t 2pn -2 (t), n ≥ 2, where it should be assumed that p0 (t) = 1 , P1 (t) = 1. Theorem 1. For any Garmonic in S function u ∈C K (S̄) with k ≥ M, equality ˆs pm --i (∂ ∂ν) ∂2i u ∂ν2i d sx = 0, ˆ ∂s ∂ j u ∂ν j d sx = 0, where 0 ≤ i ≤ m −1 and 2m ≤ j ≤ k at 2m ≤ k. In the work [3], when studying the arithmetic triangle arising from the conditions for resolving the problem of Neumann for the polygarmonic equation, an arithmetic triangle was obtained, similar to an arithmetic triangle, which is the coefficients of PN (T) polynomas. Example. If the K-Harmonic in S function u ∈C K (S̄) satisfies the equations ∂ j u ∂ν j | ∂s = onic j (x), j = 1,. . . , k. u (x) - the solution of the homogeneous problem of the Neumann [4] for the polyarmonic equation in S, for the functions ventral С (x), j = 1 ,. . . , k, according to theorem 1, it is necessary to fulfill the condition [5] ∂s k∑ j = 1 (−1) j+k (2k - j −1 j −1) (2k −2 j −1)!

On Identites on the Unit Sphere for Polyharmonic Function v.V.

Krotov2 1 ikatkovskaya@bntu.by; Belarusian National Technical University 2 krotov@bsu.by; The Belarusian State University in the work gives the criteria for the compactness of the sets in the spaces ffic (L) consisting of the equivalence classes of measurable functions F, for which the composition nder ° f is summarized by the antimic space X with a measure that satisfies the condition of doubling. Here ∗: R → R is the even function, positive, continuous and increasing on (0,+urb), moreover, С (+0) = 0, limt → ger (t) = urb. In addition, it is assumed that ffic satisfies the ∆2-condition of the Orlich. Compactness criteria are formulated in terms of maximum operators that measure local smoothness. Key words: doubling condition, compactness, space of the summarized functions, maximum operators, local smoothness. Let (x, d, µ) - a limited metric space with a metric D and Borelevsky measure µ, satisfying the conditions of doubling µ (b (x, 2r)) ≤cµ (b (x, r)), x ∈ X, R> 0 where b (x, r) = {y ∈ X: D (x, y) <r}.
