Eberlain2 1 vbv57@inbox.ru; Belgorod State National Research University 2 649377@bsu.edu.ru; Belgorod State National Research University We are considering the regional task with the condition of the type of airship for a pair of elliptical pseudo -dialected equations in the flat angle in the spaces of Sobolev - Slobodetsky. It is shown that the unambiguous resolution of such a task is equivalent to 44 “Lobachev readings - 2019” of the resolution of the system of integrated equations built using wave factorization of elliptical characters. Keywords: pseudo -dysphored equation, resolution, regional task, we will recall some basic facts and methods [1.2] associated with the resolution of the pseudo -diodecture equation (Au+) (x) = f (x), x ∈C A+, (1) in the space in the space H s (c a +), where C A + is the M-dimensional cone C A + = {X ∈ RM: X = (X1, ..., XM-1, XM), XM> A | X ′ |, A > 0}, x ′ = (x1, ..., xm -1), a - pseudo -dyspen operator with a symbol a (hole) that satisfies the condition C1 ≤ | a (hole) (1+ | ξ |) −α | ≤ c2. (2) Such symbols are elliptical [1.2], and have order α ∈ R. By definition, the space H s (C A+) consists of (generalized) functions of the space H S (RM), the carriers of which are contained in C A+ . The norm in the space H S (C A+) is induced by the norm of space H S (RM). Denote ∗ C A+cone conjugated by the cone C A+: ∗ C A+= {x ∈RM: x = (x ′, xm), Axm> | x ′ |}, C A - ≡ c+, t (c+, t (c+ ) denotes the radial tubular area above the cone C A+, i.e. The area of ​​the multidimensional integrated space of the type RM + IC A + [3], the sign “∼“ denotes the transformation of Fourier: ũ (hole) ≡ (fu) (hole) = ∫ rm e --i x · mal (x) d x. To describe the picture of the resolution of equation (1) the following definition is introduced. The wave factorization of the symbol A (hole) of the cone C A+ is called its representation in the form of a (perf) = a ̸ = (hole) a = (hole), where the dubbaters are a ̸ = (ă), a = (ă) must satisfy the following Conditions: 1) a ̸ = (perf), a = (lection) are determined for all values ​​₽ ∈ Rm, except, possibly, points {ă rm: ξ ′ | 2 = a2urb2m}; 2) a ̸ = (lection), a = (lection) admit the analytical continuation of the gate tubular areas t (∗ c a+), t (∗ c a -) respectively with estimates | a ± 1̸ = (ă+ i) | ≤ c1 (1+ | ₽ |+ | τ |) ± a, | a ± 1 = (₽ - iτ) | ≤ c2 (1+ | ă+ | τ |) ± (α - a), ∀τ ∈ ∗ C A+. The number a ∈ R is called the index of wave factorization of the symbol A (hole). V.B. Vasiliev, N.V. Eberlain 45 Here we will consider the following task on the plane: Find a pair of functions u+∈ H S1, V - ∈ H S2 (R2 \ C A+), which I satisfy the equations (AU+) (x) = 0, x ∈C A+ , (3) (b v -) (x) = 0, x purpose of pseudo -dysphenerable operators with symbols a (hole), b (hole), satisfying the condition (2) with order α, β, respectively. Here we assume that the indices of the wave factorization a, b characters a (hole), b (ă) are such that a - S1 = 1+Δ1, B - S2 = 1+Δ2, | Δ1 | <1/2, | Δ2 | <1/2. According to the theory developed in [2], the general solutions of equations (3), (4) have the form ũ+(hole) = a - 1̸ = (ă) (c̃0 (ă – a ed)+d̃0 (ă+aising)), (5) ṽ - (perf) = b - 1 = (perf) (ξ0 (ă1 —Aă) + q̃0 (ă1 + aising)), (6) where C0, D0, R0, Q0 - arbitrary functions of one variable, C0 , d0 ∈ H s ′ 1 (r+), r0, q0 ∈ H s ′ 2 (r -), s’s = sk - 1/2, k = 1.2. To determine 4 arbitrary functions, one integral condition is set (this establishes the relationship between pairs C0, D0 and R0, Q0) and the linear combination of the boundary values ​​of U+ and V -, like [4], as a result of which it turns out (2 × 2) a system of linear integral equations. The resolution of the last system of linear integrated equations is equivalent to solvability of the set margin. The work was carried out with financial support from the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (project 1.7311.2017/8.9). Literature 1. Eskin G. I.
