Chernyshevsky 2 Terekhinpa@mail.ru; Saratov National Research State University named after N.G. Chernyshevsky established that the sequence {kζn} ger n = 1, where kζ (z) = (1 - ζ̄z) −1 is the core of the segha of the Hardy H 2 (D) space, is the frame in h 2 (d) relative to the banakh's space the fulfillment of some conditions for the sequence {ζn} ger n = 1 in pairs of different points of the single circle D. Key words: banks Freim, model space of the frame, reproducing the nucleus, the space of hard. Banahov’s space X, consisting of numerical sequences x = {xn} ger n = 1, is called model if the canonical orthic {en} ger n = 1 forms the basis in X. The conjugated space X ∗ to the model space X is isometrically isomorphic to the banakh space Y, consisting of numerical sequences y = {yn} mmn = 1. The corresponding isomorphism is given by equality yn = (en, x ∗), n = 1.2 ,. . . where x ∗ ∈ X ∗, and ∥y∥y: = ∥x ∗ ∥x ∗. Further X is a model space. The sequence {fn} mmn = 1 non -zero elements of the banahov space F is called the frame in the relative x, if there are constant 0 <a ≤ b <mm, such that for each continuous linear functionality g ∈G = f ∗ The sequence of its Fourier coefficients {( fn, g)} φn = 1 satisfies the inequalities a∥g∥g ≤ ∥ {(fn, g)} و = 1∥y ≤ b∥g∥g. If F = G = H is the Hilbert space and x = y = ℓ2, then the frame in H is a syncetic ℓ2 in the sense of the previous definition coincides with the “ordinary” frame of the Duffin -Scheffer [1]. Every frame {fn} و = 1 V F relative to X is a representation system, i.e. For any vector F ∈ F, there is a numerical sequence x = {xn} mmn = 1 ∈ X such that (see [2]) f = و n = 1 xn fn. The opposite is also true: the arbitrary representation system {fn} و = 1 ⊂ f \ {0} forms a frame in F relative (generally un UNITY) model space X. Let h 2 = h 2 (d) - the space of hardy, consisting of all analytical functions f (z), z ∈D = (| z | <1), for which the norm is finite ∥ f ∥ = sup 0 <r <1 ( 1 2π ˆ 2π 0 | f (r ei t) | 2 d t) 1/2. 338 Materials of the International School-Conference are well known that the space H 2 is a functional calbert space, i.e. It has a reproducing nucleus f (ζ) = (f, kζ), kζ (z) = 1 1- ζ̄z, ζ ∈D, which is called the core of the sege (or the core nucleus). Let {ζn} inous = 1 - a sequence of pairs of different points of a single circle D. The classic task of restoring the analytical function according to its values ​​at these points lies in the (unambiguous) definition f (ζ) for arbitrary ζ ∈D for known values ​​f (ζn) , n = 1.2 ,. . . . Note that the very possibility of such a restoration significantly depends on the choice of the space of functions (see, for example, [3]). Here we consider the space of Hardy H 2. Firstly, a necessary condition for a positive solution to the restoration problem is the denial of the condition to plaques φ∑ n = 1 (1- | ζn |) = urb, (1) since otherwise the product to plaque b (z ) = ∏icle = 1 ζ̄n | ζn | ζn --Z1 - ζ̄n z connises, b ∈ H 2, b ̸ = 0, but at the same time b (ζn) = 0, n = 1.2 ,. . . . Secondly, as follows from the theorem [4], for each sequence {ζn} ger n = 1 that satisfies the condition (1), there is such a family of polynomials PN, K, N = 1.2,. . . , k = 1 ,. . . , n, that for all F ∈ H 2, the idea is F = Lim N → → → → K = 1 F (ζk) Pn, K, which solves the restoration problem. A natural question arises: is the presentation of an arbitrary function F ∈ H 2 in the form of a row F = ger∑ n = 1 xNKζn according to the elements of the function of the functions {kζn} ger n = 1 with some coefficients {xn} ger n = 1 (generally speaking, non -linear Depending on F) or, equivalent, is the sequence of nuclei Sege {kζn} ger n = 1 frame in H 2 relative to some model space X? It is clear that if such an idea is possible, then believing in it f = kζ, ζ ∈D, and multiplying scalarly by g ∈ H 2, we get the recovery formula (in which xn = xn (ζ)) g (ζ) = nder∑ n = 1 x̄n g (ζn). The uniqueness of such a restoration (unity G) is ensured by the fact that each frame is a complete system. We will show that the answer to the question posed will be positive when fulfilling additional conditions on {ζn} mmn = 1. Namely, suppose that the sequence of “radii” {rk} ger k = 1 satisfies the conditions 0 <r1 <. . . <rk <rk+1 <. . . , lim k → φ rk = 1, (2) K.S. Speransky, P.A. Terekhin 339 and the sequence of natural numbers {nk} φ k = 1 is such that a nk ≤ 1 - rk ≤ b nk, k = 1.2 ,. . . , (3) for some permanent 0 <a ≤ b <mm. Consider the sequence of points {ζn} ger n = 1 of a special type ζn = ζk, j = rk e2πi j /nk, j = 0 ,. . . , Nk −1, k = 1.2 ,. . . , i.e. Association of K-blocks consisting of points {ζK,
