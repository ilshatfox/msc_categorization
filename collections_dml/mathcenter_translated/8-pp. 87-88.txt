) The limits of the function in the categories of coverage and covering groups in algebraic topology are well known for the following fact. If P: X → G is the cover of a linearly coherent and local linearly connected group G of a linearly coherent space X, then in X there is a group structure that turns P into the homomorphism of groups [1; Theorem 79]. It turns out that for the endless cover of a compact coherent group with a coherent covering space, this theorem is also fair. This result is based on the fact mentioned above and the theorem 1 formulated below, which, speaking of the inconspicuous, claims that any N-lord cover of this group is approximated by the n-lis covers of smooth groups. Let's move on to the exact wording. Let N-COV be a category, the objects of which are the N-lute covers of compact coherent groups with compact connected connecting spaces. Morphism between the two objects p: x → g and Q: Y → H of this category we define as pair (F: x → Y, h: g → h), consisting of continuous display and continuous homomorphism, such that Q ° F = H ® p. The composition of morphisms is determined in a standard way, as in the category of morphisms from the arbitrary category. Through N-Cov Diff, we denote the subcategory in n-cov, consisting of coverage of groups, or, in other words, subcategoria of groups without small subgroups [2]. Theorem 1. For each object p ∈ N-COV, there is a controversial function F: γP → N-COV from the category of a directed set γP, such that P is a projective limit F in N-COV and F accepts the values ​​of N-COV DIFF. 87 Theorem 2. Let P: X → G - the endpoint cover of the compact coherent group G with a coherent topological space X. Then you can introduce the structure of the topological group in space X, such that P will become the homomorphism of compact groups. Moreover, in the case of the Abel group G, display P becomes the homomorphism of compact abele groups. Previously, theorem 2 was proved for the case of solenoids in [3]. L and T R A T R A 1.
