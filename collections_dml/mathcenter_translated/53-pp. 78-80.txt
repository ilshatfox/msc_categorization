The study of the dynamics of a piece of curve display with the parameter is a simple discrete dynamic system is determined by a certain function F: X → X and the infinite sequence of its iterations. The main task of describing such a system we are to study the behavior of the orbit of any point X from D. R. Kadyrov, A.I. Kukushkina, a. D. Pechenkina, A. A. Rakhimov 79 areas of determination X function f. In the last decade, the study of the dynamics of the symmetric and asymmetric stunt-like (piece-line) display has been given serious attention. The spectrum of the application of these displays in biology, ecology, robotics, electroenergy and electrical engineering, economics and social on uki is widely represented (see, e.g., [1–5]). One of the directions of further study of the tumor of different reflection is the study of the case when the function F is not a piece of line. An example of such functions that can be of interest to applications is F (x) = {AXα, 0 6 x 6 1, Axβ, X> 1. (1) The study of the dynamics of the display (1), which depends on three parameters, is very difficult task. Therefore, we consider some particular cases when showing the degrees in the system are recorded and F depends on one parameter A. In the work, the dynamics of two non -linear ten -to -shaped displays with fractional degrees of the variable, including negative: f1 (x) = {Ax1/2, 0 6 x 6 1, Ax1/3, X> 1. F2 (x) = {{{{{{{{{{ AX3/2, 0 6 x 6 1, AX -1/3, X> 1. For all the intervals of the settings of parameter A obtained during the study, fixed points and periodic orbits of data data, the types of these points and orbits were found, built Web and bifur casual diagrams. Thus, a complete description of the orbit of any point X from the area of ​​determination of each of the functions F1 and F2 is given. 80 D.V. Captain, M.E. Suslova L and Tr. T R A 1. Brockwell P.J.
