Stationary electrochemical formation of a dual cathode with an isolated side wall of S.S. Kharchuk Kazan State University by the hydrodynamic analogue of this task Echo is the task of determining the border of the fluid of AB with the AC current line to one hundred and/ x,/- ·- ·- · on the following boundary conditions: IP = O, d/ d/ d/ d/ d/ d/ /f 1 dp = cosfj on AB; tp = o on aircraft; ! JFL on the AC, where RP is the speed potential, 1 // - the function of the current of the complex potential W. The problem was solved by the method of hydrofl's hydrographs soon (see [j]) using the device of the theory of functions of a comprehensive variable. The algorithm for calculating an unknown anode of the AB was built. It is shown that AB is described by an equation of 1 {j 1 {j 1! 2 'with FL+I j v dv j v · dv z = z (t) = -t those (v · t-1) 0 .ji · v · t-t' /3 $) /2. For lowering FJ = L/2, a solution was obtained in elementary functions. Literature 1. Karimov Ah., Klokov in "Filatov E.I.
