) The display of the polygons was obtained different from [1] by setting and the method of solving the generalization of the Schwarz -Cristophel formula in case of display of the upper half -plane with a versatile number of peaks. Exactly, even if DZ is a single -link area, the border of which consists of two broken L1z and L 2 Z with a common point A0 (0, 0), composed of an infinitely number of rectilinear links. We denote through A1, A2, · · · · Verses LZ, numbered sequentially when moving in a positive direction along L1z from point A0, A -1, A -2, · · · · - vertices L2Z. When moving along L1z, starting from point A0, the DZ area remains on the left, and when moving along L2Z from point A0 on the right. The angles η10π, η 2 0π (0 ≤ η10π <2π, η20π - η10π <π/2), formed with a real axis, with the beginning at point A0 L1Z, L 2 Z, respectively, αkπ (0 <αk <1, <1kk <1, respectively, are considered known. ), α -kπ (1 <α -k <2) - internal angles in relation to the area at the vertices ak, a -k, k = 1, urb. It is required to determine the conformal display Z (ζ) of the upper half -plane in the plane of the complex alternating ζ = ă+ iη to the DZ region, so that the contour L1z corresponds to the actual semi -shaft ă> 0, 102 of the coordinate begins to point A0, the end of the line l1z corresponds to the point ζ = +∞. Choose TK, T -K - the points of the axis IMζ = 0, which are prototypes, respectively, the vertices of AK, A -K contour LZ. It is clear that 0 <tk <tk +1, t --k - 1 <t -k <0, k = 1, inous, limk → ° tk = +urb, limk → ∞ t --k = − least. In addition, the choice of sequences {α ± k}, {t ± k} is subordinated to additional restrictions. By the method of studying one homogeneous task of Hilbert with the counting multitude of points of rupture of the coefficients, the structural formula Z (ζ) = ζ∫ 0 ei op 1 0π ζ1 - (η 2 0–η10) ∏imes k = 1 (1– ζ q) α- k - 1 ∏icles k = 1 (1– ζ tk) 1 --αk dζ declared display.

Svetlov (Volgograd, Andrew.svetlov@mf.volsu.ru) The discreteness of the spectrum of the Schrödinger operator on the curved works we will consider Rimanovo diversity Z, isometric work X × Y (where X and Y are arbitrary diversity of dimensions N and M, respectively) with metric DZ2 = DX2 + γ2 (x) DY2, where γ (x) is c1 - cordinal positive function, dx2 and dy2 - metrics on X and Y, respectively. Such diversity zs are called curved Riman works. Let the Borelev measure µ are set on z. We will assume that µ has a density σ (z), where σ (z) = τ (x) η (y), τ (x) and η (y) - c1 - cordous positive functions. Consider the weight diversity (Z, µ) and OPE 103
