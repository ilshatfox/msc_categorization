Restoration of the coefficients of the rows according to some orthogonal systems of functions, let P = {Pi} ger-a sequence of natural numbers that are different from 1. Let's call the P-system or the system of multiplier functions of the price, or the system of generalized functions of Haar (see [2]) built according to the corresponding P, and denote it {ther (x)} φ0. The behavior of a row according to the P-system ∑ anaper (x) is completely described by the martingal sequence of private sums SMN (x), where m0 = 1, mn = p1. . . Pn. Let SMN (x) converge almost everywhere on [0, 1) to f (x) at n → ∞. How to restore the coefficients of a row on F (x)? In the general case, the question is incorrect, since there can be several such ranks, so it is necessary to impose additional conditions on a series that ensure its unity. They can be expressed in terms of the majority of private sums S ∗ (x): = supn edn | SMN (x) | . It turns out that if P is limited, i.e., Sup pn <∞, then there is a theorem 1. Let the martingal sequence of private sums SMN (x) in the P-system, where P is limited, converges almost everywhere to the function f (x) And has a majority, such that one of the conditions is fulfilled: 1) there is a sequence that increases to infinity {λk} φ1, such that lim k → ă λkµ {x ∈ [0, 1): s ∗ (x) λk} = 0 2) lim λ → φ λµ {x ∈ [0, 1): s ∗ (x)> λ} = 0. (1) 142 then, subject to 1), the nth coefficient of this series is restored by function F ( x) according to the formulas an = lim k → φ ∫ 1 0 [f (x) onic (x)] ηk dx, where ηk = λk √ ms, k ∈ N, ms -1 ≤ n ≤ ms - 1 (m - 1 = 0) if the series is considered according to the generalized Haar system, and ηk = λk, if the row is considered according to the Walsh system; And subject to 2) a series of P-system is a nearby Fourier of Functions F (X) in the sense of A-integral. Proof of theorem 1 is based on work methods [1], where a similar issue is studied for the Franklin system. Theorem 1 covers, in particular, all the rows of Fourier (in the sense of the usual integral of the Lebeg), since any row of Fourier according to the PSISist, even without the condition of limited P, satisfies (1). Therefore, provided that when F (x) is integrated, the corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions for the belonging of a row of the Fourier rows, for example, (1), from the theorem 1, follow from the theorem 1. Theorem 1 can also be proved for some generalizations of the anintegra, as well as get rid of the requirement so that SMN (X) converges almost everywhere. Without limitations P, the above results are incorrect, even if (1) and F (x) is integrated, namely, the theorem 2. For any PN-system is true, such that SUP PN = ∞ is not equal to a number of this system, which is identical to zero, Satisfying (1), and in which SMN (x) → 0 is almost everywhere.
