Materials of the School-Conference of UDC 517.982.22+517.982.27 On some problems of the theory of disjunctic homogeneous symmetrical spaces S.V. Astashkin1 1 Astash56@mail.ru; Samara National Research University named after S.P. The queen is a brief overview of the recent results of the author, which solve some problems associated with the theory of disjunctic homogeneous symmetrical spaces and its applications. Keywords: Banakhov grille, symmetrical space, compact operator, strictly Singolar operator, dysjunctic homogeneous barbell, p-dizy, homogeneous bankhov grate. Banakhov’s grate is called disjunctic uniform (e ∈ D H), if any two sequences {xn} and {yn} in pairs of disjunctic normalized elements in E contain equivalent sub -exercises. This means that there is an increasing sequence of natural numbers {nk} and constant C> 0 such that for arbitrary AK ∈R, K = 1.2 ,. . . The inequality was fulfilled: C - 1 ∥∥∥ ipp∑ K = 1 AK XNK ∥∥∥ E ≤ ∥∥∥ µ k = 1 AK YNK ∥∥∥ E ≤c ​​∥∥∥ µ k = 1 AK XNK ∥∥∥ E. In particular, for this 1 ≤ p ≤ brid, it is said that the Banakhov grate is E P-Dizjunctally homogeneous (e ∈ PH), if any normalized disjunctic sequence in E contains an undergoing, equivalent to the canonical basis of LP (C0, if p = inous ). Obviously, each P-DH Banakhov grate also has a DH. At the same time, there are DH lattices that do not have a P-DH property at any 1 ≤ p ≤ brid (for example, the space of the circle). These concepts, introduced in [1], turned out to be very useful in the study of the ratios between different classes of operators operating in banana lattices. Recall that the linear operator, limited from one banahov space to another, is called strictly singular, if no narrowing on endless subspace is isomorphism. This concept was introduced by T. Kato in connection with the solution of some problems of the theory of disturbances of Fredgolm operators [2]. It is known [3, the offer 2.C.10] that the sum of the strictly singular and Fredgolm operators is still a Fredgolm operator with the same index, and therefore, the spectra of strictly singular and compact operators have very close properties. How easy it is to see, many strictly singular operators form a closed operator ideal that contains the ideal of compact operators. At the same time, according to the classical theorem of J. Kalkin [4], the latter is the only non -trivial closed ideal of operators limited in the Hilbert space. Therefore, in this case, the ideals of strictly singular and compact operators coincide [2]. A similar result is also true for LP spaces, 1 ≤ p <mm, and C0 [5]. About such spaces, they say that they have S.V. Astashkin 41 Cato property. As for the functional spaces, LP [0.1] is not a CATO space with p ̸ = 2. Indeed, firstly, since the spaces of LP and LQ (C0, if p = inous), 1 ≤ p ̸ = q ≤ ∞, do not have common infinite subspaces (see, for example, [6, consequence 2.1.6]), then the identical investment I: lp → lq is strictly singular for any p <q. In addition, any normalized disjunctic sequence {xn} ⊂ lr [0.1] is equivalent to LR [0.1] with the canonical base LR, 1 ≤ R ≤ently, and the closed linear shell [xn] is supplemented with LR [0.1] [6, sentence 6.4.1]. On the other hand, according to the inequality of Khinchin, the Rademacher {rn} system is equivalent to LR [0.1] for each R <aged canonical basis L2 and, in the same way, the closed linear shell [rn] is supplemented with LR [0.1] under 1 <r <mm (see, for example, [6, theorem 6.2.3]). If now {xn} ⊂ lp [0.1] is an arbitrary normalized disjunctic sequence, then from the above facts it follows that in the case of p> 2 operator t1: = j1i1p1: lp [0.1] → lp [0.1] where P1 is a projector from LP [0.1] on [rn], i1 (φ∑ n = 1 anrn): = ger∑ n = 1 an xn, and J1: [xn] → lp [0.1] - The operator of an identical investment is strictly singular, but not compact. If 1 ≤ p <2, the same can be said about the operator t2: = j2i2p2: lp [0.1] → lp [0.1], where P2 is a projector from LP [0.1] on [xn], i2 (Φ∑ n = 1 an xn): = φ∑ n = 1 anrn, and J2: [rn] → lp [0.1] - the operator of an identical investment. At the same time, the classical theorem of V. D. Milman [7] is well known, from which it follows that for any strictly singular operator t: lp (µ) → LP (µ) operator t 2 compact. Recently, in [8], this statement was extended to some classes of DH banners. Moreover, along with other results, its authors have proved that each 2-DH Banakhov grate has a final cat (Rademacher) has the property of Kato [8, theorem 2.12]. More information about the introduced concepts and, in particular, examples of DH, PDH of banach grilles, as well as banach spaces with the property of CATO, see [1,8–12]. The purpose of this note is in a brief presentation of recent progress in solving a number of problems in the theory of DH Reshetok, formulated
