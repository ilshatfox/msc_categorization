The approximate solution of equation (1) is searched in the form of a polynomial wor (t) = n∑ k = 0 αkt k = n∑ k = 0 βktk (t), n + 1 ∈ N, αk, βk ∈ C; Tk (t) = cos k arccos t, (2) unknown coefficients of which are determined from the system of linear algebraic equations (SLAU) n∑ k = 0 αka (t k; tj) = n∑ k = 0 βka (tk; tj) = f) (tj), j = 0, n, (3) where {tj} n0 is a certain system of nodes from [-1,1], or from SLAU n∑ k = 0 αkcj (at k) = n∑ k = 0 βkcj (atk) a (tk; tj) = cj (f), j = 0, n, (4) where cj (y) = 2 π 1∫ −1 y (t) tj (t) dt√ 1– t2 , y ∈ L (−1; 1). 62 We denote the many polynomenses of the species through HN (2), and through W 12 (ρ) = w 1 2 (ρ; [−1, 1]) and l2 (ρ) = l2 (ρ; [−1, 1]) - Full weight spaces, respectively, Sobolev and Lebeg with Libra ρ = ρ (t) = (1- t2) −1/2 and with conventional norms and scalar works. Theorem 1. Let the conditions fulfilled: a) f (t) ∈ W 12 (ρ), and the functions h0 (t, τ) and h1 (t, τ) are such that the operator b: w 12 (ρ) → W 12 ( ρ) is quite continuous, b (onic; t) = 1∫ −1 h0 (t, τ) onic (τ) dτ + 1∫ −1 h1 (t, τ) ′ (τ) dτ, b) the nodes are determined by Any of the formulas tj = cos j drop, tj = cos 2j + 1 2n + 2 π, j = 0, n, (5) c) Operator A: W 12 (ρ) → W 12 (ρ) continuously turn.

Approximate decisions (2) converge to the exact solution onic (t) = a - 1 (f; t) in the space W 12 (ρ) with a speed determined by the inequalities: en - 1 (∗ ′) l2, ρ ≤ en (∗) W 12 (ρ) ≤ ‖ices - onic‖w 12 (ρ) = o {en (∗) W 12 (ρ)} = o {en - 1 (onic ′) l2 (ρ)}, (6) where EN (ip) W 12 (ρ) = ρ (onic, Hn) W 12 (ρ), EN -1 (∗ ′) l2 (ρ) = ϕ (∗ ′, HN -1) L2 (ρ). Theorem 2. In the conditions of theorem 1, the Collocation method (1), (2), (3), (5) and the method of moments (1), (2), (4) are optimal in order [1] among all kinds of direct methods of solving the equation (1), allowing you to build an approximate solution in the form of a polynomial (2). 63 Let the unknown coefficients α1, α2 ,. . . , αn and β1, β2 ,. . . , βn polynomials (2) are determined from the SLAU, respectively, n∑ k = 0 αk (at k, atj) = (f, atj), j = 0, n, (7) n∑ k = 0 βk (atk, atj) = (f, atj), j = 0, n, (8) where (gment, ψ) is a scalar product of the functions ∗, ψ ∈ W 12 (ρ) in space W 12 (ρ). The next theorem follows the justification, as well as the optimality [1] of the method of the smallest squares (1), (2), (7), (8) in space W 12 (ρ). Theorem 3. Let the function h0 (t, τ) and h1 (t, τ) are such that the operator a: w 12 (ρ) → W 12 (ρ) is continuously turn. Then each of the SLAU (7), (8) is unambiguously resolved at any n = 0, 1,. . .
