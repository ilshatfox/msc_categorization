Mixed methods for solving nonlinear singular integral equations in the material hyalbert space of the L2 squares 2? R-periodic functions are studied in prisons of unambiguous resolution and close mixed methods for solving non-linear syngular in the tertiary equation of the type AIP = A (S) IP (S) + L 1 b (s) j (ip; s) + l2f (s, <p (s) + + LZF (s, <p (s), j (h (ip); s)) = f (s ), (1) 21r j <p = j (ip; s) = 2 ~.! <p (a) ctg a ~ 8 da, about where aj is arbitrary material parameters, a (s), b (s), f (s), f (s, i), h (a, and), f ( S, and, V) - known substances ~ the functions of their arguments about :::; s, a ~ 271 ", Lill <OO, LVL <OO, I.K. Rakhimov, and. N. Tikhonov 241 EP (s) - the desired function, singular integrates are understood in the sense of the main value of the Koshi - Lebeug (1]. Here is a computing scheme of one of the mixed cities of the solution of the equation (1). We look for an approximate solution in the form of a trigonometric polynoma 2 n 'pn (s) = n i> Â· k dn (s - SK), n = [n/2], (2 ) k = l where is DN - ordinary at n = 2n + 1 and modestial with n = 2p the nucleus of the conductor (see "for example, [2]), and sk = 2g/n, k = 1, n. Unknown coefficients {qk} We determine from the condition that the function (2) is a solution to the equation (3) -;: () where s n is the operator of the average zero -degree interpolation on the node grid {SK}. It is shown that under the determined conditions on the known functions as an equation as an equation (1), and the equation (3) have the only solutions. At the same time, the found close solutions converge to the exact solution of the equation (1) with the speed determined by the integral continuity module accurate decision. Literature 1.
