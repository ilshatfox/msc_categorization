The task of the flow of viscous barotropic gas in a single case1 A.V. Popov, D. G. Slugin Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, Moscow built an implicit diverse scheme for a one -dimensional system of equations describing the flow of viscous barotropic gas in Euler variables. For a variety scheme, its convergence has been proved and an assessment of the error in the net norm W 12 was obtained, provided that the smoothness of the differential problem is sufficient. Introduction by the construction and analysis of variable schemes for systems of gas dynamics equations is of significant practical and theoretical interest [1] - [5]. Currently, for the tasks of the 1st work, it was performed with the financial support of the RFFIF, the project No. 05-0100511 197 on the task of the flow of viscous barotropic gas in a single case of one-dimensional movement of viscous gas in the variables of Lagrange obtained a number of theoretical results [6, 7] and various schemes were built [8, nine]. However, in many real physical tasks, it is required to conduct gas movement calculations in Euler variables, which requires the construction and study of different schemes in these variables. In this area, significantly fewer results were obtained. An article [10] conducted a theoretical study of the existence of generalized solutions for the problems of gas dynamics in Euler variables. The work [11,12] is considered by the construction of variable schemes in the case of gas convection in a closed space, the convergence of the proposed schemes and the assessment of errors is proved. This work is devoted to the construction and study of a variety scheme for a one -dimensional task of leakage barotropic gas in Euler variables. For a variety scheme, its convergence has been proved and an assessment of the error of numerical integration in normal W 12 was obtained, subject to sufficient smoothness of the exact solution of the differential problem. 1 The setting of the problem Consider the system of equations that describes the non -stationary one -dimensional flow of viscous barotropic gas: ∂ρ ∂t + ∂ρu ∂x = 0, ρ [∂u ∂u + u ∂u ∂x] + ∂p ∂x = µ ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u ∂2u x2 + ρf, p = p (ρ). (1.1) The desired values ​​- density ρ and speed U - are the functions of the variables of Euler (t, x) ∈ Q = [0, t] × [0, x]. The viscosity coefficient µ will be considered a positive constant. In addition, the equations include two more well -known functions p = p (ρ) and f = f (t, x). Complete the system (1.1) with the initial and regional conditions: (ρ, u) | t = 0 = (ρ0, u0) x ∈ [0, x], (1.2) u (t, 0) = u1 (t)> 0, u (t, x) = u2 (t)> 0, 198 A. V. Popov, D. G. Slugin ∂ρ ∂x (t, 0) = ρx (t) t ∈ [0, t]. (1.3) Suppose the fulfillment of the following conditions: a) there is the only classic solution to the problem (1.1) - (1.3); B) ρ, u ∈ C3.2 (q), where CP, Q (Q) is a class of functions that have derivatives of order P according to the spatial variable X and order Q for a variable T in the area Q; C) γ1> ρ (t, x)> γ2> 0 for (t, x) ∈ Q; D) b> u1 (t)> 0; u2 (t)> a> 0; E) p ∈ C2 (γ), where γ = [γ2/2; γ1 +γ2/2], max (t, x) ∈ C | F (t, x) | = FC <inous. 2 The variable scheme use the designations adopted in [13]. In the area q, we introduce the netting QτH = ω̄τ × ω̄H, where ω̄τ = {nτ | n = 0,. . . , N}, t = nτ, ω̄h = {mh | m = 0 ,. . . , M}, x = mH. The value of the function G, determined on the QτH grid, in the node (n, m) we will denote through GNM. If the indices are lowered, then this means that they are equal to N and M. To reduce the recording of the function G from the temporary layer (n + 1), we denote GN + 1m = ĝ. For different operators, the designations are applicable to gt = gn+1m - gnm τ, gx = gnm+1 - gnm h, gsis x = gnm+1 - gnm -1 2h, gx̄ = gnm - gnm - 1 h. We introduce scalar works of functions set on the mesh ω̄h: (u, v) = m - 1∑ m = 1 humvm, (u, v] = m∑ m = 1 humvm, (u, v [= m - 2∑ m = m = m = m = m = m = m = m = m - 2∑ m = 1 HUMVM. 199 On the task of the flow of viscous barotropic gas in one case, in one case, we denote through functions h and v, the variable solution of the problem (1.1) - (1.1) - (1.3). The function values ​​set the close density values ​​in the nodes of the mesh, v - speed. To determine the functions H and V, we use the variable scheme ĥx, 0 = ρx ((n + 1) τ), ht + 1 2 (ĥv) x̄ + 1 2 v ĥx + 1 2 HVX̄ = 0, x ∈ ωH, (2.1) ĥxx̄ - m - 1 = 0; v̂0 = u1 (n + 1) τ), vt + 1 3 (v̂) x̄ + 1 3 v̂x + p (h) x̄ h = µ h v̂xx̄ + f, x ∈ ωh, (2.2) v̂m = u2 (n+ 1) τ). The initial conditions for the scheme (2.1), (2.2) take in the form of projections on the mesh ω̄h functions specified in the condition (1.2): h0m = ρ0 (mh), v 0 m = u0 (mh), m = 0,., m. (2.3) Theorem 2.1. The solution of the variable scheme (2.1)-(2.3) on (n + +1) -m temporary layer exists and only under vm conditions- 2, vm -1> 0, (2.4) τ <2h/b, (2.5) hi> 0, i = 1. . .M - 1. (2.6) remark 2.1. From the theorem 2.2 proven below, it follows that the fulfillment of the conditions of theorem 2.1 can be provided by selecting in a certain way τ and h. Proof. Suppose that a solution was found on the N-m time layer. Then the different solution on (n+1) -m layer Hn+1 = (Hn+10,., H n+1 m) t, v n+1 = (v n+11,., V n+ 1 m - 1) t 200 A. V. Popov, D. G.
