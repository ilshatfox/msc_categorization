-ПРИВОДИМОСТЬ УПРАВЛЯЕМЫХ СИСТЕМ ДИФФЕРЕНЦИАЛЬНЫХ УРАВНЕНИЙ  В. А. Зайцев  Удмуртский государственный университет, г. Ижевск,  verba@udm.ru  Рассматривается линейная управляемая система дифферен циальных уравнений  ẋ = A(t)x+B(t)u, (t, x, u) ∈ R1+n+m, (1) with a piece of unrefectant coefficients. Controlled on R. Control in the system (1) is built in the form of U = U (T) X, where u (t), t ∈ R, - - - This (m × n) is an impact function with limited pieces of line continuous coefficients (such controls U (t) will be called permissible). The corresponding closed system has the form of ẋ = (a (t) +b (t) u (t)) x, (2) two systems ẋ = p (t) x and ẏ = q (t) y are called asymptotitis if it is equivalent if There is a transformation of a new one x = l (t) y, connecting these systems, where L (t) is a matrix 102 Lipunov, that is, a piece of smooth function, such that SUP T {| L (t) | + | L - 1 (t) | + | L̇ (t) |} <mm. System (2) is called λ-conducted [1], if for any λ ∈ R there is permissible control of uλ (t), in which the system (2) is asymptotically equivalent to the ẋ = (a (t) + λi) X system. This definition is associated with the definition of λ-transformation (see [2, p. 249]), which is in addition to the matrix A (t) of indignation λi. The spectrum of Lyapunov’s indicators of the indignant system is shifted to λ. Theorem. Let the system (1) are evenly controlled. Then the system (2) λ-led. The investigation 1. Let the system (1) are evenly controlled. Then for any λ there is the permissible control of Uλ (t), in which the indicators of the system of the system (2) are satisfied with equations λj (a + buhλ) = λj (a) + λ. If the senior indicator of the linear system is negative, then the system is asymptotically stable. The investigation 2. Let the system (1) is evenly controlled. Then the system (2) is stabilized.
