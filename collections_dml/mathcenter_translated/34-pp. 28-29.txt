The tensor of deformation of the connectedities induced by the equipment of Bortoloty of the centered variety of Grassman O. Belov Russian State University named after I. Kant, G. Kaliningrad, olga_omelyan2002@mail.ru The projective space PN dimensions n is assigned to the mobile repera {a, ai} (i, j, k = 1,., N). In the PN space, the centered diversity of the grassma is considered on V 0 = GR0 (M, N) [1], that is, the family of all M-dimensional bones passing through a fixed point. A specialization of the mobile rapper {a, AA, AA, AA (A = 1,., M; α = m+1,., N): the vertex A is placed at a given point, and the AA tire is on the centered plane L ∗ m = [a, aa]. When fixing points A, the projective space PN turns into a centroproject space p ∗ n. Above variety V 0, the main stratification G ∗ (V 0) arises, the typical layer of which is the subgroup of the stationarity G ∗ of the centered plane l ∗ m ∈ V 0. In the main stratification of G ∗ (v 0), the connectivity is set according to g. F. Lapteva using the object of the coherence γ = {γacbα, γαAβγ, γabαβ, γbaα, γaαβ}. Bortolotti of the centered multiple of the Grassman V 0, which consists in connecting to each centered plane l ∗ m (n-m-1)-dimensional plane PN-M-1, which does not have common points with it. The plane PN - M -1 is set by the totality of points Bα = Aα + λ A αAA + λαA. Equipment of Bortolotti, set by the field of quasiTrezor λ = {λaα, λα} on diversity v 0, induces the connectedness of the three types in the stratification G ∗ (v 0). 30 The deformations of the connectedness of the 2nd 02 γ and 3rd 03 γ tie in relation to the connectedness of the 1st type 01 γ. The object of deformation σ [2] was introduced, when the specifics of the sensation of the connectivity {γabαβ, γaαβ} components of the equipment of the equipment λ coincide, in the conversion of which in zero. It is proved that the objects of deformation are distinguished by the multiplier form a tensor containing the simplest shade [3]. L and T R and T R A 1. Belova O.
