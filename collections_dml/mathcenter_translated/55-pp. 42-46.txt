Materials of the Youth School-Conference UDC 004.42 The method of forming a semantic representation of digital mathematical documents P.O. Gafurova1 1 polina_gafurova@yahoo.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky proposed a method of semantic submission of documents of the digital mathematical collection. The design of a semantic description of collections, the service for their processing, the tools of semantic search and presentation. Key words: semantic web, semantics, Omdoc, semantic representation of mathematical documents. The work is a continuation of research conducted in [1] and is devoted to the development of methods for introducing semantics into electronic mathematical documents based on the formats OMDOC, STEX and others (see, e.g., [2], [3]). The presence of a large number of sources obliges to present funds for processing information on the Internet. Naturally, each sphere of scientific knowledge is characterized by features. Vramatematimatimromertakkakki designs are theorems, lemma, evidence, and most importantly, formulas. These designs have their own values ​​and, therefore, for machine processing, it is necessary to include some hidden information in them, in particular metadata. To process mathematical documents, it is necessary to bring them into a semantic appearance. The introduction of semantics in Web is a distinctive feature of Web 3.0. Elements of semantics can be found now, for example, in the German -speaking Wikipedia. Also, as an example, one can note the Kwark project aimed at introducing semantics in various documents, including mathematical [4], [5]. To introduce semantics into mathematical documents, the Kwark project offers the language of submission of mathematical documents - Omdoc [2], [6]. OMDOC is a document in its structure with a document with mathematical formulas included in it. This format was taken by us as the basis for the development of the language of semantic description of mathematical documents. This format began to be developed back in 2000 and is still not fully developed, since there are problems in mathematical documents that have not yet been solved [7]. Despite the fact that the format began to be developed a long time ago, there are no works related to the visual presentation of documents in this language - the language is the basis for some other outproots of the KWARK project. However, it is possible to use the transformations to withdraw information from the file to the screen [1], [5]. For the semantic representation of the formulas, Mathml language, also based on XML [8] is usually used. Mathml does not work in all browsers, which makes it difficult to use this language as a language of the presentation of mathematical documents. For this submission of theamathetic documents of P.O. Gafurova 43 Fig. 1. The scheme of the semantic presentation of the digital collection document in the web uses Mathjax - a language that does not support the semantics, but is reproduced by all modern browsers. For a semantic description of the digital mathematical collection, we proposed a language based on XML (see, for example, [9]). This language has the following structure: each book is described by tag <bok> and contains: metadata (tags <Author>, <title>, <sayar>, <publisher>), as well as the content tag. This tag contains basic information on the book without losing the structural component of the text - paragraphs and chapters have their own strict position in the text. In paragraphs there are substantial tags for describing as mathematical structures: definition <def>, lemma <romm>, theorem <teor>, axiom <ax>, example <ex>; So not mathematical - tag <article>. Mathematical tags also have their own strict location and structure - a brief name, full text or alternative text includes in each mathematical object, also evidence is given in the case of theorems, and an alternative evidence and consequences are possible. To transmit mathematical formulas in the created presentation language, Presentation Mathml is used (see, e.g., [8], [10]). However, in connection with the problems with the display in the browsers, it was necessary to solve the problem of converting into 44 materials of the Youth School-Conference of Mathjax. To do this, an application in Python was written, which, when reading from the code file, Mathml performs the transformation into Mathjax (result in Fig. 2). This application is based on the use of a strict structure ofmathml when reformatting it in Mathjax. Rice. 2. The input data and the result of the work of the program with the next step is to create a web application in the PHP language in order to output documents of the collection on the screen and semantic search for them. The web application displays two pages-the first page of choosing a category and the term (Fig. 3). Rice. 3. A pile of selection of category and the term in the list must be selected in which category of the user wants to search, as well as drive a search query into the text field and press the button. Next, the beam occurs
