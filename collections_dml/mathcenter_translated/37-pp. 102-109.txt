Resolving the functional-differential equations of the point type considers the main initial-stringent task for a linear functional-radio-radio equation 103 (FDU) of the point type ẋ (t) = S∑ j = 1 ajx (t + nj) + ψ (t), t ∈ Br , (1) with the regional and initial conditions ẋ (t) = onic (t), t ∈ R \ Br, (2) x (t̄) = x̄, t̄ ∈ Z, x̄ ∈ Rn, (3) where aj is matrix n × n, nj ∈ Z, j = 1, s; ψ (·) ∈ Lnµ ∗ C (0) (r), С (·) ∈ ⋂+ger = 1 lnr c (0) (r), µ ∗ ∈ (0,+least); BR - either interval (M0, M1), M0, M1 ∈ Z, or half -reaches (M0, +inous), or a straight line R. Here lnµc (0) (R) is a banach space of functions x (·) with weights characterizing The smoothness of the function and the order of its growth: lnµc (0) (r) = {x (·) ∈ C (0) (r, rn): SUP Tusion ∥∥∥x (t) µ | T | ∥∥∥ rn < +urb}. For the functions ψ (·) ∈ Lnµ ∗ C (0) (r), ∗ (·) ∈ ⋂ +ger R = 1 lnr C (0) (R), µ ∗ ∈ (0, +urb) we determine the new function F (t) =    ψ (t), if t ∈ Br, onic (t), if t ∈ R \ Br. Along with the equation (1), we determine the so -called conjugated equation ˙̃x (t) = - s∑ j = 1 atj x̃ (t - nj) χbr (t - nj), t ∈ R, (4) where χbr (·) - The characteristic function of the set BR, and ATJ is a transposed matrix. 104 Theorems of the existence of a solution to both the regional problem (1)-(2), and the main initial-stringly task (1)-(3) can be formulated in the form of analogues of the theorem of F. Nechoter. The results were obtained as part of a group approach to the study of the functional-differential equations of a point type [1]. Theorem 1. For the existence of a solution to the regional problem (1) - (2) from the class lnµc (0) (r) with a given µ ∈ (0, µ ∗) ⋂ (0, 1] it is necessary that the condition +ger –ura ( f (t), x̃ (t)) rn dt = 0 was carried out for any solution X̃ (·) ∈ LN µ̄ - 1C (0) (R) of the molested equation (4) for any µ̄ <µ. The main initial-stringly task (1)-(3) from the class lnµc (0) (r) with a given µ ∈ (0, µ ∗) ⋂ (0, 1] it is necessary that the condition is +و —M (t (t (t ), x̃ (t) rn dt + (x̄, [x̃ (t̄ + 0) - x̃ (t̄ - 0)]) rn = 0 was performed for any piece of absolutely continuous solution X̃ (·) of the conjugated equation (4), which has The only rupture of the first kind at the point t̄ and satisfying the condition SUP tgr ∥∥∥x̃ (t) µ̄-| t | ∥∥∥ rn < +µ at any µ̄ <µ.

Lobachevsky, Mishan777@rambler.ru Determination of a stress-deformed state in thin-walled structures outside the stability of their elements when calculating the general strength of the vessels of the vessels classically has to consider the ship with a specific cross-section ("equivalent timber"). The outer loads are built on the outer loads. The “equivalent timber” includes all the ties of the case participating in the bend (stiffness ribs and a sheathing plate), and if the voltages are large, then some elements lose stability. In construction mechanics, when calculating the case, it is believed that the plate cannot perceive more of its Eilers of stress. This is taken into account by the introduction of the so -called reduction coefficients. The problem is solved by the method of sequential approaches in which the cross -sectional area of ​​the elements is intensively reduced [1]. 106 The purpose of this work is an attempt to approach this problem in a new way. Building the final-element model of the vessel case, we can determine the intense-deformable state (linear production) by the final element by the final element. But if in the process of deformation any elements lose stability, then large deflection appears, and the task becomes significantly nonlinear (means geometric nonlinearity). If now the decision is considered in a nonlinear production, then you can take into account all these effects. The whole difficulty lies in the fact that the convergence of the decision is very bad. This is due to the fact that when a critical tension is reached in any element, the solution is branched. And in order to give it the right direction, it is necessary to bring indignation (additional small loads) to the system. The work examined simple models. This method was tested on them. In the future, it is planned to carry out a specific body of the vessel on the air pillow. L and T R A T R A 1. Davydovl.A., Matthsd.
