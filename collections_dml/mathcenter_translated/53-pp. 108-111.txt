A close method of determining the accessor parameters during the conformity display of circular polygons let the single -link area B Plan Z have a boundary consisting of n arcs ajaj+1, 1 6 j 6 n, an+1 = a1, each of which is an arc of a circumference or straightforward L. Yu yu. . Nizamieva 109 segment. The values ​​of the internal in relation to the area B of the angles at points aj are denoted through παj. Conformedly display the upper half -plate on the wn b. Denote through aj, j = 1 ,. . . , n, points on the hangover of the related axis, which correspond to the vertices aj, j = 1 ,. . . . . . , n. As for the conformal displays of a single circle (see, e.g., [2, chap. 3, § 2]), for display f, the equality of sf (ζ) = n∑ j = 1 [1 - α2j) is true ( ζ - tj) 2 + cj ζ - tj], (1) where sf (ζ) = f ′ ′ ′ (ζ) f ′ (ζ) - 3 2 (F ′ ′ (ζ) f ′ (ζ)) 2 - derivative of the Schwarz Functions F. The right part (1) includes unknown (accessor) parameters AJ and CJ, J = 1 ,. . . , n, an important task is their definition. The numerical method of finding these acceas of weeds, based on the use of the Levner-Kufarev equation, was proposed in the works of Yu. V. Chistyakov and B. G. Baibarin (see, e.g., [1, chap. VI, § 3]). We offer a close method based on the use of Hilbert's regional tasks with a piece of curve-pole of ficentes and the study of variations of their solutions. As an auxiliary task, we consider the task of describing a single -play of a rammetric family of conformal displays of the upper half -fluidity of F (ζ, t), where T is the material parameter. With a fixed T, the function f (ζ, t) conformally displays a unity circle to the area, which is obtained from the plane about the cutting of the cut along the piece of curve, which is the unification of the beam with the top at point A1, arcs Ajaj+1, 1 6 J 6 K - 1, and parts of the arc Akak+1. With an increase of T, an increase in the incision occurs, the end of which is a′k+1 - 110 l.Yu. Nizamiev along the AKAK+1 arc from the point AK to the point AK+1. We denote the cut and t2k+2 - J coordinates of points on the border of the half -plane - prototypes of two points lying on the opposite cutting of the cut and the corresponding vertex AJ. Let TK+1 also - a point corresponding to the end of the cut. Without limiting community, it can be assumed that T1 = −1, T2 = 1, and an infinitely removed point when displayed f (ζ, t) corresponds to a selflessly deleted one. With these assumptions, the function f (ζ, t): sf (ζ) = 2k + 1∑ j = 1 [1- α2j) (ζ - tj) 2 + cj is fair ζ - tj], (2) where α2k + 2–j = 2 - αj, k + 2 6 j 6 2k + 1, αk + 1 = 2, and CJ are some constants. We have shown that SF (ζ) satisfies the differential equation ṡf (ζ, t) = r (ζ, t) s ′ f (ζ, t) + 2r ′ (ζ, t) sf (ζ, t) + r ′ ′ ′ (Ζ, t), (3) where r (ζ, t) = ζ2 - 1 ζ - tk+1 (t). Using (3), a system of differential equations was displayed to determine the accessor parameters B (2): ċj = t2k+1 - 1 (tj - tk+1) 3+cj · t2j - 2tjtk+1+1 (tj - tk+1 ) 2, j 6 = k+1, ṫj = - t2j - 1 tj - tk+1, j 6 = k+1, ˙ck+1 = ck+1 - (t2k+1 - 1) 2k+1∑ j = 1, j 6 = k+1 [α2j - 1 (tk+1 - tj) 3 - cj (tk+1 - tj) 2], ˙tk+1 = (t 2 k+1 - 1) ck+1 - 2TK+1.
