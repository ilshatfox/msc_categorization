Dissipative extensions of the integral operator V.M. Brooke1 1 vladislavbruk@mail.ru; Saratov State Technical University named after Yu.A. Gagarin in the article considers an integral equation with an operator measure. For this equation, the Lagrange formula is established, taking into account the presence of single -point atoms in an operator. Using the boundary values, a description of dissipative extensions of the minimum symmetric operator generated by this equation is given. Keywords: integral equation, operator measure, a guilbert space, a symmetrical operator, a boundary task. Let H - a sepaable calbert space with the norm ∥ · ∥ and a scalar work (·, ·). Consider the function ∆ 7 → p (∆), determined on the Borelev sets ∆ ⊂ [a, b] and taking values ​​in many limited linear operators acting in h. Function P is called the operator measure on [a, b] (see, for example, [1], chap. 5, p. 324) if P is equal to zero on an empty set and for any non -overeating Borel sets ∆n is true P (⋃ ⋃ ⋃ ⋃ ⋃ ⋃ ⋃ ⋃ ⋃ ⋃ Φ n = 1∆n) = ∑icle = 1 p (∆n) with a slightly converging nearby. Further, all IR Ru P, determined on the Borelev sets ∆⊂ [a, b], continue on a certain segment [a, b0] ⊃ [a, b0) ⊃ [a, b], believing p (∆) = 0 for all Borelevsky sets ∆⊂ [a, b0] \ [a, b]. We denote the bilate (p) = ρ (∆) = SUP ∑ i ∥P (∆I) ∥, where SUP applies to the final sums of non -overeating Borel sets ∆I ⊂∆. The number of bilan (p) is called variation of measures P on the Borelevsky set ∆. Let the measure P have limited variation on [a, b]. Then, for the ρ-mail of all ban [a, b] there is such an operator function lection → ψ (lection) with values ​​in many linear limited operators in h, ∥∥ (ă) ∥ = 1, which is for any Borelevsky set ∆⊂ [ a, b] equality p (∆) = ∆ ψ (₽) dρ is true. This integral converges in the sense of the usual norm of the opera of the radators, and the function ψ is determined unambiguously with the accuracy of the values ​​of the many zero ρ-somers ([1], chap. 5, p. 325). The symbol ´ t t0 denotes ´ [t0, t) if t0 <t; - ´ [t, t0), if t0> t; and 0, if t0 = t. Function H is integrated as it is p to many ∆, if there is an integral (in the sense of Bochner) ´ ∆ ψ (t) h (t) dρ = ´ ∆ (dp) h (t). Suppose that the function H is integrated as it is p to [a, b0]. Then the function y (t) = ´ t t0 (dp) h (s) is continuous on the left in a strong sense (t0, t ∈ [a, b0]). Further, SP denotes many single -point atoms of the measure P (i.e., many of these t ∈ [a, b] that p ({t}) ̸ = 0). A lot of SP is nothing more than counting. In the next theorem, the J - linen operator in H with the properties: j = j ∗, j 2 = e (e - identical operator); P1, P2, Q - operator measures that have limited variation for [A, B], taking values ​​in many linear limited operators acting in H, and measure Q self -combined, i.e. q ∗ (∆) = q (∆) for any Borelevsky set ∆. It is assumed that measures P1, P2, Q are continued on the segment [A, B0] ⊃ [A, B0) ⊃ [A, B] described above. 76 Materials of the International School-Conference of Theorem 1. Let F, G-integrated on [a, b0] as Q function; y0, z0 ∈ H. Then for any functions y, z type y (t) = y0 - i j ˆ t t0 dp1 (s) - i j ˆ t0 dq (s) f (s), z (t) = z0 - I j ˆ t t0 dp2 (s) z (s) - i j ˆ t0 dq (s) g (s), a é t0 <b0, t0 é t é b0, fair formula (analogue of the Lagrange formula) ˆ c2 c1 (dq (t) f (t), z (t)) - ˆ c2 c1 (y (t), dq (t) g (t)) = (i j y (c2), z (c2)) - ( I j y (c1), z (c1)) + + ˆ c2 c1 (y (t), dp2 (t) z (t)) - ˆ c2 c1 (dp1 (t) y (t), z (t) ) - ∑ ∑ tgrp1∩sp2∩ [c1, c2) (i jp1 ({t}) y (t), p2 ({t}) z (t)) - - ∑ t Photsq∩sp2∩ [c1, C2) (i jq ({t}) f (t), p2 ({t}) z (t)) - ∑ tgrp1∩sq∩ [c1, c2) (i jp1 ({t}) y (t {t}) ), q ({t}) g (t)) - ∑ tgr∩ [c1, c2) (i jq ({t}) f (t), q ({t}) g (t)), t0 é c1 é c2 é b0. Let the segment [l1, l2] ⊂ [a, b0]. Consider many functions measurable in bore with values ​​in H, limited to [l1, l2], continuous on the left on (l1, l2] (in the strong sense) and permanent on [l1, l2] ∩ (b, b0]. We determine the norm equality ∥u∥ [l1, l2] = sup t Photo [l1, l2] ∥u (t) ∥. The resulting banach space we denote C̃ [l1, l2]. Ras. We look at the equation y (t) = ˆ t0 dp (₽) y (₽)+ g (t), a é t0 é b0, (1) where the measure P has a limited variation on [a, b] (as above, we believe P (∆) = 0 for all Borelev sets ∆⊂ ( b, b0]). Theorem 2. For any fueling g ∈C̃ [a, b0] there is the only solution to the equalization (1) belonging to the space C̃ [t0 - ower, b0], where Δ = δ (t0)> 0 is not enough enough , if t0> a, and δ = 0 with t0 = a. Investigation 1. Let t0 = a. Then for any function g ∈ C̃ [a, b0] the equation (1) is the only solution belonging to the space C̃ [a, b0]. The next equation ys (t) = c + ˆ t s dp (τ) ys (τ), c ∈ H, (2) is a particular case of equation (1) for G (t) = c. through U (t, s) we denote the operator that puts in Two of each element C ∈ H The value of the solution ys (t) equations (2). Function T → U (T, S) C is a solution to the equation U (t, s) C = C +´ T S DP (τ) U (τ, S) C. Theorem 3. Let p, q - measures with limited variation.
