It is known [1] that the space S ′+ (r) of generalized functions on R with carriers in R+: = [0; ∞], equipped with a package operation, is a group of algebra with a unit of dirac. Let F - the converting of the Fourier into S ′ (R), based on the formula (firon) (perf): = ∫ r e2πi xă peace (x) d x, ∀ accord (r): 〈f (t), onic〉: = = = 〈T, firon〉, ∀t ∈S ′ (r), ∀ accord (r). In the adherent algebra s ′+(r) there is a multiplier subpulgebra M+(r): = {y (t) f (t), ∀ f (t) ∈M (r)}, where m (r) is a slow growth space On r, y (t) - the function of Hevisade. At the same time, M+(R) is a multiplier Zagalgubra with a unit - the function of Hevisade. Let v ′+(r) - multiplier Algebra V.S. Vladimirov generalized functions on R, which are boundary values ​​(in the sense of generalized functions S ′ (R)) of functions, analytical in IM Z> 0 [2]. The family a +c (r): = f [m +(r)] is a buckthorn subsidiary in Algebra V.S. Vladimirova v ′+(r) with the unit Δ+(x) = 1 2 Δ - 1 2πi V.P. 1 x, ∀x ∈R. In the algebra v ′+(r) a generalized function u+∈ V ′+(r) is searched for a successive-multable equation: t+∗ {h+· u+} = w+, ∀w+∈ ′+C (r), (1) 300 Materials of the School-Conference where T + is a given generalized function from A ′ + C (R), A H +-a given generalized function from V ′ + (R). If the solution to the problem (1) exists, then it is the only one in V ′+(R). The task (1) is reduced to the two tasks - the task T + ∗ v + = w +, (2) where t + and w + is the specified generalized functions from a ′ + c (r), v + - the desired generalized function from a ′ +C (R); and the task h+ u+ = v+, (3) where h+ is a given generalized function from v ′+ (r), v+ is found from the task (2), u+ is searched in v ′+ (r). Equation (2) is an equation of a bundle in a adhesive algebra a ′+C (R). Equation (3) is the task of dividing in Algebra V.S. Vladimirov v ′+(r). If E+ is an elementary solution of the equation (2), i.e. E+is a solution to equia t+∗ e+= Δ+, then it is the only in A ′+C (R). Therefore, equation (2) has the only solution in A ′ +C (R): V += E +∗ W +. If h+ belongs to the multiplier subgroup Y+ from algebra v ′+ (r), then the equation (3) has the only solution in v ′+ (r), which has the form: u+ = (h+) −1 v+ ∈ V ′ +(R). Then the solution to the original problem (1) has the form: u+ = (h+) −1 {e+ ∗ w+}. Literature 1. Vladimirov V.S., Zharinov V.V. Equations of mathematical physics. - M.: Fizatlit, 2004 .-- 400 c. 2.
