Key words: dual smell hypothesis, critical points, critical values ​​of polynomes. In 1981, the SMIL [1] put forward the next hypothesis. Let F - Polin, Deg F ≥ 2, such that f (0) = 0 and f ′ (0) = 1. Denote s (f) = min {∣∣∣∣ f (ζ) ζ ∣∣∣∣: f ′ (Ζ) = 0}, KN = SUP {S (F): Deg F = N, F (0) = 0, F ′ (0) = 1}. The hypothesis claims that KN = 1–1/N. The following inequalities have been proven: 1- 1 n ≤ KN <4. There are a large number of assessments for various particular cases. Some of them can be found in the article [2]. The aim of this work is to study the dual chipping hypothesis. Hypothesis. Let F - Polin, Deg F ≥ 2, such that F (0) = 0 and F ′ (0) = 1. Then there is ζ - a critical point F, such that∣∣∣∣ f (ζ) ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ∣∣∣ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ∣≥ 1n. Tishler [3] proved that the hypothesis is true for such polynomas that f (ζ) ζ = const.
