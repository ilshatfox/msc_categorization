) Asymptotic behavior of the decisions of the different indignant equation of Voltaire considered the linear variable equation of Voltairer xn = n∑ k = 0 ankxk + fn (n = 0, 1, ...) (1) 178 and the indignant equation yn = n∑ k = 0 Ankyk + n∑ k = 0 ankg (k, yk) + fn, n = 0, 1, ..., (2) where g (k, yk) = 0 at 0 ≤ k ≤ n, n - non -negative number . If {rnk}: rnk = ank + n∑ l = k rnlalk (0 ≤ k ≤ n), the nucleus resolvent {ank}, then the solution {yn} equations (2) for n ≥ n + 1 will satisfy the equation of the form yn = xn + n∑ k = n + 1 rnkg (k, yk), (3) where {xn} - solution (1). With p, q ∈ (1, φ), such that p + q = pq is valid the following theorem. Let the nucleus {ank} asymptotically stable. Let, further, | g (k, u) | ≤ w (k, | u |), where k ∈ N∪ {0}, u ∈ R, and the function W is such that W (n, t) ≤ w (n, s), where n ∈ N∪ {0 }, t ≥ 0, s ≥ 0 and t ≤ s. Suppose that with s ≥ 0 ger∑ k = 0 wq (k, s) <mm. Then, if n ≥ 0 is an arbitrary integer, {xn} - solution (1), and yn is a limited solution (3) determined by n ≥ n + 1, then lim n → و (xn - yn) = 0.
