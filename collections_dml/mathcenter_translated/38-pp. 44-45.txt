The task of Riemann on the endless surface, let Rimanov be the surface of the genus Infinity, on which there is a holomorphic function Z, taking each value in a complex plane from P once I. a. Bikchataev 45 (taking into account the multiplicity). Then the display Z: R ----> C determines the permanent unlimited covering (R, Z) plane C with an infinite number of branches of branching, the projection of which do not have in maximum points. Consider the regional task of Riemann in the next post. KE. Find a piece-matororphic function F on R with a line of jumps of G, a multiple of the 1/ D divisor and limited in the surrendously style of the ideal boundary of the surface R, the limit values ​​of which on g belong to the class nµ, l (g, t), about <µ <1 -1 <l <o, and satisfy the ratio p + (t) = g (t) f- (t) + g (t), t er (1) proved theorem. Empty d - about.11AST on R with compactM until they are fulfilled. Then D. Iets. I tilts the day, some of the top of the 10th, which is horsefly, and Lyuba. D, prov, Imaging, I am in the OD? LUU TU: TO'Ch. Superu D. Using this theorem, the regional task of Riemann (1) on the open surface R is reduced to the task of the Riemann on whom the packet riman surface. Thanks to this, the conditions for resolving were obtained and a clear solution to this problem has been given.
