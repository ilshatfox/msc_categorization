.  DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION AND PARALLEL SOLUTION OF FREE BOUNDARY PROBLEMS 1  A. Lapin Kazan State University  A finite-dimensional inclusion with M -matrices and several diagonal maximal monotone operators is studied. This problem can be viewed as a mesh scheme for a free boundary problem.  The article consists of three sections. In the first one the existence of a unique solution for the problem is proved as well as the  1This work was supported by RFBR, projects 01-01-00068, 01-01-00070  91    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  convergence and the rate of the convergence for a class of the iterative methods are studied.  In the second and third sections the applications of the general results to the industrial problems are considered. Parallel iterative methods are constructed on the basis of the domain decomposition and the alternative Schwarz-type methods.  A bibliographical survey is included in every section.  1 Inclusions with m-matrices  and diagonal monotone operators  A finite-dimensional problem  Au+Bγ + δ = f ; γ ∈ Cu, δ ∈ Du, (1.1)  with M -matricies A,B and diagonal maximal monotone (multivalued) operators C, D is studied. The existence and the uniqueness of a solution for this problem is proved. Convergence, as well as geometric (or, linear) rate of convergence, is proved for several classes of iterative algorithms under some additional assumptions imposed to input data. Application to a mesh scheme for a model free boundary problem is considered.  Mesh approximations of free and moving boundary problems with several unknown boundaries lead to (1.1), where A and B correspond to the mesh approximations (finite difference or finite element) of the partial differential operators while multivalued operators C and D can be responsible for the constraints and nonlinear relations between the components of a solution (u, γ, δ) of the problem.  We can cite the following partial cases of problem (1.1): (i) B = 0 and δ is the subdifferential of the indicator function (or,  normal cone) of a closed convex subset K ⊂ RN . This is well-known finite-dimensional variational inequality  u ∈ K : (Au, v − u) ≥ (f, v − u) ∀v ∈ K,  (u, v) = N∑ i=1  uivi. The mesh schemes for the obstacle and two-side ob stacle problems, dam problem after Baiocchi transformation, implicit  92    A. Lapin  mesh schemes at fixed time level for one-phase Stefan problem are the examples of this variational inequality. Schwarz alternating methods for the variational inequalities have been studied in [26], [28], [29], [30], [31], [39], [40], [51], [52], [50], [12] for linear A and in [8], [30] for nonlinear M -mapping A.  (ii) ci and di are the continuous functions for all i ∈ RN , A is the identity matrix. Now, problem (1.1) includes, for example, a mesh approximation of the classical two-phase Stefan problem at a fixed time level, when B corresponds to a mesh approximation of Laplace operator, u stands for the mesh enthalpy function while γ for the temperature. Various parallel iterative methods based on the multisplittings of the matrix pair (A,B) have been considered in [6], [7], [48], [49] for this kind of problem (1.1). In [6] the geometric convergence of a class of asynchronous iterative methods for the system of nonlinear algebraic equations has been proved.  (iii) ci and di are the continuous functions, A and B are M matrices. Problem (1.1) can correspond to an implicit in time mesh scheme for the steel continuous casting problem with nonlinear boundary flux, which is a particular case of the Stefan problem with prescribed convection. The additive and multiplicative Schwarz iterative algorithms for this problem have been investigated in [34], [35]. A mesh scheme for the general Stefan problem with prescribed convection and linear boundary conditions has the form (1.1) with multivalued maximal monotone graph γi and D = 0. The article [31] deals with the algebraic problem, including such kind of the mesh scheme.  In [31] the existence of a unique solution and the convergence of a multisplitting method has been investigated for the problem with severalM -matrices and diagonal multivalued operators. Some results on the geometrical convergence of the iterative methods for problem (1.1) can be found in [33].  1.1 Existence and uniqueness of the solution.  Comparison theorem  Let for problem (1.1) the following assumptions be fulfilled:  A,B are M -matrices, (1.2)  C,D are diagonal maximal monotone operators, (1.3)  93    Domain decomposition and parallel solution. . .  i. e., for example, Cu = diag(c1(u1), . . . , cN (uN ))). Let also there exist a subsolution (u, γ, δ), γ ∈ Cu, δ ∈ Du and a supersolution (ū, γ̄, δ̄), γ̄ ∈ Cū, δ̄ ∈ Dū of problem (1.1):  (u, γ, δ)¿ (u, γ̄, δ̄), Au+Bγ + δ ¿ f ¿ Aū+Bγ̄ + δ̄, (1.4) where uÀ 0 means the componentwise inequality.  Further we suppose that the operators C and D are bounded and dom(C) = dom(D) = RN (see [31] for the details about the modification of the unbounded operators ou
