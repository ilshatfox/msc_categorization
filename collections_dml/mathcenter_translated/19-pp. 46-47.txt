) A description of the space conjugated to the inductive limits of the calbert spaces of sequences constructive description of the transformation of Fury-lapas Elea:. 11 spaces with different topologies plays an important role in solving the problems of complex analysis (from ~ 1., E.g., [1]). In a given work, the study of the generalized transformation of Fourier Laplace of the Hilbertâ€™s elements of the sequentials allows us to describe the space conjugated to the inductive limit of the sequence of such spaces.
