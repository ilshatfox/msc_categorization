One of the main binding theory of differentiation of Integra Clete with differential bases is forailized by the Sch'duyuyu-" R image. Let x, y - two different in some sense of space. Is there a differential basis that differentiates all integrals from function from x, but the function is from U, integra; 1 from which this basis is not differentculates? The cut .'itats related to this sampling belong to Hayes [1, p. 155], A. Stokolos, E. Litro [Z].
