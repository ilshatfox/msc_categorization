Convection with large puppies Schmidt O.A. Frolovskaya Institute? .UDrodynamics named after M.A. Lavrentieva SB RAS, Novosibirsk E-mail: Oksana@h ydro. NSC. Ru considers the task of the mass exchange and free convection knitting fluid near the vertical wall (substrate). To describe free convection, the classic model of the overtecema is used-the boussinez and the microconviation model [1]. For both models, under large numbers of Schmidt (rendt. ~ I), a previously not icshawed special diffusion-dynamic border layer is allocated [2). Outside of the diphusion-dynamic border layer, the structure of Ryul soon the steady depends on the number of Reynolds. If it is large, then in the area of ​​movement there is also a purely dynamic with, the 1st with a larger asymptothy thickness, which was smalled on the inner border with a diffusion on -dynamic layer, and on the outer - with a state of rest. On the OS NOVA Auto -modified decisions, formulas for Nussel numbers (local and general) are obtained depending on the numbers of Reynolds, Lllmidt and the Bussinski parameter in the establishment mode and in small times. Unspopationalized border layers are considered. It is shown that in the dignified layer there is an anti -flow zone. Literature 1. Pukhnachev c. AT . JV!
