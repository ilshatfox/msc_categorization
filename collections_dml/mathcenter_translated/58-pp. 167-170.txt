Salakhov1 1 ramms_92@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University solved the problem of the movement of polydisperse aerosol with evaporating drops in the velocity field of the Kaplan vortex: a model of an inkjet vortex flow. Eulers are implemented the method of moments for the logarithmically normal function of the distribution of particles over surface areas. For various numbers of Stox, the characteristics of the evaporating liquid phase are calculated. Keywords: the method of moments, evaporation, inertial drops, polydis -prayer aerosol Mathematical modeling of gas stations with evaporating drops is necessary to predict processes in internal combustion engines or when droplets of medicinal aerosols in the respiratory tract. A review of the evaporation models of single drops is given in the work [1, 2]. Evalizing drops in such tasks are a polydispersed system. For modeling the dynamics of polydisperse drops, Lagranzhev is used a method for calculating the trajectories of individual particles and eulers Method for solving the transfer equation for the dispersed phase [2]. Recently, Eulerov methods of moments have been actively developing [3, 4]. Formulation of the problem. Consider an axial-symmetric vortex flow of gas in the cylindrical system of the coordinate Fig. 1. The vortex ring spreads along the Z axis (symmetry axis), at the initial point in time it is assumed that the vortex ring is limited by the plane Z, R0 - the initial radius of the vortex ring (Fig. 1). Rice. 1. The scheme of the vortex ring of Kaplan [5, 6] the analytical model of the field of the course of the vortex ring is proposed in the work of Kaplan [6]. Enter the dimensionless parameters: R (D) = R ∗ (D) R0, V (D) = R0 γ0 V ∗, T = γ0 R20 T ∗; 168 “Lobachev readings - 2019” where R = (R, Z), V = (U, V), γ0 is the initial circulation of the vortex ring. Expressions for the flow function ψ according to [6] are recorded in the form ψ = −r p Re 4 p 2t ∫ φ 0 f (x, p re z - zvcp 2t) J1 (p re x 2t) J1 (p r xp 2t) where J1- The function of the first-kind Bessel. The behavior of the particle system, taking into account the axial symmetry in the two -dimensional physical space, is described by the function of distribution density F (t, x, y, a, v1, v2), where a is the area of ​​the particle surface. The dynamics of the distribution function is described by the kinetic equation of Bolzman-Villams: ∂ f ∂t + ∂ (v1 f) ∂x + ∂ (v2 f) ∂y + ∂ (r f) ∂a + ∂a1 f v1 + ∂a2 f V2 = 0 (1) where R is the law of evaporation, A1 and A2 - the law of the aerodynamic resistance of Stox. Consider the logarithmic-normal function of the distribution density F (t, a) at some point (x, y) f (a) = m0 2 p 2πa lnσg exp (-LN2 (A/AG) 8LN2σG) where AG is the average geometric area of ​​the surface, σ is a standard geometric deviation. Multiplying (1) by size A and integrating, we get the equations of the transfer of the moments: ∂m0 ∂t + ∂ (vx m0) ∂x + ∂ (vy m0) ∂y = rn (s = 0), ∂m1 ∂t + ∂ ( vx m1) ∂x + ∂ (vy m1) ∂y = —rm0, ∂m2 ∂t + ∂ (vx m2) ∂x + ∂ (vy m2) ∂y = −2rm1. (2) where is mi (t) = ∫ φ 0 a i f (a, t) d a. We introduce the designation of the amount of the particle system: mx = vx m1, my = vy m1 by multiplying (1) by size A and the speed components V1 and V2, and integrating, we get the equations of the transfer of pulses MX, My. ∂mx ∂t + ∂ (vx mx) ∂x + ∂ (vy mx) ∂y = m1ug −MX ST —RM0VX, ∂MY ∂T + ∂ (vx my) ∂x + ∂ (vy my) ∂y = m1vgg −My ST −RM0VY, (3) r.R. Salakhov 169 System of equations (2) (3) was solved in numerically using the TVD circuit with the minmod limiter function. Figure 2 presents the distributions of the concentration of inertial particles at a time of time, starting from the rectangular region without taking into account and taking into account the evaporation of drops. At the initial point in time, the speed of drops is zero. It can be seen that for inertial particles, the region expands compared to the vortex area. Accounting for evaporation reduces the influence of inertia on the movement of particles. Rice. 2.
