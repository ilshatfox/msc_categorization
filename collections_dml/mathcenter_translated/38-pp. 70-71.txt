Interpolation of positive bilinear operators in orderly interpolation pair x = (Ho, X1) of NZO a pair of banana spaces (Ho, X1) with generating closed cones XT, XI, algebraically and topologists of the Topological vector of W+ 'closed cone, which are invested in a detachment. x+ i with w+ (i = o, 1). Through l (x) = xonx1, we denote the intersection, through: e (x) = Ho+ x1 - the sum of the spaces of the banach pair H. Let it now x = (HO, x1), y = (UO, U1), z = (zo, Z1) Order Interpolation couples. with cones x/ ~+, zi+ (i = o, 1), respectively. Bilinean operator in: e (x) x e (y) ---> e (z) will be positive if in: XI+ x ~+-> zi+ (i = o, 1) and there are constants cj> o, such that l! b (x, y) l \ z; ~ Cellxllx; llylly, for any x e x;, u e yi (i = o, 1). We denote many of these operators via+(e (x) x e (y), e (z)). A set of spaces (x, y, x, y) will call interpolation for positive bilinear operators relative (z, z) if any operator in+(e (x) x e (y), e (z) ) translates x x U to Z and there is a constant C> o, such that LLB (x, y)) lz <callxllxlly llv for any x e x, ue. Here is one method for constructing the sets interpolation for laidj1, bilinear operators. For banahu space x through E (x, x+), we denote the linear for l. V. Veselova 71 space in X, generated by cone x+, with the norm LLX: IE (x, x+) = Inf {\ lx'lix "llx" llx: x ', x "e x+, x1 - x" }. Let x s e (x), y (y), z s with e (z) with closed to Nusy x+ with xt+ x: 1 y+ with UO++ yl+, z+ with zt+ z: respectively and the set (x, y, x, y) is interpolation for BI linear operators regarding the set (Z, Z). Theorem. If any operator in+(e (x) x e (y),: e (z)) translates x+ x y+ into z+, then a set of spaces (x, y, x, y) interpopol. Koni Ches! <Ooo intersections D (x) = E (HO NX1, XII NX; :), introduced into [1], interpolarly for the positive bilinear operates of the radators. There is also an example that shows that this space is not interpolation for all bilinear Ope Ratorov. Literature 1. Veselova L. in "Sukochev F. A" Tikhonov O. E.
