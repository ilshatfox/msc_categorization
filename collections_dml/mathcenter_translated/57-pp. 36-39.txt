Extreme sets in a complex plane: compacts of Chebotarev, Stal and Natla A.I. Apteksarev Classical problem of Chebotarev is a compact of the minimum logarithmic capacity containing the final number of specified points on the complex plane. We discuss modern applications and generalizations of this problem, such as the structure of the sheets of the Riman surface of the analytical vector function and asymptotics of the rational approximants of the Hermita Pad. Keywords: the problem of Chebotarev, logarithmic capacity, Rimannaya surface, rational approximant of the Hermita Pad. UDC 517.98 O spectral properties of one triple model operator G.P. Arzikulov1, Yu.Kh. Eshkabilov2 1 arzikulov79@mail.ru; Tashkent State Polytechnic University named after Islam Karimov 2 yusup62@mail.ru; Karshin State University has been investigated the structure of a significant spectrum of one three -bowel model operator h. The description is given to the essential spectrum of the operator h. The parties of the negative values ​​of the operator H was proved and an assessment has been obtained for the number of negative own values. Keywords: a significant spectrum, discrete spectrum, lower line of a significant spectrum, a triple discrete operator. The work [1] shows a model operator in the theory of discrete Schrödinger operators, which arise in the theory of three -partial quantum systems. Let ω1 ⊂RD1, (d1 ∈N) andω2 ⊂RD2, (d2 ∈N) - compact sets. We denote through H0 the multiplication operator by the function K0 (X, Y), i.e. (H0 f) (x, y) = k0 (x, y) f (x, y), where k0 (x, y) is an arbitrary material continuous function on ω1 × ω2. Consider the continuous functions of K1 (x, s, y) onω21 × ω2 and k2 (x, t, y) onω1 × ω22. Suppose that k1 (x, s, y) = k1 (s, x, y), k2 (x, t, y) = k2 (x, y, t). In the calbert space L2 (ω1 × ω2), we determine the linear limited self -combined operator h = h0 - (t1 +t2), (1) here the actions of operators T1 and T2 are set according to the formulas of G.P. Arzikulov, Yu.Kh. Eshkabilov 37 t1 f (x, y) = ∫ ω1 k1 (x, s, y) f (s, y) dµ1 (s), t2 f (x, y) = ∫ ω2 k2 (x, t, y) f (x, t) dµ2 (t). Integration is understood in the sense of the leader as it is µ j (·) on ω j, j = 1.2. In the future, we will assume that D S = Dµ1 (S), D T = Dµ2 (T) and µ1 (ω1) = µ2 (ω2) = 1. Sometimes the operators of the type (1) are partially called integral operators (chio) of the Fredgolm type. The monograph is devoted to the study of various properties of the Frelholm type [2]. In [3], the spectral properties of self -integrated chio type Fredgolm are investigated. In [1], a spectrum of one three -part discrete operator H T, which occurs in the Hubbard model, was investigated. The impulse representation of the discrete operator H T sells a self -combined operator of the type (1). Significant and discrete spectra of some three-layer operators specified (1) are investigated, for example, in work [4-7]. In [4], sufficient conditions of the limb and infinity of the discrete spectrum in the model (1) were obtained, when k1 (x, s, y) = const, k2 (x, t, y) = const and σess (h) = σ (h) = σ (h) H0). In [5], the existence of an infinite number of negative own values ​​in the model is proved (1). In the works [6.7], a significant spectrum and the number of own values ​​that lie below the lower face of the essential spectrum in the model (1) are investigated, when the function K0 (X, Y) has a special type: K0 (X, Y) = U (X) v (y) and nuclei K1, K2 are degenerated with one and two orders. A full description of the essential spectrum of the operator H (1) is given. The existence of one or two of the own values ​​lying below the lower edge of a significant spectrum has been proven. Let {onic (x), k = 1, n} and {ψ j (y), j = 1, m} - an orthonomated system of continuous functions from L2 (ω1) and l2 (ω2), С (y) and ψ (y) and ψ (y) and ψ ( x) - materially significant continuous functions of Navel andω1, respectively. In this work, the model operator h (1) with degenerated nuclei K1 (x, s, y), k2 (x, t, y): k1 (x, s, y) = onic (y) q1 (x, s) is considered , k2 (x, t, y) = ψ (x) q2 (y, t) here q1 (x, s) = n∑ k = 1 ak accord (x) onic (s), q2 (y, t) = ψ (x) m∑ k = 1 bkψk (y) ψk (t), where ak> 0, b j> 0. Let u (x) and v (y) - irregular continuous functions on ω1 and ω2, respectively and 0 ∈ Ran (u), 0 ∈ Ran (v), while u (xmin) = 0, xmin ∈ ω1 and v (ymin) = 0, ymin ∈rap, and let the functions onic (y), ψ (x) are also non -negative and ∗ (ymin) = ∗ = max y ]2 onic (y), ψ (xmin) = ψmax = max xicle1 ψ (x). Consider Chio H, set by equality H = h0-(t1 +t2), (2) 38 Materials of the School-Conference in space L2 (ω1 × ω2), where h0 f (x, y) = u (x) v (y) f (x, y). Through ρ (·), σ (·), σess (·) and σdi SC (·), as usual, a resolve -spectrum, a significant spectrum and a discrete spectrum of self -integrated operators are denoted [8]. Work [6] is devoted to the study of significant and discrete spectrum of Chio H (2) with degenerated nuclei K1 (X, S, Y) and K2 (X, T, Y). Section 3 gives a full description of the essential spectrum of the OPE
