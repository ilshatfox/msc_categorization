) The Hardi-Littlwood theorem and Palei inequality for the rows of Furye-Haara is well known for the Hardi-Littlewood theorem [1] for trigonometric rows. Let 1 <p <mm, f ∼ φ∑ k = 0 ak cos kx. If {ak} gerk = 0 is a monotonously non -growing sequence, then in order to f ∈ LP [0, π], it is necessary and enough to ensure that a row φ∑ k = 0 kp -2APK converges. (1) there is [2] an analogue of this theorem for monotonous functions. If F is monotonous and f ∼ φ∑ k = 0 ak cos kx, then in order to f ∈ LP [0, π], it is necessary and enough for a row (1) to converge. As can be seen from these results, the conditions for belonging to the LP space for monotonous functions and functions with monotonous coefficients coincide - this is the convergence of a series (1). For the rows according to the Haara system, there is a different situation. P. L. Ulyanov in the work [3] proved that if the factors of Furye-haara {ck} are monotonous, then in order for the function F to belong to 24 LP space [0, 1] with 1 <p <aged, it is necessary that { ck} φk = 1 ∈ L2, i.e. To converge a row φ∑ k = 1 | ck | 2. Theorem 1. Let {χK} inous = 1 - Haara system, 1 <p <mm, f ∼ و imes k = 1 ckχk. If f (x) is a monotonous function, then in order to f ∈ LPQ, it is necessary and enough for a row (ughter∑ k = 0 2K (1 2– 1P) Q (SUP 2K≤ν <2k+1 | cν ​​|) Q) 1/Q. The next theorem establishes inequalities, which are analogues of Palei inequalities [1]. Theorem 2. Let {χk (x)} φk = 1 - Haara system, f ∼ ger k = 1 ckχk (x), ϑ = {ϑk} =    1 2k/2k-1∑ ν = 2k −1 ca    φ k = 1, u = {uk} = {2k/2 max 2k - 1≤ν <2k | cν ​​| } Inous k = 1. a) If 1 <p <2, p ′ = p/(p - 1) and f ∈ LP [0, 1], then the inequality ϑϑϑϑq ≤ c‖f‖f‖lpq [0,1] is true. b) if p> 2, u ∈ LP′Q, then f ∈ LPQ [0, 1] and the inequality ‖f‖lpq [0.1] ≤ c‖u‖lp′q is true.
