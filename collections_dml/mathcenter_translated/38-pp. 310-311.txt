The isoperimeterism of the regions and their connection with the variational inequalities of mathematical physics in this work use the concepts of isperimetric profile B (t) and characterizing it in constant, entered in. M. Mialikov and M. K. Vuorainen in [1). On the plane, areas of the species F2 = {(x, y) E R2! X E IR are considered; U E (o, 2a)}, where a = const <oo, with metric ds 2 = (1/b (x, y) + c) 2 (dx2 + + dy2), b (x, y) - distance to Borders. Following [2) and [3), we and. K. Shafigullin 311 We consider inequalities such as hardy, containing two for integral terms. For such areas, the inequality of the species is considered [i2 (x) [i2 (x) 2 [2 jn ip (x, y) dx + 2s jn b (x, y) dx + s jn and (x) dx :( :( L2 1 IU'i (x) \ 2DX, and E WD'2 (sch.
