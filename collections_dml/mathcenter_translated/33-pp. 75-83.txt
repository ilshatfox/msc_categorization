Modeling the flow of fluid to a horizontal well in a fissitive-porist layer A. I. Abdullin, P.E. Morozov Institute of Mechanics and Engineering of the Executioners of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Kazan 1 Setting a task for calculating hydrodynamic characteristics and operating modes of horizontal wells (GS) in porous media Various analytical formulas are proposed [1], as well as approaches based on the numerical modeling of the flow of liquid to the HS [2 - 5]. One of the common approaches of the numerical modeling of the flow of fluid to the GS is based on the conjugation of the end -to -its -term approximation of the current in the layer and the analytical model of the course in the vicinity of the well [2]. In the work [3], a pH-adaptive method of final elements is used for modeling a GS that has an arbitrary trajectory in a layer. In this case, the well is modeled by a pipe made of porous material with great permeability (108 μm2). In the work [4], the solution of the non -stationary problem of filtering the fluid to the HS in the anisotropic layer is built by the method of boundary elements. The process of non-stationary filtering of the fluid in a fissitive-rocket layer, opened with a horizontal well (Fig. 1), is described by a system of differential equations [6, 7] with (x, y, z) ∈ V, t0 <t: β ∗ 1 ∂p1 ∂t = ∇ (k1 µ ∇p1) + α µ (p2 - p1), β ∗ 2 ∂p2 ∂t = ∇ (k2 µ ∇p2) - α µ (p2 - p1) (1.1) 75 Modeling of the fluid tributary to horizontal well. . . Rice. 1: Scheme of the formation, opened by the GS under the following initial and boundary conditions: P1 (X, Y, Z, T0) = P0 (X, Y, Z), P2 (X, Y, Z, T0) = P0 (X, Y , z); (1.2) p1 ∣∣ ∂v1 = p2 ∣∣ ∂v1 = pk, (1.3) (k1 µ ∇p1, n) ∣∣∣∣ ∂v2 = 0, (k2 µ ∇p2, n) ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ V2 = 0, P1 ∣∣ SC = P2 ∣∣ SC = PC. (1.4) here Pi, Ki, β ∗ I (i = 1, 2) - respectively, the pressure, the vanity of the bridge, the elasticity of cracks and porous blocks µ - the dynamic viscosity of the fluid; α is the parameter of the renewal characterizing the intensity of fluid metabolism between blocks and cracks; PK - layer pressure; PC - upbringing pressure; SC - the surface of the GS; ∂v = ∂v1 ∪ ∂v2 - the external boundary of the region V (Fig. 1); N is a single vector of normal. The task (1.1) - (1.4) corresponds to the case when sore pressure is set on the trunk of the HS. If the consumption is set on the GS trunk, then in this case the boundary condition is set in the form of - [(K1 µ ∇P1, N) + (K2 µ ∇P2, N)] SC = Q (X, Y, Z, T), ( 1.5) 76 A. I. Abdullin, P.E. Morozov P1 ∣∣ SC = P2 ∣∣ SC = const, where Q (X, Y, Z, T) is the influx of fluid, which is per unit surface of the trunk of the GS. The influx of Q (X, Y, Z, T) in condition (1.5) is calculated from the assumption that the pressure on the surface of the horizontal well is constantly and Q (t) = ∫ SC Q (X, Y, Z, T) DL (t) - a debt of a horizontal well. A layer opened with a horizontal well is modeled by a two -sequent area. To break the area of ​​filtration V into the elements, the Bower -Watson algorithm (Bowyer - Watson) is used [8], which is based on the sequential adding points in the partially constructed triangulation of Delona. The internal boundary of the layer is presented in the form of a cylindrical cavity that repeats the trajectory of the well. The well is divided into segments, as shown in Fig. 2, a. Based on each segment, an inscribed correct polygon is built (Fig. 2, b), the peaks of which belong to many nodes of the region. As a result of the triangulation of the entire region, the surface of the well is divided into triangles (the bases of tetrahedron adjacent to the well). To build a system of algebraic equations relatively unknown nodal values, the MKE procedure in the form of a Galerkin method is used [9]. According to this method, the unknown variable p = (p1, p2) is approximated on the element V E in the form of P1 ≈ PE1 = N∑ I = 1 PE1in E I, P2 ≈ PE2 = N∑ I = 1 PE2in E I, where PE1, P E 2 is approximation Solutions on the element, p e 1i, p e 2i are the inevitable values ​​of the function P in the nodes of the element, the nei - basic functions associated with the element V E. In a vector-impact form, the resulting line of the line 77 modeling of the flow of liquid to the horizontal well. . .

The rate of wells Q can be represented as the sum of the tributaries attributable to the nodes belonging to the surface of the well of the well: q = ∑ Isors n∑ j = 1 (k1i, jp1j + k2i, jp2j). Here S - many nodes of nodes on the surface of the well. The condition for the constancy of pressure on the surface of the well is taught in the form of an additional equation connecting the flow rate, pressure in the well (upbringing PC) and pressure in nearby nodes. This equation is obtained by summing up lines with numbers from the multiple s of the conduction matrix.
