The completeness of some systems in the spaces of analytical functions, let D, a single -bonded limited area with a single -link addition of CD to CZ, A (D) - the space of functions F (Z) regular in D, with the topology of uniform converts from D. In many tasks of the theory of functions , related to interpolation and solution of of of of the end-and-characteristic equations, the question arises of the completeness of the system of the species of the species p-1⋃ j = 0 {[wj (z)] np+lj aj (z)} و = 0, (1) where p where P. ≥ 2, p ∈ N; 0 ≤ lj ≤ p - 1; WJ (Z) - single -leaf, regular in D functions, AJ (Z) - also regular function in the field of D 13. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the completeness of the functions system (1) in space A (D) were found. Consider the particular case of the system (1) with p = 2. Let W (Z) - holomorphic and one -leaf in D function, z = z (w) - its circulation. We denote the image D through G when displayed by the W (Z) function. Let AJ (Z), j = 0, 1, - holomorphic and not having zeros in D function. Theorem 1. The system of functions {[w (z)] 2na0 (z)} φN = 0 ∪ {[w (z)] 2n+1a1 (z)} mmn = 0 is full of space A (D) then and only Then, when the function 4 (w) ≡ a0 (z (w)) a1 (z (−w)) + a0 (z (−w)) a1 (z (w)) has not a single pair of zeros, symmetrical regarding the beginning Coordinates, in the area of ​​G. Let now WJ (Z), j = 0, 1, - odd, holomorphic and single -leafful functions in the area D, symmetrical regarding the onset of coordinates. Theorem 2. The system of functions {[w0 (z)] 2na0 (z)} φN = 0 ∪ {[w1 (z)] 2n+1a1 (z)} ger = 0 is full of space A (D) then only Then, when the function 4 (z) ≡ a0 (z) a1 ( - z) + a0 ( - z) a1 (z) has no zero in the area D. 14
