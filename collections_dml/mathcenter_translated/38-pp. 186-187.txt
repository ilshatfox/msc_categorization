Functional equations generated by a group with two maximum points investigate a three -element functional equation 3 (v f) (z) = 2: j [o "j (z)] = g (z), z e d, (1) j = l with The following assumptions: 1) D - an area with a positively oriented piece of smooth border G, consisting of a set of two excavations l1 = [-l, - 1] u [1,>.] And two semicircles l2: lzl = 1 and lz: lzl = L, IM Z> O, L> 1; 2) Transformation 0 "1 (Z) = -z, 0" 2 (Z) = LZ, AZ = A;-1 are generating the transformations of the actual gap group G of fractional linear transformations with the fundamental set H = d \ (lz u [1,>.)). The group G has two pre -points z1 = O and Z2 = OS. Solution F (Z) is searched in. D and disappearing at infinity, and the boundary value of F- (t) on each open smooth component of the border G satisfies the condition of the gelder. In the angular accuracy (peaks), the most logarithmic special fraud. Free member G (Z) holomorphone in the area D, and its boundary value G + (t) satisfies the condition of the gel dera on the g. To study the equation (1), the method of equally strong regulatory is used, based on the representation of the solution in the form of an integral type. Koshi V.V.

Let p (z) e M. through p* (z) we denote the polynomial, with sp (z), that is, p* (z) = p (z). Then fair
