The task of diffraction of the elastic wave on the periodic system of defects E. A. Osipov Kazan State University, Osipove@mail.ru is considered a medium consisting of two half -fruits having the same environmental parameters and stripes with other characteristics. On the boundary of the conjugation of the strip with the lower half -fluidity of y = −h there are defects (for example, cracks or hard inclusions). It is assumed that defects are posted periodically. In a flat or two -dimensional case, when the desired values ​​by the z, the state of the elastic body describe the stress and movement, which depend on the two spatial coordinates X, Y and on time t. Dependence on the time of all the values ​​under consideration has the type of eıωt, where ω is the circular frequency of the wave vibrations. In the study of the tasks of the diffraction of elastic waves on the periods of wild defects in the layered environment, the method of a redundant boundary task of Koshi was used [1]. The force of the structure of the structure of the solution of auxiliary boundary problems in each layer of the environment was considered as a quasi -violent functions (waves of the flock) of the species f (x, y) = eiefa) n = −mber fn (y) e i 2π l nx, where L is the period . Therefore, the system of differential equations is reduced to the system of equations regarding their Fourier coefficients. For the coefficients of the decays of the signs of the llame equation, the system of differential 175 of the second -order equations of the type - (λ + 2µ) d2nuxn + ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ λ λ µ) idnu ′ yn = 0, (λ + 2µ) u was obtained ′ ′ Yn - µd2nuyn + ρω2uyn + (λ + µ) idnu ′ xn = 0. The conditions of interfaces on the boundaries of the media are led to a paired functional equation. It is shown that it is tantamount to BSRAU, for the solution of which the truncation method is used. L and T R A T R A 1. Pletshchinsky N.B.
