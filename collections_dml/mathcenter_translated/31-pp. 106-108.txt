The construction of non-flowing wing profiles by modifying the speed distribution of O. S. Neberov NIMMM of Kazan State University is still relevant as the problem of optimizing the form of classical wing profiles in the potential stream of ideal inconspicuous fluid. The work considers the task of constructing non -streamlined wing profiles, which selected the profiles of Zhukovsky and Clark’a. The essence of the task is as follows. Let there be a wing profile streamlined in a certain range of attack angles [α1, α2]. It is necessary to ensure a non -flowing stream of profile with a slightly larger angle of attack α3> α2, α3 = = α2+∆α. We call the angle α3 calculated. Having solved the direct regional task of aerohydrodynamics during the calculated angle of attack, we will make sure that the profile is stuck with the separation of the flow. To build unexceptably streamlined wing profiles, two approaches are used: a straight line that consists in changing the profile shape, and the opposite, which consists in such a modification of speed distribution along the contour of the profile, so that the aerodynamic characteristics change minimally. It was the second approach that was used below. In the process of modification, the theory of reverse edge tasks of aerohydrodynamics was used [1]; The viscosity was taken into account according to the model of the border layer, for the calculation of which the integral method of Kochin - Loitsyansky was used [2, § 112]; The stiff stir was guaranteed by the implementation of the criterion of the uncleaning of L. G. Loitsyansky. Thus, a new wing profile was built, streamlined without the separation of the flow already in a larger 106 range of attack angles [α1, α3]. In the process of solving, the introduction of a new quasi -nia, which not only satisfies the conditions for resolving the reverse task, but also allows you to get rid of the speed of speed in the posterior edge of the profile. The results of numerical calculations showed that the constructed wing profiles have aerodynamic quality, somewhat larger than the original ones. I express my gratitude to the scientific leader Professor N. B. Ilyinsky for setting the task and useful tips.

The parametric decisions of the trans -intoxic equation and their connection with the auto -modified E.O. Nemtsov Saratov State University named after N. G. Chernyshevsky, www.sgu.ru The report considers the parametric method of B. I. Zas 107 Lavsky [1], which allows to obtain accurate solutions, which are a generalization of some well -known car modeling decisions. Consider the classic trans -into the ideal gas. We assume that the flow is stationary, isnerge and isanthropic [2]. The main system of equations characterizing such currents has the form UX = VY, UY = VX. (1) A symmetrical class of solutions of Zaslavsky - Klepikova for the system (1) is known (including well -known auto -modified solutions for the automotive indicator n = 2, 5/4, 4/5). Let the senior coefficient in the view for x x2 (s) = s, where s is the parameter, i.e. we have: x = x0 (s) + SY 2, u = u0 (s) + u2 (s) y 2, v = V1 (s) y + v3 (s) y 3. (2) by substituting (2) in (1), we get a system of ordinary differential equations for coefficients B (2). From this system, one can distinguish a nonlinear core relative to the U′2 and V ′ 3. An example of it is Zaslavsky’s technology [1] the restoration of other coefficients. We consider the coefficient U2 (S). Indeed, the nonlinear core can be reduced to one equation of the 2nd order relative to the U2 (S), the private solution of which is S = BZ, U2 (S) = S2. The exact solution for (2) has the form (for the purpose of exemption from irrationalities we use the replacement Z = T3): x = bt3y2 + (−6c2b + 5c1t3 + 10c3t5)/(10t5), u = b2t6y2 + b (c1t3 - 3c2b) t - t - t - t - t - 2, v = - (2/3) y3b3t9 + (−b2t4c1 - 6tc2b3) y. (2a) here C1, C2, C3, B are constants. Along with the decision of Zaslavsky (2) there is a class of single -parametric solutions associated with n = 3 (includes well -known car model solutions 108
