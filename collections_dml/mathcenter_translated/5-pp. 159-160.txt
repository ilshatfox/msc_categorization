Numerical solutions of differential - algebraic equations system of differential -algebraic equations x = w (x, t) +c (x, t) l, f (x, t) = o, x (to) = x0, x e ~ n, is given To the system of differential equations ± = C [f: i: c] + 1: (pf -ft), x (to) = x 0, (1) where [f: i: c] is vector work. The conditions are determined on the nested on the scalar C and the matrix C, P, in order to satisfy the system of the system with the equation of the connections F (x, t) = O with a given accuracy. Theorem 1. There are such post -industrial a:, t1, s: and matz r (x, t), 'that when performing inequalities t; llt (k2) 1/ ~ 2 (1 - a :) e, f (k2) tj f j = v: i: t: i: v+ c:: i: tv+ tt, 11 =: i:, solution of the variable equation xk + l = xk + tvk, xk = x (tk). fk = f (xk, tk), tk + 1 = tk + t, satisfies the ustroot ll! kll ~ e for all k ~ 1. theorem 2. If the variable scheme 159 vk = v is used to solve equation (1) xk, tk + at), a> o, xk = xk + o: tt'k, and with all x = xk, t = tk, k = 0.1,2 ", k values ​​t, q> o, a, a, .f, p (x, t) and the residual member R (kz) b decline x = x (t) satisfies the conditions 1!/011 :::: :, 2a = 1,! \ R (kz) \\ :::: IL 1 2. 11 ~ (1 - Q) E, I/E + TRK + 2T2 ((PK)) + PK I :::; Q <1, 11 1, the inequalities l! jkli ~ e are performed for all k = 1, 2, ..., k. The proposed method of numerical solution is used to solve the problems of determining the reactions of the connections of non -free fur systems, the tasks of managing the software traffic, the tasks of robotics, machine graphics and others. A.A. Nazipov (Kazan) Multiciming the best approximation of the functions of many variables, let the table of values ​​of some function ZK, L = Z (XK, U1), K = O, P + 1, L = O, where P, t, are set N. suggested that the values ​​of the arguments are streamlined by increasing. Algebraic Pauline, with fixed y = yi, has a natural characteristic in relation to the initial tab to face - maximum deviation [1]: max 1 zkl - pnm (xk, yl) 1 · so that PNM (x, y) is KE [o: o: o: o: o: o: o: o: Nj by the polynoma of the best approximation, it is necessary and enough that with some H1 ratios are performed [1] (1) 160
