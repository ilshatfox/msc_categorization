Solving the problem of Koshi for one degenerating hyperbolic equation of N.V. Chepanov Ka ;; 1Aakh state ~ 'nedagogue university, we consider the degenerate singular hyperbolic equation d2i l (and) = ym dx2 - B11i = O, T> 1, A2 K and 8 11 = -8 2 + -d, o <k <3. {1) U u u, may D is the area limited by the segment [a, b] axis oh and character x -yv jv = a, x + YV JV = b, emerging from points A (A, O) and B (b, O) and intersecting at point C, l'DS V = {m + 2)/2. The task of Koshi: Find the solution of the equation (1) in the field of D, continuous n fj and satisfying the initial conditions of AAI \ = F (x), in 11 = 0 and (x, o) = SR (x), and ~ x ~ b .
