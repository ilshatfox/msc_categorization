) Algebrai is generated by the semi -orthonal projectors of BE - the Hilbert space above the field λ (= r or C). Through b (h) we denote the ∗-algebra of all linear limited operators in H. Operator T ∈ B (H) is called-hypothet, if t 2 = t; - the projector, if t 2 = t = t ∗; - a semi -heartonal projector [1] if t ∗ t = 1 2 (t + t ∗). (1) We denote through I, P, S of all the hypothetes, projectors and semi -illegal projectors b (h), respectively. Then ∩s = p. In [2] it is proved that each operator t ∈ B (h) is represented as a final amount t = ∑ tk, where each TK is a work of no more than two projectors at DIM h = inous and not more than three projectors at 2 at 2 ≤ DIM H <inous. 43 Theorem 1. Let A-C ∗-Podalgebra in b (h) with a unit I. Each element t ∈A is presented as a final sum t = ∑ tk ∈ {—I} ∪ (A∩S). From (1) it is clear that the operator −i is not represented in the form of the final sum of the elements from A∩S. Each operator from b (h), Dim h = inous is represented as a final amount of no more than five hypothens [3]. For the final space, only a weaker fact takes place [4]: ​​each linear operator seems to be the final amount of pair of inemerates (in each complicated one of the dubbaters, you can choose an ermital one). Theorem 2. Each operator t ∈ B (H), Dim H ≥ 2, is presented as a final amount t = ∑ tk, where each TK is a work of no more than two semi -heartonal projectors. This result is unreasonable: for λ = r and dim h = 2, the canonical trace of tr (pq) = tr (qp) ≥ 0 for all p ∈P, Q ∈S. We also note that already in the two -dimensional case, the equality of ‖p + q‖ = 1 + ‖pq‖ (p, q ∈P) is not applied to the semi -orthonal projectors proven in [5].
