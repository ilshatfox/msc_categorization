The method of cascading integration in the three -dimensional space below the result is considered by the authors as a continuation of their studies from [1] - [3], devoted to the study of solutions in quadrators of equations with senior private derivatives. This message proposes a method for spreading the method of cascading integration of Laplace [4, §3.2] from the case of two independent variables to the spatial equation of the Bianchi ∑ IK = 0.1 k = 1.3 A (I1i2i) (x) ∂i1+i2+i3 ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ x1i1∂x2i2∂x3i3 u (x) = f, (1) 50 where a (111) (x) ≡ 1. As a result of reasoning, summarizing the theorem presented in [4]. Let ∗ (x1), ng (x1), ∗2 (x1), ψ (x2, x3), ψ1 (x2, x3), ψ2 (x2, x3) ∈ C1 (D) - arbitrary functions. If conditions A (110) x1 + A (011) A (110) - A (010) ≡ 0, A (101) x1 + A (011) A (101) - A (001) ≡ 0, A (101 ) x1 ≡ a (011) x2, a (110) x1 ≡ a (011) x3, a (100) x1 + a (011) a (100) - a (000) ≡ n accord (x1) ψ1 (x2, X3) 6 = 0, A (110) x2 + A (110) A (101) - A (100) ≡ onic (x1) ψ2 (x2, x3), n ∈ N, or A (110) x1 + A ( 011) A (110) - A (010) ≡ 0, A (101) x1 + A (011) A (101) - A (001) ≡ 0, A (101) x1 ≡ A (011) x2, A ( 110) X1 ≡ A (011) x3, A (100) x1 + A (011) A (100) - A (000) ≡ ivil (x1) ψ (x2, x3) 6 = 0, A (110) x2 + A (110) A (101) - A (100) ≡ n accord (x1) ψ (x2, x3), n ∈ N, then the solution of equation (1) is written in explicit form. It was also found that with the simultaneous fulfillment of the condition of the vii A (110) x1 + a (011) A (110) - A (010) ≡ 0, A (101) x1 + A (011) A (101) - A (001) ≡ 0, A (110) x2 + A (110) A (101) - A (100) ≡ 0, A (100) x1 + A (011) A (100) - A (000) 6 = 0 You can build an infinite The sequence of equations of the type (1), such that the resolution of any of these equations in explicitly will mean the ability to write in explicitly 51 solutions of any equation from the resulting sequence, including the original equation.

Zhidkov Nizhny Novgorod State University, artem.zhidkov@gmail.com mixed non -stationary task for the function of electric field tension in the study of electromagnetic phenomena in the atmosphere often used the system of maxvell equations in quasi -stance electric approximation [1, 2]. However, this approximation describes slow processes in the atmosphere well. When describing fast processes, for example, thunderclasses, it is necessary to consider the full system of Maxwell’s equations. 52
