Ozhegova (Kazan), the convergence of close solutions of the weak -random integral equations of the first kind in the space of the summarized functions in connection with numerous applications in the tasks of mechanics and mathematical physics of the weakly -sangular integral equation of the type Ax ≡ 1 2π∫ 0 ln sin ∣∣∣∣ σ - σ σ - s 2 ∣∣∣∣ x (σ) dσ + + 1 2π 2π∫ 0 h (s, σ) x (σ) dσ = y (s), 0 ≤ s ≤ 2π, (1) The task arose to theoretically substantiate close methods Its solutions with minimal assumptions regarding the initial data Y (S) and H (S, σ). To solve this problem, following [1], we use the approach based on finding the conditions of its correct setting. If, as the spaces of the desired elements and right parts, take the spaces of the summarized functions of L1 and the functions that have the first derivatives of L1, then the condition of stability will be violated in the problem under consideration. In this regard, a couple of spaces are proposed that are some narrowings of the space of the summarized functions in which the task of solving equation (1) is correctly set. Let W = w [0, 2π] - the space of 2π -periodic summarized functions, for which a singular integral with a nucleus 176
