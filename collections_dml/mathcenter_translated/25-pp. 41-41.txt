) The mathematical and experimental modeling of the echo process in the presence of an anonymous polarized screen solved the task of modeling a stationary electrical chemical shape (echo) in the presence of anonymous screen in an interelectrodic gap. . Pana mathematical setting of the problem corresponding to the scheme of the interelectic gap of the experimental cell for the echo. During the reign of the task: ~ the hydrodynamic analogy of the samples of the echo. The algorithm for finding the parameters of the problem has been developed and numerical calculations have been completed. Experimental studies of anode shapes were carried out in the presence of a specified screen in the NPC. The results showed a satisfactory coincidence of the conclusions of the mathematical and experimental division of the phenomenon on the localization of the echo zone. L. M.
