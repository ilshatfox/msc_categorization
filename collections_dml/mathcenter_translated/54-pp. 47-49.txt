Antonov1 1 nikolai.antonov@imm.uran.ru; Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.N. The Krasovsky RAS RAS CHA considered one type of convergence (λ-compilation) of the double-trigoometric rows of Fourier, the intermediate between the roller coins and the λ> 1. The well-known result of the convergence of the rows of Fourier of the Fourier of the Functions from class l (ln+l) 2 ln+ ln+ ln+ l ([0.2π) 2) is common in case of λ settings for some sequences λ. Key words: double trigonometric rows of Fourier, convergence almost everywhere. Let d ∈N; Td = [0.2π) d-d-dimee; ip: [0,+urb) → [0,+∞) - non -flowing function; onic (l) (TD) - many specific NATD integrated functions F, for which the function ∗ (| f |) is summarized on TD; C (TD) - many functions continuous on TD. For f ∈ L (td) and vector n = (n1, n2, ..., nd) with non-negative integer coordinates through SN (F, X) we will denote the value of the N-th rectangular partial amount of the multiple trigonometric series Fourier Fourier Fourier F at the point x ∈Td. Let λ ≥ 1. It is said that a number of Fourier functions f λ is at point x ∈ TD if there is a limit of lim min {ni: 1≤i≤d} → mit sn (f, x), (1) considered only by For those vectors n = (n1, n2, ..., nd), for which 1 λ ≤ ni n j ≤ im, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ d. 48 Materials of the International School-Conference in the case of λ = 1 λ-disability are called cubic meters, and with λ = +φ-convergence along Pringsheim. The convergence almost everywhere in squares (two -dimensional cubes) of the rows of Fourier functions f ∈ L2 (T2) was established by N.R. Tevzadze [1]. C. Fefferman [2] distributed this result to the functions f ∈ LP (TD), p> 1, D ≥ 2, and then P. SHELIN [3] proved that if f ∈ L (ln+ l) d (ln+ ln +L) (TD), then its row Fourier converges on cubes almost everywhere. The author [4] shows that the condition f ∈ L (ln+ l) d ln+ ln+ ln+ l (TD) is also sufficient for the convergence of the Fourier Fourier Fourier F. On the other hand, C. Fufferman [5] built an example of a continuous function of two variables, a number of Fourier of which diverges along Pringshaim almost everywhere. M. Bakhbukh and E.M. Nikishin [6] proved that there is a function F ∈C (T2) with a diverging by a positive measure of a nearby Fourier and satisfying the next condition for the continuity module: ω (f, Δ) = O (LN -1 (1/Δ) ) with Δ →+0. A.N. Bakhlovalov [7] found that for any m ∈N and> 1 there is a function F ∈C (T2M) such that its line of Fourier will grow everywhere, and the continuity module satisfies the condition ω (f, Δ) = O (ln --m (1/δ)), Δ →+0. (2) Then, in the work of [8], Bakhlovov proved the existence of the function F ∈ C (T2M), which satisfies the condition (2) and such that its line Fourier λ will grow everywhere for all λ> 1 at the same time. Let λ = {λν} φν = 1 - the non -growing sequence of positive numbers, ωλ = {(n1, n2) ∈N2: 1 1+λn1 ≤ n1 n2 ≤ 1+λn2}. The double row of the Fourier of the function f ∈ L (t2) will call λ-extending at point x ∈ T2, if there is a limit (1), which is considered with D = 2 only by those pairs (N1, N2), which belong ωλ. Theorem. Let F ∈ L (ln+ l) 2 ln+ ln+ ln+ l (t2), the non -growing sequence of positive numbers λ = {λν} urb = 1 satisfies the condition λν = o (1/ν). Then the trigonometric series of Fourier functions F λ is almost everywhere on T2. Hypothesis. Let the non -growing sequence of positive numbers λ = {λν} φ ​​ν = 1 such that λν ̸ = o (1/ν). Then there is a function F ∈C (T2), the trigonometric row of which λ will move almost everywhere to T2. The work was carried out at the expense of the grant of the Russian Scientific Fund (project 14-1100702). Literature 1. Tevzadze N. R.O.
