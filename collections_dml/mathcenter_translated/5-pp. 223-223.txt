The form of solutions of integral equations is studied by the type of solution of the equation t X (t) = j k (t - s) [x (s) + <p (x (s)) ds + f (t). About with a limited free member f (t). Using the theorem of asymptotic resolvent [1], the theorem has been proven. Let 1 - k (z) have a half -rein to re z ~ about the final number well, eu l 1, ..., lk and re l j> O. Let, yes, her r.p (x ) = O (lxi13), o ::; F3 <1, and RE lj f. F3 µ, where µ = maxre lj. Then at. Limited fed solution x (t) = l pj (t) el, t +o (t.6 (n -l) c, 6µt), re lj>, 6µ where pj (t) - some polychids degree and the smaller multiple of the root lj, and n - .1.taximal multiplicity of those l ”, Dl. L pj (t) e> .jt + u (t), i = 1 where and (t) - limited funv, Iya. Literature 1. Derbenev c., Tsalyuk 3. B.
