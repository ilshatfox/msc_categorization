Potashev1, V.V. Razduko2 1 kpotashev@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics named after N.I. Lobachevsky 2 vlad.razdobudko.95@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics named after N.I. Lobachevsky has developed an effective numerical scheme for solving the equation of the transfer of the concentration of the sorbicted substance with a single -phase fluid in the porous environment, an analysis of its convergence through the spatial step of the calculated mesh. The calculated scheme uses the local analytical integration of cinetics of reversible sorption and can significantly increase the step in time. Keywords: single -phase filtration, reversible sorption, TVD schemes, numerically - analytical schemes setting the problem Modeling of sorbed impurities with a fluid stream in a porous environment have a large number of applications, among which the process of downloading a swordsheated translucent of the liquid into the cracks of the multi -zone hydraulic loss of the formation (MGRP) can be noted for the subsequent diagnosis of the inflow to each individual crack. (Fig. 1). The system of equations describing the process under consideration [1] - the Equation of the Incomplete ∂u ∂x = 0, X ∈ D, (1) - the indicator transfer equation (m ∂c ∂t + ∂a ∂t) + u ∂c ∂x = 0 , x ∈ D, (2) where C is the mass concentration of the tracer per unit volume of the fluid (kg/m3), a - the mass concentration of a sorbed tracer per unit volume of fluid (kg/m3), U - fluid filtration rate (m/s) . By the solution of equation (1) is a constant condition along the entire filtration speed current: u (x, t) = u (t). We write the equation of the kinetics of the sorption included in the equation (2) K.A. Potashev, V.V. Razdkoo 151 Fig. 1. A one -dimensional stream diagram near the cracks of MGRP ∂a ∂t = α (c) τ, where τ is a characteristic time of sorption, and as an equilibrium sorption α (c), with a given concentration C, we will use the isotherm of the landmine sorption: α (α ( C) = AC B + C. where a is a sorption container (kg/m3), B is a half -saturation constant (kg/m3). The initial and boundary conditions for the equation (2) have the form t = 0, x ∈ [0, l]: a = 0, c = 0, (3) u (t)> 0, C (x = 0, t) = C0; u (t) <0, C (x = l, t) = 0. (4) The algorithm of the numerical solution of the problem will use the final difference method (MKR) - a numerical method for solving differential equations based on the approximation of derivatives with variable schemes. MKR is a grid method (Fig. 2). Rice. 2. The MKR template - diagrams and calculation nets will write a clear variable diagram of the “corner” type 152 “Lobachev readings - 2019” CN +1 i - cn i ∆t +u cn i - cn —b ∆x +α (cn i) −an i τ = 0, (5) an+1 i −an i ∆t = α (cn i) −an i τ, i = {1, ..., n −1, u> 0 n −2, ..., 0, u <0, b = {1, u> 0 −1 u <0 Where ∆x = ln - 1 is the calculated step of the grid in space, ∆t is the calculated step of the mesh in time, n - the number of nodes , T is the final calculation time. The template of the specified removal is shown in Fig. 2. Cn+1I = cni −u∆t cn i - cn i -b ∆x –∆t α (cn i) −an i τ (6) in the absence of sorption of the component (5), stability is determined by the condition of the chimes: ∆ t <c thank. To reduce the schematic viscosity, we will use the TVD method [2]. The TVD scheme for the equation (6) has the form CN +1 i - cn i ∆t +u [φ cn i +1 - cni -1 2∆x +(1–φ) cn i - cn i -b ∆x] + α (cn i) −an i τ = 0, where φ is the function of the limit of the flow [3]. Consider the following variants of the limits of stream / tilting φ Superbee, OSPRE and MINMOD. Comparison of the calculated crooked removal of the tracer (at A = 0) of the problem (2) according to the schemes without using TVD and with various limiters with an analytical solution (Fig. 3). Rice. 3. The calculated curve of the tracks of the tracer (n = 101, C = 0.1) The imposition of sorption affects the stability of the circuit using TVD with fairly small values ​​τ (Fig. 4A). Therefore, we will use the auxiliary method according to the results of the calculations of which stability is observed with a significantly lower value τ (Fig. 4b): K.A. Potashev, V.V. Razdkoo 153 a) b) Fig. 4. The calculated concentration profiles (n = 10001, t = 0.8, a = 0.1, b = 0.1, c = 0.1) ∂c ∂t = - ∂a ∂t ⇒ ĉ ĉ c = - ∫ â a d a ⇒ ĉ = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c. - (â −a), ∂a ∂t = α (c) −a τ ⇒ â â a d a α (c) −a = ∫ t 0 ∂t τ ⇒ t (â) = f (a, b, τ, C, A, â), (0 <t <t), hence, using the half division method, you can find the value â, and then the value ĉ. At the same time, the operating time of the program during calculations is reduced by 10 - 15 %. The proposed scheme can be effectively used to reduce computational costs in the numerical modeling of the transfer of impurities, taking into account their sorption. Literature 1.
