Materials of the ABOUT THE EXPLICIT Form of Hermite-Pad’e Polynomials A.P. Starovoitov, N.V. Ryabchenko in this article, New Concepts are Introdued: Quite Normal Index and Quite Perfect System of Functions. Using these concepts for an arbitrary system of power series, a criterion for the uniqueness of the solution of the two Hermite-Pad'e problems is formulated and proved, explicit determinant presentations for type I and type II Hermite-Pad'e polynomials are obtained . The Proven Assertions Complement the Well-Known Results of theory of Hermite-Pad’e Approximations. Keywords: Hermite-Pad’e Polynomials, Normal Index, Perfect System, Hankel Determinant. UDC 517.54 The final fox of analytical functions L.A. Suan1 1 laxuan@ctuet.edu.vn; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky investigated the harmonic displays of the circle in the areas that can be cut into the final number of convex hodo. Assessment of the foxes of the holomorphic display of the circle made up of the analytical component of the harmonic reflection was obtained. Keywords: harmonic, single-leaf, n-linding, convex functions, shear design. Let d = {z: | z | <1} - a single circle on the complex plane C, a is the linear space of the analytical functions determined in D, endowed with the topology of a locality with a locality. Through b, we denote the class of functions ω ∈A such that | ω (z) | <1 with z ∈D. Consider the linear space of complex -digit harmonic functions f = h+g, where h, g ∈A and G (0) = 0, endowed with the same topology. Note that the representation F = H + G is the only one and is called the canonical representation of the harmonic function F. Function H is called the analytical part F, G is called the co-analytical part f. We will say that F retains orientation if Jacobian j f (z) = | FZ (Z) | 2 - | fz (z) | 2> 0 in D. Since fz (z) = h ′ (z) and fz (z) = g ′ (z), the condition j f (z)> 0 is equivalent to inequality | g ′ ( z) | <| h ′ (z) |, which means, h ′ (z) ̸ = 0 and thus, you can determine the function ω ∈ B, which is called dilatation F according to the formula ω (z) = g ′ (z)/h ′ (Z), where h ′ (z) ̸ = 0 in D. Let s-the class of functions f (z) = z +a2z2 +· · · ·, analytical and single-leafy in D. Clooney and Shele-Small proposed the method of “design shift ”to obtain a harmonic display with a given dilatation on the region, convex in one direction, consisting in the shift of a given conformal display along the parallel lines. The design of the shift is justified by the following theorem. Theorem a [1]. The harmonic function of f = h + g in D is a single -leaf display of the circle D, convex in the direction is material L.A. SUEN 323 (respectively, imaginary) axis and only when h - g (respectively, h + g) is a conformal display of the circle D, convex in the direction of the material (respectively, imaginary) axis. This theorem can be reformulated as follows of the theorem B [2]. Let the function f = h + g are harmonious and local one -leafing in D. α (0 ≤α <2π). Let the function F = h+G are harmonious and convex in the circle D. In article [5], the hypothesis about the existence ofα ∈R was put forward such that the analytical function h+eiαg is convex. However, in our work [4] we showed that this hypothesis is incorrect. In this work, we study the question of the maximum foxness of the H + EIαG function, where H, G, respectively, are the analytical and co-analytical parts of F for the region, which can be cut into n convex hodo. To do this, we need the definition of 1. [3] The function f (z) = ∑icle = 1 an zn is called P-LIST in the area D, if it does not take values ​​more than P times in D and there is some W0 such that F ( Z) = W0 has a ROLITY P solutions in D, when the roots are calculated in accordance with their multiples. Determination 2. The area ω is called a n-conjudge area, if it can be cut into n convexicated huddings. Let ω is a n-groove area, which is cut into n convex gangs ωk (k = 1, n). Let F = H+G-a harmonic and local single-leaf display of the circle D to the n-conap region ω and dk = f-1 (ωk) ∈D. We have proved theorem. Let F = H+G - a harmonious and local single -leaf display of the circle D to the area If the pi is a n-condensed region, then the function management function = h (z)+eiαg (z) is nothing more than N-lister in the circle D.
