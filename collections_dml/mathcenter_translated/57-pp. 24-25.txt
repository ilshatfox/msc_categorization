Lobachevsky 3 samy@isichennai.res.in, samy@iitm.ac.in; The Indian Technological Institute of Madras in the work obtained an exact version of the classic boron inequality for limited analytical functions, as well as for k -skewonorm harmonic display. Keywords: Boron inequality, analytical functions, harmonic display. The classic result of H. Bora [1], which was brought into the final form M. Rice, I. Shur and N. Wiener, is as follows: Suppose that f (z) = ∑icle k = 0 ak z k is an analytical function in D = {z ∈ C: | z | ≤ 1} and | f (z) | ≤ 1 for all z ∈D. Then φ∑ k = 0 | ak | r k ≤ 1 for all r ≤ 1 3, (1) where r = | z |, moreover, constant 1/3 cannot be improved. Recently, Kayumov and Ponnus presented several improved versions of the classical inequality of Bor [6], and also found a radius of boron for the class of odd single -leafful functions [5]. To obtain additional information about the inequality of Bor, we recommend that we familiarize ourselves with work [2]. First, recall the following definition. Definition. Let F: D → ω continuous, single -leafy, preserving the orientation display. They say that F is a k -quasiconform display in D, if an assessment takes place for z ∈D | FZ |+ | FZ | | FZ | - | FZ | = 1+ | ω f (z) | 1 - | ω f (z) | ≤ k, that is, | ω f (z) | = ∣∣∣∣g ′ (z) h ′ (z) ∣∣∣∣≤ k = k −1k +1, where k ≥ 1. We obtained the following results. Theorem 1. Let f (z) = ∑ happen k = 0 ak z k - analytical function in d and | f (z) | <1 for all z ∈D and 0 ≤ | a0 | = a <1. Then | f (z) |+ ger∑ k = 1 | ak | r k ≤ 1 (2) for all a ≥ 2 p 3–3 ≈ 0.4641016 and | z | = R ≤ Ra, where Ra = √ (1+A) 2+A2 - (1+A) A2 = 1+A) 2+A2+1+A, K.F. Amozova, E.G. Ganenkova, V.V. Starkov 25 and the value of the RA cannot be improved. Theorem 2. Let us know that f (z) = h (z)+g (z) = ∑icle = 0 an zn+∑icle = 1 bn zn is the preserving orientation k -quasiconform harmonic display BD, where | h (z ) | <1 in d and 0 ≤ a = | a0 | <1. Then | H (z) | + φ∑ n = 1 | r n + ger∑ n = 1 | r n ≤ 1 (3) for all a ≥αk and | z | = r ≤ ra, k, where αk = p k2 +12k +12 - (2k +3) K +1, Ra, K = Ba, K - (K +2) (1 +A) 2A2 (K +1) +2AK, BA, K = √ A2 (K2 +8K +8) +2A (K2 +6K +4) +(K +2) 2, and RA, K and αK cannot be improved.

Starkov3 1 amokira@rambler.ru; Petrozavodsk State University, Saratov State University 2 g_ek@inbox.ru; Petrozavodsk state university 3 vstarv@list.ru; Petrozavodsk State University the Question Raise in this Paper Goes Back to the Problem Posed by the Famous Chemist D.I. Mendeleev in 1887 (Solved by A.A. Markov in 1889). In the Next 100 Years, The Mendeleev Problem Was Repeatedly Modificated and Solved. Its Essence is in the Description of Conditions Under Which The Inequality | f (z) | ≤ | f (z) | For Polynomials F and F and For Z From a Fixed Set
