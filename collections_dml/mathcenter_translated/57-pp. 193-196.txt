The speeds of approximation in the circle through the highest fractions, the poles of which lie on the border of the circle of M.A. Komarov1 1 kami9@yandex.ru; Vladimir State University We will explore uniform approximation in a single circle d = {z: | z | <1} Logarithmic derivatives of C-polyinomas, i.e. Polynomov, all the zeros of which are on a single circle C = {z: | z | = 1}. Estimates of the speed of such an approximation for functions from the class of Hardy H 1 (D) and certain subclasses are obtained. It is shown that the logarithmic derivatives of C-polyinomas are not in the complex space L2 [−1,1]. Keywords: C-poline, logarithmic derivative, the smallest fraction, uniform approximation, Hardy space. In connection with the work of [1], recently, much attention has been paid to the theory of approximation by the most rational rational fractions ρn (z) = n∑ k = 1 1 z - zn, k, zn, k ∈C, with free poles ZN, K, and also their generalizations (see Bibliography in [2]). Obviously, ρn is a logarithmic derivative of the polynoma of the degree N with the roots ZN, K. With an accuracy to the operation of complex conjugation, the value of ρn (Z) is a tension at the point Z of the flat electrostatic field created by positive single charges located at the points of Zn, K. Thus, the approximation of the amount of ρn can be interpreted as the task of placing n single charges that create a field close to the given. If ρn (z) → f (z) at n → φ is evenly in z ∈ K, then the poles of zn, k with growth N can unlimitedly remove from the set K, which is not entirely natural for the physical interpretation of the task, and therefore, special interest is approximation The amounts of ρn with certain restrictions on ZN, K. We will explore an important case when all the poles of the approximating fractions lie on a single circle C = {z: | z | = 1}, and approximation occurs inside a single circle d = {z: | z | <1}. Uniform approximation with the sums of the type n∑ k = 1 1 z - zn, k, | zn, k | = 1 (1) (logarithmic derivatives of C-polyinomas, i.e. Polynomov, all the zeros of which lie on C), as well as generalizations and modifications of this task, were studied in many articles, for example, in [3]-[5]. In particular, it is known [3, 4] that any regular function in a circle D can be approximated by sums (1) evenly on each compact subsets D. However, the speed of such approximations has not yet been studied. 194 Materials of the School-Conference We obtained estimates of the speed of uniform approximation in sums (1) in D functions from the class of Hardy H 1 = H 1 (D), i.e. Regular in D functions F are such that ∥ f ∥1: = SUP 0 <r <1 1 2π ∫ π −π | F (r eiθ) | dθ <و, as well as from its certain subclasses. We describe the main design. Let f ∈ H 1. In the circle | z | ≤ 1 for the functions α (z) = ∫ z 0 f (ζ) dζ and g (z) = eα (z) we have | α (z) | ≤π∥ f ∥1, 0 <e --π∥ f ∥1 ≤ | g (z) | ≤ eπ∥ f ∥1, | z | ≤ 1. Suppose, further, g (z) = ∑icle0 gn zn (g0 = 1) and sn (z) = sn (f; z) = n∑ 0 gk z k, rn (z) = rn (f; z) = φ∑ n + 1 gk z k (sn + rn = g). With n ≥ 1, enter the polynomas pn (z) = sn (z) + zm pn (z), m = 2n + 1–q, (2) where Q = Deg SN, and PN (Z) = ZQ · SN (1 /z) (0 ≤ q ≤ n). Since SN (0) = 1, the degree of polynoma PN is q, and the degree PN is m +Q = 2N +1. Lemma is well known. If Polin SN (z) ̸ = 0 with z ∈ D, then the roots of the polynoma (2) are in pairs different and belong to C, and | pn (z) | ≤ | SN (Z) | at | z | ≤ 1. The design of the C-polyinomas of the type SN (R Z)+ ZK+ Q SN (R /Z) (Q = Deg SN, R ∈ (0.1)) was used, for example, in [4] to approximate regular and different from zero at the points z ∈ D functions. In our case, the condition that, according to the lemma, belongs to all the roots of the polynoma PN (see (2)) of a single circle, is carried out for sufficiently large n, for | G (Z) | ≥ E --π∥ f ∥1> 0 with | z | ≤ 1. It is easy to see that there is a constant m <mm, such that | pn (z) - g (z) | ≤ | z | n+1m, | z | <1, i.e. On each compact set in D, the PN sequence evenly converges to the function G (different from zero at points D). It follows that the sequence of logarithmic derivatives P ′ N/PN evenly converges to F = G ′/G on compacts in D. We formulate the main result. Theorem 1. Let F ∈ H 1 and A1 = Eπ∥ F ∥1, with fairly large n ≥ n0 (f) on a single circle, are found in pairs of different numbers Z1 ,. . . , z2n+1 (roots of Polinoma PN) are such that with | z | <1∣∣∣∣∣ 2n+1∑ k = 1 1 z - zk - f (z) ∣∣∣∣∣≤ 2 | z | n (1 - | z | n+1) 2 (n +1) (1+2 | z | · ∥ f ∥1) (A1+A21 LN A1) 1+ | Z | N+1. Note that if F is limited in D (Constant A <و), then the numerator of the second fraction in the majority can be replaced by (N +1+ | Z | A) (1+πAe a) E. M.A. Komarov 195 The next result enhances the theorem 1 in the case of functions F such that f ′ ∈ H 1 (in this case, as you know, ∥ f ∥c (d): = supd | f (z) | <mm). Theorem 2. Let F - regular in D function, f ′ ∈ H 1, A2 = E∥ F ∥C (D), A3 = E2∥ F ∥C (D) (∥ F ∥2C (D) +∥ F ′ ∥1). With n ≥ max {1, a3}, various numbers Z1 are found in pairs. . . , z2n+1 (roots of Polinoma PN) are such that with | z | <1∣∣∣∣∣ 2n+1∑ k = 1 1 z - zk - f (z) ∣∣∣∣∣≤ | z | N.
