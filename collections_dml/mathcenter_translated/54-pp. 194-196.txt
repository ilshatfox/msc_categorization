UDC 519.642 Effect of the clustering of the stationary points of the inhumine functionality in conditionally correct reverse tasks of M.Yu. Kokurin1 1 kokurinm@yandex.ru; The Mari State University establishes that the stationary points of the endless functionality of the unwillingment of the conditionally correct reverse task, which has Gelderov, assess the continuity of the reverse operator, are located near the desired solution of the reverse problem. Key words: Hilbert space, reverse tasks, conditionally correct tasks, differentiated operator. The work considers nonlinear reverse tasks simulated by operator equations F (u) = f, u ∈ D, (1) where f: h1 → h2 is a direct task operator, alleged by injection and differentiated by a freche on a set D ⊂ H1; H1, H2 - Hilbert space. In applications, many D determines the a priori restrictions on the ISSY M.Yu. Kokurin 195 element U ∗ ∈ H1. It is assumed that instead of accurate data in (1), approximations F̃, F̃ are available that ∥ f̃ - f ∥h2 ≤ δ; ∥f̃ (u) −f (u) ∥h2 ≤ h, ∥f̃ ′ (u) −f ′ (u) ∥l (h1, h2) ≤ h ∀u ∈ D. (2) the outcome of the quasi -free method for the method of quasi Tasks (1). We choose a family of finally subspaces {hn} و = 1 ⊂ h1 such that 1 ≤ Dimhn <dimhn+1, Hn ⊂hn+1, N = 1.2 ,. . . ; Φ⋃ n = 1 hn = h1. (3) We denote dn = d ∩hn and compare (1) the endless extreme task of min {j̃ (u): u ∈ Dn}, j̃ (u) = ∥f̃ (u) - f̃ ∥2h2. (4) Without loss of community, we can consider that 0 ∈ D, then 0 ∈ DN for all numbers N ≥ 1. We will need the following conditions. Condition 1. The power assessment of the conditional stability of the problem (1) with the Cossack 1 ≤ P ≤ 2 on the sophisticated solution u ∗ ∈ D, f (u ∗) = f: ∥f (u) ∗F (u ∗) ∥h2 is obtained ≥ m∥u −u ∗ ∥ p h1 ∀u ∈ D (M> 0). Condition 2. Minor ⊂ h1 is convex, closed and limited, 0 ∈ D; The derivative of F ′ satisfies the condition of the lips of ∥f ′ (u) −f ′ (v) ∥l (h1, h2) ≤ l∥u - v∥h1 ∀u, v ∈ D. It follows from a certain constant m The inequality is executed: ∥f (u) −f (v) ∥h2 ≤ m∥u - v∥, ∥f ′ (u) ∥l (h1, h2) ≤ m ∀u, v ∈ D. Let the point U ∗ n ∈ DN satisfies the necessary condition of the minimum in the problem (4): (j̃ ′ (u ∗ n), u ∗ n −u) h1 ≤ 0 ∀u ∈ Dn. Below is a rating for ∥u ∗ n −u ∗ ∥H1. Let PDN have a metric design operator from H1 to DN. Denote εn = ∥u ∗ −pdn (u ∗) ∥h1. The value of εn characterizes the quality of the approximation of the set D by its finally DN section. Theorem 1. Let the conditions 1, 2 and (2), (3) are fulfilled. Suppose that with p = 2, the condition l/m <1 is fulfilled, and in the case of 1 ≤ p <2, the ratio ∥u ∗ n −u ∗ ∥h1 <1 m (m2/p 2l) p/(2 --p) is true . Then, with a suitable constant C = C (L, M), the estimate ∥U ∗U −U ∗H1 ≤ (C) 1/P (mεn +Δ +H2) 1/P occurs the estimate ∥U 196 Materials of the International School-Conference in the case of 1 ≤ P <2 Theorem 1 argues that if the values ​​εn, Δ, h are quite small, then all the stationary points of the task (3), (4) lying in the ball BN (U ∗; M , L) = {u ∈hn: ∥u −u ∗ ∥h1 ≤ 1 m (m2/p 2l) p/(2 --p)}, are actually from U ∗ at a distance of order O ((εn +δ +h2 ) 1/p). Thus, with small εn, δ, h, the possible multi -ethnicity of the problem (3), (4) is insignificant if it limits the specified ball. In particular, any stationary maximum point from BN (U ∗; M, L), generated by the arbitrary iteration process of final minimization, serves as a good approximation for U ∗. In the case of P = 2, when fulfilling the condition L/M <1, additional restrictions on U ∗ N are not, i.e. You can put BN (u ∗; m, l) = Hn.
