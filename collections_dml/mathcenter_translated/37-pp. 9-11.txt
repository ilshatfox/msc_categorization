The study of non -linear gravimagnetic shock waves in the computer mathematics system for gravimagnetic shock waves (GMV) was called the class of accurate solutions of the self -compiled system of the equations of hydrodynamics and Maxwell’s equations against the background of an accurate plain -sophimonymic solution of Einstein’s equations (Bondi -Pirani -Robbinson Metrics). The solution contains physical singularity on a certain wave surface, on which the invariant physical characteristics of the plasma are singular. To eliminate the singularity in [1], a model equation of energy balance was built, taking into account the process of transformation of the energy of a flat gravitational wave into the electromagnetic energy of the plasma: y′2 + ₽22 (y - p - 1) = υ2g2 (x), (1) where y is the control The function, ă2 and υ is the first and second parameters of GMV, G (x) - the normalized amplitude of the falling gravitational wave, p ∈ [4, 8] - the parameter of the anisotropy of the plasma. Despite external simplicity, the equation is significantly nonlinear and can hardly lend itself on research. In [2], 10 [3] the decision was studied analytically, the presence of instability at the point π/2 was established. Since it was not possible to find the exact solution of the energy balance equation, which has important astrophysical applications, the need arose of its numerical study. With large values ​​of the υ parameter and the small values ​​of the lection parameter, the equation belongs to the class class [4], and this is what the difficulties of the first attempts to study it were associated. In this work, the Mathematica 5.2 computer mathematics system built a programmatic procedure for a numerical solution to the energy balance equation (1) based on the implicit method of Adams of the second order. The constructed procedure made it possible to conduct a study of numerical solutions (1) depending on the first and second parameters of the GMV and build a more complete model of the response of magnetoactive plasma on the gravitational wave, as well as calculate the physical characteristics of the plasma. In Fig. 1 shows the characteristic features of the solution in the rigid area of ​​the parameters consisting in the formation of the plateau (section [0.25, 1.5]), the development of instability near X = π/2. 11 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 Fig. 1.
