Let D - rectangle {(x, y): 0 <x <δ1, 0 <y <Δ2}. Next, we denote γ1 = {y = 0, 0 <x <δ1}, γ2 = {x = 0, 0 <y <Δ2}. In the area D, we consider the equation of the next type ∂2u ∂x∂y + a (x, y) rα ∂u ∂x + b (x, y) rβ ∂u ∂y + c (x, y) rα + β u = f = f (x, y) rα+β, (1) where r 2 = x2+y2, a (x, y), b (x, y), c (x, y), f (x, y) - specified functions in the area D, α> 2, β <1 (α, β - whole positive numbers). F.M. Shamsudinov 407 The problem of studying differential equations with regular, singular and super -sulfur coefficients is devoted to work [1] - [6]. The way developed in [3] and [4] for equations (1), the representations of a variety of solutions were obtained using two arbitrary function of one independent variable. In the future, we denote C2 (D) - a class of functions that have continuous derivatives of the first order in D such that ux y ∈C (D). Theorem 1. Let the coefficients and the right part in the equation (1) satisfy the following conditions: 1. a (x, y) ∈C 1x (d), b (x, y), c (x, y), f (x, y) ∈C (D); 2. ∣∣a (x, y) —a (0.0) ∣∣≤ h1rα1, h1 = const, α1> α -1; 3. A (0.0) <0; 4. F (x, y) = o (r δ1), Δ1> α+β -1; 5. c1 (x, y) = o (exp [a (0.0) W (1) α 2 −1 (x, y)] r δ2), δ2> α+β -1, c1 (x, y, y ) = —C (x, y)+rα+β ∂x (a (x, y) rα)+a (x, y) b (x, y). Then any solution to equation (1) from class C2 (D) is represented in the form of U (X, Y) = EXP [−W αA (X, Y) —A (0.0) W (1) α 2 −1 (x , y)]] {f1 (x, y) + ˆ y 0 d s x 0 r1 (x, y; t, s) f1 (t, s) d t} ≡ k1 (∗1 (x), ψ1 (y) , f (x, y)), (2) f1 (x, y) = ng (x)+ ˆ y 0 exp [w ​​αa (x, s) −W β b (x, s)+ a (0, (0, (0, (0, 0) W (1) α 2 −1 (x, s)] × × (ψ1 (y)+ ˆ x 0 f (t, s) (t 2+ s2) α+ β 2 exp [w ​​β b (t (t s)] d t) d s, (3) w 2a (x, y) = ˆ y 0 a (x, s) −a (0.0) (x2 + s2) α2 d s, w β b (x, y ) = ˆ x 0 b (t, y) −b (0.0) (t 2 + y2) β 2 d t, w (1) α 2 −1 (x, y) = y x2 (α−2) rα Rα Rα −2 + 1 x2 α−3 α−2 j (1) α 2 −1 (x, y), j (1) α 2 −1 (x, y) = ˆ y 0 (x2 + s2) 1–α22 d s, ng (x), ψ1 (y) - arbitrary functions of the points of the contours γ1 and γ2. In equality (2) R1 (X, Y; T, S) - the resolving of the clearly written out integral equation of Voltaire's second kind. The proof of theorem 1 is based on the presentation of the left side of the equation (1) in the form of a work of two linear differential operators of the first order. 408 Materials of the International School-Conference using the conditions imposed on the coefficients of equation (1), imagine this equation in the following in the form :( ∂x + b (x, y) rβ) (∂ ∂y + a (x, y) Rα Rα RA. ) u = f (x, y)+ c1 (x, y) u (x, y) rα+ β. (4) In equality (7), introducing a new unknown function ∂u ∂y + a (x, y) rα u = v1 (x, y), (5) we will reduce the problem to solve the following differential equation ∂v1 ∂x + b (x, y) rβ v1 = f (x, y)+ c1 (x, y) u (x, y) rα+ β. (6) Considering the right part of the known in equation (6), we find V1 (X, Y) = EXP [−W β b (x, y)] 1 (y)+ˆ x 0 f (t, y)++ C1 (T, Y) U (T, Y) (T 2 + Y2) α + β 2 Exp [W β b (t, y)] D t  . (7) Now, when solving the equation (5), we express U (X, Y) through V1 (X, Y) [5, p. 26]: u (x, y) = expp [−W αa (x, y) −a (0.0) W (1) α 2 −1 (x, y)] × × (∗1 (x)+ ˆ Y 0 V1 (X, S) Exp [W αA (X, S)+A (0.0) W (1) α 2 −1 (x, s)] D S). (8) substituting in (8) instead of V1 (X, Y) its value of (7), we come to the solution of integral
