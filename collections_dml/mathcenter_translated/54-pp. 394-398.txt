Materials of the International School-Conference. The structural formula of conformal display with the restrictions described above was obtained using the solution of Hilbert's homogeneous problem with explosive coefficients and bilateral swirling at the infinity of the type O (lnα | ctor), where 0 <α. This method of building a conformal display is presented in the work of R.B. Salimova and P.L. Shabalina [1], in which the task of constructing the half -plane to the polygon with an infinite number of vertices is solved using the homogeneous task of Hilbert with the counting many points of rupture of the coefficients of the regional condition and bilateral twilight at the infinity of the steppe order O (| x | α), 0 <α <α <α <α <α < 1. The following is true (see [2], [3]) theorem. Theorem. In order to in the classroom of display (1), (2) there are single -leafy necessary and enough to make the inequality 0 <α≤ 1. Literature 1.

UDC 515.124.2 On the properties of modular spaces V.V. Chistyakov1 1 vchistyakov@hse.ru; National Research University “Higher School of Economics” - Nizhny Novgorod represent elements of the theory of modular spaces on arbitrary sets, which simultaneously develops the theory of such spaces on linear sets and the theory of metric spaces. The relationship between (three) modular spaces and metrics on them is studied in a convex and non -fooled cases. V.V. Chistyakov 395 is determined by modular concepts of convergence, topology and completeness. The transformations of modular spaces (for the right reverse module) associated with their duality are indicated. Statements are illustrated by examples. Keywords: module, modular space, modular convergence, right reverse, ∆2-deposit, modular fullness. 1. The concept of modules in the material linear space X summarizes the concept of the norm ([9,10]): functionality ρ: x → [0, urb] is (classic) module on X, if 1) ρ (0) = 0; 2) if x ∈ X and ρ (αx) = 0 ∀α> 0, then x = 0; 3) ρ (−x) = ρ (x) ∀x ∈ X; and 4) ρ (αx+βy) ≤ ρ (x)+ρ (y) ∀x, y ∈ X and α, β≥ 0, α+β = 1. If in 4) inequality 5) ρ (αx +βy) ≤αρ (x)+βρ (y), then ρ is called a convex modular. In this work, the concept of modules on an arbitrary set X is determined and the properties of the spaces generated by modulars are studied. The main results of the theory of modular spaces are presented in the works [1] - [8], which we partially follow. 2. Below we will consider the functions of the type W: (0, ∞) × x × x → [0, urb]. For λ> 0 and x, y ∈ X (due to non -control of the arguments), it is convenient to put wison (x, y) = w (λ, x, y) and w x, y (λ) = w (λ, x, y), so What is wλ: x × x → [0, φ] (λ> 0) and W X, Y: (0, urb) → [0, urb] (x, y ∈ X). The function W is called a module on X if for any X, Y, Z SERN X we have: (i) x = y ⇔ w x, y = 0; (II) W X, Y = W Y, X; and (III) W X, Y (λ + µ) ≤ w x, z (λ) + w z, y (µ) for all λ, µ> 0. Module W is called: strict if w x, y (λ) ̸ = 0 for all λ> 0 and x, y ∈ X, x ̸ = y; Conversely, if in (III) enhanced inequality (λ+µ) w x, y (λ+µ) ≤ λw x, z (λ)+µw z, y (µ) is performed ([1, 3]). For modules w to x, the function w x, y does not increase by (0, φ) for all x, y ∈ X, so that wλ+0 (x, y) ≤ wλ (x, y) ≤ wλ - 0 (x, y ) in [0, ∞], and the functions (w+0) λ (x, y) = wλ+0 (x, y) and (w --0) λ (x, y) = wλ - 0 (x, y ) are also modules on X. For example, if ρ: x → [0, φ] - the classic (convex) module in the linear space X, then wλ (x, y) = ρ ((x - y)/λ) is (convex) module on x (and vice versa). Another example: if (x, d) is a metric space, then wλ (x, y) = d (x, y)/λp (p> 0) is a strict module on x, which is a convex at p ≥ 1. 3. Modular W to X induces three equivalence relations on x: (a) x ∗ ∼ y, if W X, Y ̸≡icle; (b) x 0) if limλ → ° w x, y (λ) = 0; and (c) x fin∼ y, if w x, y (λ) <nder all λ> 0. Having fixed xyl ∈ X, we will denote the equivivation class of the element X ° according to the relationship (a), (b) and (c) Chere
