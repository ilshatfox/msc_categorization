) The reverse edge task of aerohydrodynamics for the wing profile with a rejected clinter as part of the model of the ideal incompressible fluid solved the task of building an isolated wing profile with a rejected closing according to a given distribution of speed as a function of arc abscissa. Initially, the task of flowing a plate with a rejected shield was first considered, its analytical solution was obtained using the Christoffs-Shvartz formula. The distribution of speed is determined over the surface of the plate and the shield, when the back of the shield, according to the hypothesis of Zhukovsky-Chaplygin, is the point of flowing of the flow. Further, the resulting speed distribution was modified, namely, endless and zero speed values ​​at the corners are replaced by the final values. According to the modified speed distribution, the main reverse edge of the aerohydrodynamics is solved using the quasi -free method to fulfill the conditions of resolution [1]. As a result, smoothly streamlined profiles with a rejected closing were obtained. The aerodynamic calculation of the obtained profiles showed that the presence of a rejected click in the profile allows you to improve its aerodynamic characteristics.
