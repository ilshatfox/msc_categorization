) The geometric and analytical methods of the problem of the coefficients of single -leafful functions are examined by smooth -ocated properties and special points of the boundary hyperplane ∂VN of many vn = {(A2,., AN): F ∈ S} of the coefficients of the functions of class S, consisting of single -leafed in a single circle functions f (z) = z + a2z2 +. . . . Particular attention is paid to the description of the character of the point of point (2,., N) ∈ ∂VN delivered by the function of the kebe K (Z) = Z/(1 - Z) 2. A similar analysis is subjected to many values of the coefficients of limited functions F ∈ S. 38
