The formulation of the generalized task of the theory of filtering in the presence of a point source discusses nonlinear stationary tasks of the filter of the walkie -talkie in the arbitrary area in the presence of a point source, in particular, the tasks of filtering with the maximum gradient, with the explosive law of filtration, etc. It is assumed that the function that defines the law of filtration , has linear growth at infinity. The generalized task in this case is formulated in the form of an equation or variational inequality with the opera of the Thor, acting in the calbert space V functions that have the first generalized derivative integrated with a square (see, for example, [1]). Modeling spot sources is natural to introduce delta function. At one, as you know, in a repeated case, the delta function does not belong to the conjugated space of V*, which does not allow the use of existing generalized productions. At the same time, for a number of special filtering areas from the news, solving some problems in the presence of spot sources (for example, [2]). In this work, an approach is proposed to overcome the indicated difficulty by introducing a new generalized setting.
