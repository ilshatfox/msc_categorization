UDC 517.923 On the regimes of chaotic vibrations in solving the equation of the duffing A.F. Kurin1 1 Afkurin@mail.ru; The Voronezh State University in the article proves the existence of chaotic fluctuations regimes in solving the heterogeneous equation of duffing without extinguishing with low nonlinearity of the Imala amplitude of external periodic force. The ratio connecting the parameters of the equation is displayed, which ensure the setting up of the oscillator of the duffing to these modes. Keywords: Method of averaging, oscillator, bifurcation. In the literature (see, for example, [1, 2]), examples of systems are given in which there are chaotic vibration modes. In this work, such fluctuations are described for a well -known quasilinear version of the mantis equation. Heterogeneous without attenuation in the presence of a linear component of the elastic force Equation of manting z̈ +ω2z = ενz3 +εa cosω1t = ε provided (z, t), (1) where ω2> 0, ω1>> 0, ν - constant values, ε>> 0 - a small parameter, we will integrate the averaging method using the second approximation of the method [3, 4]. To do this, we will use the variables of Van der Field (b - amplitude, ψ - phase, while z = b cosψ), for which we obtain the system ḃ = - ε ω (νb3 cos3ψ sinψ+a cosω1t sin), ̇̇ = ω - ε ωb (νb3 cos4ψ+a cosω1t cosψ). (2) A.F. Kurin 225 by introducing the phase = ω1t, we complement the system with the third equation φ̇ = ω1. Further, in the system (2), after trigonometric transformations, the phase θ = ψ-φ appears. If we consider the frequencies ω and ω1 close and indicate the frequency distillation as ω --ω1 = εh, this phase will be slow. For it, we write the equation θ̇ = ̇-- φ̇. We finally come to the system of four differential equations ḃ = - ε ω {νb3 8 (2sin2ψ+ sin4ψ)+ a 2 [sin (ψ+ φ)+ sinθ]}, θ̇ = εh - ε ωb {νb3 8 (3+ 4cos2ψ+ cos4ψ )+a 2 [cos (ψ+φ)+cosθ]}, ̇̇ = ω - ε ωb {νb3 8 (3+4cos2ψ+cos4ψ)+a 2 [cos (ψ+φ)+cosθ]}, φ̇ = ω1 . (3) The system has a type known in the averaging method [3] ẋ = εx (x, y), ẏ = ω+εy (x, y), where x = (b, θ) is a vector of slow variables, y = (ψ , φ) - vector of quick variables (fast phases), ω = (ω, ω1). The system is integrated according to a well -known scheme [3.4]. In particular, since ω ̸ = ω (x), in the second approximation of the method, unknown functions have the form X = X̄ +εU1 (X̄, ȳ), Y = ȳ +εV1 (X̄, ȳ). (4) Here X̄, ȳ - new variables, and the functions U1, V1 are calculated by integration by ȳ. Note that arbitrary functions that occur during integration, depending on X̄, rely equal to zero. It is in (4) u1, V1 describe only quick fluctuations that are superimposed on the X̄ (T) movement. As a result, for the average values ​​of the X slow variables X in the second approximation, we obtain the system ˙̄b = - (ε a 2ω +ε2 3νab̄ 2 32ω3) sin θ̄, ˙̄ θ = ε (h - 3νb̄ 2 8ω) −ε2 51ν 2b̄4 256666 — ( ε a 2ωb̄ +ε2 9νab̄ 32ω3) cos θ̄, (5) from which the integral is cos θ̄ = hb̄ - 3νb̄ 3 16ω –ε 17ν 2b̄5 256 166 a ε 3νab̄ 2 16ω3 +c1 b̄ (1 +ε 3νb̄ 2 16ω2), where C1 is an arbitrary constant. Excluding θ̄ from the system (5) using the integral, we come to the equation of the oscillator ¨̄b = (–ε 2h2 4 + 3ε 2νAC1 32ω2 + 3ε 3νA2 32ω4) b̄ + (3ε2νH 16ω + 9ν2a2 512ω6 + 17ε 3ν2ac1 256ω4) b̄3 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 27ε 2ν2 1024ω2 + 51ε 3ν2h 512ω3) b̄5 - 51ε 3ν3 2048ω4 b̄7 - 1445ε 4ν4 512222ω6 + ε2a2c 21 4ω2b̄3. (6) 226 Materials of the International School-Conference will establish the patterns of oscillator fluctuations (6), limiting here the first approximation of the averaging method. In this case, as is known [3], b = b̄, θ = θ̄. The system (5) is simplified ḃ = −p 2 sinθ, θ̇ = s - 3q 8 b2 - p 2b cosθ, (7) where p = εa/ω, q = εν/ω, s = εh. The integral acquires the type of COSθ = S P B - 3Q 16P B3 + C1 B. Using arbitrary initial values ​​b (0), θ (0), from the integral we get C1 = B (0) Cosθ (0) - S P B (0) 2 + 3Q 16P B (0) 4. Next, we will consider C1 ̸ = 0. The equation of the oscillator (6) is recorded as b̈ = −p 2 c
