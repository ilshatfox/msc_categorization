. Invariant equipment of the distribution of Kartan N. A. Kuzmina Chuvash State Pedagogical University, Cheboksary, Caf_geom_chgpu@mail.ru This work is devoted to the study of some issues of the diots of the cardan m in the projective about the wanderings of P2M. In the projective space P2M, we consider the distribution of tangent elements (A0, πm) (the center A0 belongs to the corresponding plane πm). In the first-order reoper (the vertices of the rapper A0, AI are located in the corresponding plane of the distribution, and the A0 coincides with its center) the system of differential equations of the distribution of M-sized linear elements has the form ωαi = λ α Ikω K 0, I, J, K, K, K. S = 1, 2 ,. . . , m; α, β = m+ 1 ,. . . , 2m; I, k = 1 ,. . . , 2m. It is known that the distribution of M-Merged linear elements is a highonomic, and only when ten zor λαjk is symmetrical. Suppose that: 1) the number of linearly independent quadratic asymptotic forms φα = aαikω i 0ω k 0 on the distribution is equal to m, a α ij = λ α (ij); 2) The distribution of M carries fabric fabric, that is, the directions of tangent to the lines of the fabric σ ⊂m are paused in pairs relative to any cone of directions φα = 0. 140 such a distribution, by analogy with the surface of the cardan, will be called the distribution of kartan. We attribute the repertr to the fabric σ (we choose the vertices of the AI ​​rapper on tangent to the lines of fabric). Then, in the selected first order of the first order, the tissue equation has the form ω j i ik ikω k 0, where aijk = –AIIAMAαIJK, I 6 = j. Definitor a def = | aαII | 6 = 0 is a related invariant: d ln a = 3ωss - (m - 1) ω00 + akωk0, AK = ASSα AαSSK. Definition. They say that the fabric σm ⊂ m is a holonon, if any of the equations ωi0 = 0 is quite integrated. Theorem 1. If the distribution of M M - Mortary linear elements in the projective space P2M is in a head, then the fabric σm ⊂m is Golononna. Theorem 2. The Halon Distribution of Cardan, which carries the M -consumed fabric of Smirnov, with M> 2 exists with arbitrariness M (m - 1) functions M+ 2 arguments. We compose the 2nd order functions: Q0i Def =-1 m-1 ∑ j 6 = i a j ij, ti def =-1 3 [ai-(m+ 2) Q0i], Aikk Def = {Aikk, with I 6 = K, tk, with i = k, φiα def = aissa ss α. Each of the functions of Q0i, φ I α satisfies the equations dq0i + q 0 i (ω00 - ωII) + ω0i = Q 0 IKω K 0, dartiα + φ I αω i - φiβω α + ω i α = φ i αkω K 0. The functions of the 3rd Order Q0α Def =-1 m {φsαs-[(m-1) q0s + aβs theirφsα} 141 are satisfied with the equations dq0α + Q 0 αω 0-q0βωα + φsαω0s + ω0α = Q0αkωk0. Theorem 3. The fields of quasienzors φiα, Q 0 I of the 2nd Order of the Coprea divide the internal invariant normalization of the head of the cardan. It should be noted that the constructed Normal NM (φ i α) of the first kind of kartan is one of the m parametric family of Foss Normals. Theorem 4. The field of the geometric object (φiα, q 0 α) of the 3rd Order determines the internal invariant equipment in the sense of the E. cardan of the codan of the cardan M ⊂ P2M. Some results about the separation of the separation of Medvedev A. V. Kulakov Kazan State University, antonk_83@mail.ru Determination 1. Any class A ⊆ ωω everywhere certain functions is called a mass problem. Let A and B are massive problems. Then A 6M B and only when there is a calculated functionality φ, such that (∀g ∈ B) (∃f ∈ A) (grap (f) = φgraph (g)). Determination 2. Denote through SA, B = {χR | (A ⊆ r) & (b ∩r = ∅)} 142
