D-risks of these assessments are calculated and the tasks of planning the volume of tests are solved. Keywords: assessment of the Bernoulli distribution parameter, Bayesov’s assessment, assessment with evenly minimum D-risk, quadratic function of losses, a priori beta-distribution, the necessary sample volume of the probability of the probability of a certain event according to observations in the Bernoulli scheme is a classic task of mathematical statistics. In a number of applied studies, for example, when certifying products manufactured by an enterprise, by a qualitative basis, the value of the probability of θ is the sale of a random value. In this case, it is more natural to solve the problem of evaluating θ in the framework of the Bayesian paradigm. This message is built by Bayesov and with evenly minimum D-risk (see [1]-[3]) assessment of the θ parameter with a quadratic function of losses (determining the function of the D-risk of the procedure of statistical output, see [4]). Bet distribution is selected as a priori distribution [5], which has a wide variety of forms of density function. This distribution is standardly used in the construction of statistical procedures of acceptance control. D-risks of these assessments are calculated, methods of the minimum sample volume are developing, guaranteeing specified restrictions on the D-Risk of Evaluation. The results presented in the message are a continuation of research on similar estimates of the average value of the normal distribution (see [6], [7]). Let (x1,., XN) - random sample of volume N from a two -point distribution (Bernoulli) and θ = P (x1 = 1). It is assumed that θ is the implementation of a random value ϑ with a priori beta-distribution, the density function of which is g (θ) = 1 b (p, q) θp-1 (1–θ) q-1, θ ∈ [0; 1], P, q> 0. In the test scheme Bernoulli, there are sufficient statistics t = ∑n1 XI, r.F. Salimov 171 having a binomial distribution with parameters θ and n so that the aposterior distribution ϑ depends only on the value of this statistics. A priori betrayal is associated, and, as you know, the aposterior distribution is also beta with parameters T +P and N –T +P +Q. With a quadratic function of losses, the aposterior risk is equal to the sum of the aposterior distribution dispersion and the square of the deviation of the aposterior average from the decision made: R (D) = (t +p) (n - t +q) (n +p +q) 2 (n + 1 +p +q) +(d - t +p n +p +q) 2. (1) Thus, the Bayesov assessment that minimizes (1) by D is θb (t) = t +p n +p +q. The D Risk of this assessment can be found if you substitute the point T = D (N + P + Q)-P, in which the equality θb (t) = D is achieved in equation (1) for aposterior risk. After simple transformations, we get the Bayesovsky assessment of R (D | θb) = D (1-D) n +1 +p +Q, and the values ​​D are belonging to the Bayesvic assessment θB = {D: d = t +p n +p + Q, t = 0.1 ,. . . , n}. If 1/2 ∈ θb, then the maximum D-risk is 1/4 (n + 1+ p + Q). Thus, a whole part (with upward rounding) ñ = ñ (r) = 1 4r −1 - p −q is the minimum sample volume that provides a specified restriction of R to the Bayesov rating drag: r (d | θb) é r. To find an assessment with a uniformly minimum D-risk, we present (1) in the form of a quadratic function t: r (d | t) = 1 (n +p +q) (n +1 +p +q) t 2 +1 +2p- 2D (n +1 +p +q) (n +p +q) (n +1 +p +q) t + +p (1 +p) (n +p +q) (1 +n +p +q ) - 2pd n +p +q +d 2. The minimum of t this function is achieved at the point t ∗ = D (n +1 +p +q) −p - 1 2. Since T can take only integers from 0 to N, the minimum of aposterior risk will be achieved at the point closest to T ∗ from 0 to n: t̃ =   0, for any d é p+1n+1n 1n+1n +p+q, n, for any d ê p+nn+1+p+q, k, for any p+kn+1+p+q é d é p+1 n+1+p+Q, K = 1,. . . , n −1. 172 “Lobachev readings - 2019” Thus, any assessment that satisfies the condition θ̃ ∈   [0; p+1 n+1+p+q), if t = 0, [p+n+1+p+q; n], if t = n, [p+k n+1+p+q; p+k+1 n+1+p+q), if 1 é t é n −1 will have a D-risk that cannot be reduced at any point that this rating accepts. It is easy to see that the Bayesovsky assessment of θb satisfies this requirement, and it could be called an assessment with a uniformly minimum D-risk (UO.
