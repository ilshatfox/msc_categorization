UDC 517.956.25 on renormalized solutions of quasilinear elliptical tasks with data in the form of L.M. Kozhevnikova1 1 kosul@mail.ru; The Bashkir State University, Sterlitamak branch in the article examines a certain class of elliptical equations of the second order with alternating growth and the right part in the form of a measure of radon. The existence of a renormalized solution of the problem of a conductor for any radon measure with limited complete variation has been proven. Key words: an elliptical equation, a renormalized solution, the existence of a solution, the measure of radon, capacity, variable indicator. Let the paragraph - the limited area of ​​space rn = {x = (x1, x2,., Xn), n ≥ 2. The work is considered the task of the airship for the equation of the type - diva (x, ∇u)+a (x, u) = µ, x purpose, (1) u ∣∣∣ ∂ω = 0, (2) where µ is the measure of radon with limited complete variation. The concept of a renormalized solution is the main step for studying elliptical equations with data in the form of a measure. The first definition of the renormalized solution of the equation is −diva (x, ∇u) = µ, x ∈, (3) is given in the work [1]. Here u → −diva (x, ∇u) is a monotonous operator determined in the space of Sobolev W̊ 1P (ω), 1 <p ≤ n. The existence of a renormalized solution of the problem of the conductor (2), (3) was obtained using approximations as a result of the result of stability. The key point of evidence is the result of a strong convergence of the cut in the space W̊ 1P (ω). In [2], another evidence of the result of stability is provided, which does not require a strong convergence of the cut in the energy space. This work proves the existence of a renormalized solution of the problem of the conductor (1), (2) for the operator U → −diva (x, ∇u), determined in the space of Sobolev with a variable indicator W̊ 1P (·) (ω), 1 <p (· ) <n. Namely, the results obtained in the work [1] are summarized in the context of the constant p (·) ≡ p. L.M. Kozhevnikova 185 For a measurable function p (·): ω → R, we put p - = inf Xphide p (x), p+ = sup xuss p (x). For two measurable limited functions p (·), q (·): ω → R we will write q (·) ≪ p (·) if (p −q) -> 0. We assume that p (·): ω → R The measurable function is such that {∃c> 0: | p (x) −p (y) | ≤ - cln | x - y | , x, y ∈ω, | x --Y | ≤ 12; 1 <p - ≤ p+ <n. (4) through p ′ (·) = p (·) p (·) −1, p ∗ (·) = NP (·) N −P (·) We denote the conjugated indicator and critical indicator of Sobolev, respectively. We define a swagger space with a variable indicator LP (·) as many measurable on ω materially digit functions V are such as: ρp (·) (v) = ∫ ω | v (x) | p (x) dx <mm with the norm with the norm Luxembourg ∥v∥lp (·) (ω) = ∥v∥p (·) = Inf {k> 0 ∣∣∣ ρ ρp (·) (v/k) ≤ 1}. Sobolev’s space with a variable indicator ẘ 1p (·) is defined as a replenishment of the space CU (ω) according to the norm ∥V∥W 1 p (ω) = ∥v∥p (·) +∥∇v∥ P (·). Many of all the measures of Radon with a limited complete variation are denoted by MB (ω). Measure µ ∈ Mb (ω) is called diffuse (absolutely continuous) by capacity cap (·) (p (·) -capacity), if µ (b) = 0 for any Borelevsky set b ⊆ω such that CAPP (·) (·) ( B, ω) = 0. Here P (·) - the capacity of the compact K in relation to ω is determined by the formula CAPP (·) (K, ω) = Inf SP (·) (K) ∫ ω | ∇V | P (x) dx, sp (·) (k) = {v ∈C root (ω) ∣∣∣ v ≥χk}, where χk is the characteristic function of the set K. Then P (·) - the capacity of the Borelevsky set b ⊂ω in relation to ω is determined by the equality of CAPP (·) (b, ω) = SUP {CApp (·) (K, ω) ∣∣∣ b ⊃ k, k compact}. Through m0, p (·) (ω) we denote the many measures µ ∈Mb (ω) diffuse P (·) capacity. In the works [3], [4] it is proved that µ ∈ M0, p (·) (ω) when and only when µ ∈ L1 (ω)+W −1P ′ (·) (ω) (W −1 P ′ (·) (ω) - the space associated with ẘ 1 p (·) (ω)). We call the measure µ ∈ Mb (ω) the singular to P (·) - the capacity, if there is a Borelevsky set of E ⊂ω such that CAPP (·) (E, ω) = 0 and µ = µ | E - restriction µ on E. Through MS, P (·) (ω) we denote the set of all measures µ ∈ MB (ω) of the singular in P (·) -capacity. 186 Materials of the School-Conference Any measure µ ∈B (ω) can be decomposed as follows: µ = µ0+µS = f-divf+µ+s µ-s, where µ0 ∈M0, p (·) and ω) and Therefore, µ0 = f - divf, f ∈ L1 (ω), f = (f1,., fn) ∈ (lp ′ (·) (ω)) n. While µs ∈MS, P (·) and µS = µ+S µµ - S, where µ+S and µ - S (positive and negative parts µs) two non -negative measures in MB (ω), which are concentrated on two unrestrained subset E+ and E - zero P (·) -capacities, E = E+ ∪E-. We assume that the functions a (x, s) = (A1 (x, s),., AN (x, s)): ω × rn → rn, a0 (x, s0): ω × r → r, Placing in the equation (1), Karateodorius. Let there be a non -negative function φ ∈ LP ′ (·), positive numbers â, and such as in P.V. x ∈, for all S
