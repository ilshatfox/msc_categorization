Classifications of bundles of ligaments induced on the distribution of O. M. Omelian Russian State University named after I. Kant, Kaliningrad, olga_omelyan2002@mail.ru In the n-dimensional space PN, we will continue to carry out the distribution of the NSN M-somer PM PM. In [1], a compositional equipment of the NSN distribution was carried out, consisting in the connection to each plane of the distribution of analogues of the plane of the CN -M -1 plane and the normal of the 2nd kind of Norden NM -1. Compositional equipment is set by the Quasithensor field λ = {λi, λia, λa}. Indexes accept the following values: i, j = 1 ,. . . , n; I = 1 ,. . . , m; A = m+ 1 ,. . . , n. We introduce into consideration the tensor t = {tij, tiaj, tai}, called the tensor of non -special displacements (see [1]), which contains a number of shades. The covariant derivatives of ∇jλ equipping quasitenzor λ are expressed using the component of the object of group connectedness γ and form a tensor containing similar shades. 173 Definition. Bunches of ligaments built during the extension of the tensor ∇jλ and its shades to zero without imposing additional conditions, we will call the common beam of mi [2]. We classify the general bundles of the connectedness of the connected way: we use the cases of turning the tensor ∇jλ and its shades to zero and equate the resulting earnings by the corresponding shade of the tenzor t. First, we highlight 2 of the particular occasion, namely, 1. 1 ∇jλi = Tij, 1 ∇jλia = Tiaj, 1 ∇iλA = Tai; 2. 2 ∇ jory = 0, 2 ∇ jory = 0, 2 ∇ IλA = 0. This is how common beams of the 1st type 1 γ and type 2 γ are built, of which the corresponding connectedities are distinguished, the expressions of the coverage of which are found in the work [one]. Similarly, 4 more types of bundles arise on the distribution, from which linemously the style of the corresponding types are distinguished. Thus, the compositional equipment of the distribution of planes induces 6 types of coarse bundles, and the beams of the 1st and 2nd types are extremely positioned. L and T R A T R A 1. Omelian O.M.
