Lomonosov considers the task of inpatient filtering of real gas in three -dimensional space. The thermodynamic state of the gas is described by the equation of Pengarobinson. A description of phase transitions in such gases is given, a solution to the problem of the conductor is given, areas that are complies with various phases are built. Keywords: filtering, Darcy law, thermodynamics, phase transitions. Stationary filtration in porous media is described by the following system of differential equations [1, 2]: • Darsy Law U = −k µ ∇p, (1) V.V. Lychagin, M.D. ROOP 221 where u (x) = (u1, u2, u3) is the field of speeds, p (x) - pressure, x ∈ R3 (x1, x2, x3), k = ∥ki j∥ - permeability tensor, which is a characteristic Wednesdays, as well as viscosity µ. The Law of Darcy (1) is fair for one -component filtration, that is, for media consisting of one type of liquid or gas. We will consider the isotropic environment by putting ki j = kδi j, where Δi J is a symbol of the crownker. • Equation of the inseparability of DIV (ρu) = 0, (2) where ρ (x) is the density of the medium. Equation (2) corresponds to the law of conservation of mass. In addition to (1) and (2) we assume the constancy of the specific entropy σ (x) along the flow: (u, ∇σ) = 0. (3) system (1) - (3) is undeniable, equations are necessary for its closing The conditions of the environment that describe its thermodynamic properties. Let R5 (σ, p, t, v, e), where t is the temperature, v = ρ−1-specific volume, e-specific energy,-the contact space with the structural 1-form θ = dσ–t −1de –t −1pd v. Following [3, 4], by the thermodynamic state we mean either two -dimensional Lyandrovo variety L̂ ⊂ R5 (σ, p, t, v, e), on which the form θ is canceled: θ | l̂ = 0, or two -dimensional Lagranzhevo diversity l ⊂ ( R4, ω), such that ω | l = 0, where ω is the sympy structure on R4 (p, t, e, v): ω = - dθ = d (t −1) ∧de +d (pt −1) ∧d v. Conditions θ | l̂ = 0 or ω | l = 0 mean that the first start of thermodynamics is performed on L̂ or on L. If Lagranzhevo diversity l is given using the equations of the state: l = {f (p, t, e, v) = 0, g (p, t, e, v) = 0}, then the puisson bracket [f, g] functions f. and g relative to the form ω [f, g] ω∧ω = d f ∧d g ∧ω is zero on l: [f, g] = 0 on L. (4) theorem 1. Lyandrovo variety L̂ is set using the potential Masier φ (V, T) [5]: P = RTFV, E = RT 2φt, σ = R (φ+TFT), where R is a universal gas constant. Lagranzhevo diversity L is equipped with a differential quadratic form κ [3]: κ = d (t −1) · de +d (pt −1) · d v. 222 Materials of the School-Conference of those areas on L, where the form is negatively defined, correspond to permissible conditions. Theorem 2. Differential quadratic form κ in terms of the potential of the Mas-Planek has the form [5]: R-1κ =-(φT T +2T −1 your) DT · DT +φ V D V · D v. Consequently, in the area of ​​permissible states φt t +2T −1art> 0, φV v <0. The regions of the permissible conditions are separated from each other by thermodynamically unstable states, where the form κ is not negatively defined. The transition from one permissible point to another, accompanied by the preservation of the specific potential of Gibbs γ = e –tσ+PV and intensive values ​​(p, t), - phase alleged
