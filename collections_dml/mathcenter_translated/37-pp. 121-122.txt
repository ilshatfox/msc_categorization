The resonance zones of the dumfing equation with two -frequency disturbances considered the duphing equation ẍ + x + x3 = ² [a sin ν1t + b sin ν2t], (1) where a, parameters, ² are small parameter, ν1, ν2 - incommensurable frequencies of indignation. The basis of the study of equation (1) is an analysis of resonant zones. An equation that determines the topology of resonant zones, d2v dτ2 - ca0 (v, ipqk) = 0, where a0 (v, ipqk) =   a cos (nv), if ∈ N, nip, ν ν1 = 0 , B cos (ñv), if ñ ∈ N, ñ- is an odd: ñω - ν2 = 0, c, a, b - constants, ω - the frequency of the own fluctuations of the original equation, IPQK - a value that determines the resonant level: pω + qν1 + Ka2 = 0, K, P, Q - whole. 122 Work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (project 06-01-00270).

Miftakhov Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University, rustor@bk.ru degenerate cosmological solutions for the Fermi system with scalar interactions of particles in [1], [2] shows that the correct introduction of scaly interaction of particles into kinetic theory leads to a change in the change Effective masses of particles: m ∗ = | m + qφ |, where q is the scalar charge of particles, φ is the potential of the scalar field. In this work, we study a special case of cosmological solutions when the tensor of energy-pulse is determined by the statistical system of fully degenerated enzymes with a scalar charge Q. In [3] it was shown that in this case the energy density and pressure are represented in elementary functions: EF = m4 ∗ 8π2 [ψ √ 1 + ψ2 (1 + 2ψ2) - ln (ψ + √ 1 + ψ2)], 123
