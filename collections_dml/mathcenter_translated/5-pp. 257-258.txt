) The determination of relative phase diet for multi -layer oil deposits is proposed to calculate the relative phase ponds of the premiums by water and oil. It is believed that the deposit consists of several layers. In the layers, the permeability changes through the linear for stake. Liquids are filtered according to the scheme of jets [1,2]. We determine the value of relative phase permeability. The value of the average parameter of the KN for the entire pack KN = I K, H: N is the number of p.1Asts in a pack. ,, ..: the average knowledge from11, 1 "phase permeability in water 1" q; = k, 0 -l: k.h ". KN; -1 • 'where to "0 = l - s" - with "SN, SV - coherent oil and water. It is easy to see that KJ1+KJ" P = 2 (1) Thus, we get 257 (2 ) Similarly, we obtain the value of the relative phase through oil (2 ') where M, 1 is the number of layers partially occupied by water and oil. Formulas (1), (2) and (2 ') includes the value of K. = To "determining the distribution of water saturation according to the layers. We determine this veh, 1 chica, using the formula (1), and the position that the water is moving most, 1 \! \! The distribution of vita water satisfies the equality not '= IK, , -k "h (3) e,. , K jl - k j2 j 'where E9 is the mobility of water, e - fluid mobility. The values ​​of water saturation S are calculated by the values ​​of E, = S C,, E = L-C "-C,. The next formula serves to calculate the value of KJ, = K, during the saturation process k = l (d-he ')` E '(4) n h n K where a = l j, d = i j · j • j • i kji - K, 2,., K, - K, 2 literature 1.
