The nonlinear task of the stability of the cylindrical panel under the influence of the local load B.F. Tazyukov Kazan State University considers the task of elastic jumps from one equilibrium state to another thin -walled structure in the form of a thin elastic Schendric panel, loaded with a direct Lee with a transverse load. The dependence of the normal movements of the W panel on the transverse load R. The problem is solved by â€œI, the two types of boundary conditions (articulated thawing and strict for the case). For the case of articulation, unlike known Ra Bot [1 - 2), it was received here, here, it was obtained, here. that the curve suffers a leap on W at a certain value of P (excellent from zero) from one position, another, that is, the panel has many different forms of condition at the same load. In the case of hard sealing, the curve does not tolerate the jump on W. Here P> O always, i.e., after clamping P. 1 of thestine, it is necessary at ... "IAD: to the load so that it does not exhale back. Literature 1. Windle Yu.N. Mechanics deford. - M. : Science, 1979. - 744 p. 2. Kornishin S.M. , Mushtari x. S.
