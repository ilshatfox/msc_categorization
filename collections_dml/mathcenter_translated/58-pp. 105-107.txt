The existence of own values ​​and own functions of the task has been established. The initial differential task for its own values ​​is approximated by the net scheme of the finite elements method with numerical integration on an uneven grid with the final elements of arbitrary order. Estimates of the errors of approximate own values ​​and own functions are established, depending on the step of the grid and accuracy of the applied quadrature formula. Keywords: own meaning, own function, task for own meanings, ordinary differential equation, method of final elements, numerical integration, quadrature formula denote ω = (0.1), ω = [0.1], λ = (0, φ ). We set the continuous functions p (µ, x)> 0, q (µ, x) ≥ 0, r (µ, x) ≥ 0, µ ∈, X ∈P. With a fixed first argument, these functions are likely smooth. With a fixed x ∈ ω function p (µ, x), q (µ, x), µ ∈ λ are supposed to be non -growing, the function R (µ, x), µ ∈ λ is supposed to be non -equal and non -relevant. Consider the differential nonlinear task for our own meanings: find the numbers λ ∈λ and non -zero functions u (x), x ∈, such as - (p (λ, x) u ′ (x)) ′+q (λ, x) u (x) = λr (λ, x) u (x), x ∈ω, u (0) = u (1) = 0. The differential equation is understood in the generalized sense. We formulate an auxiliary differential linear task to its own values: find the numbers γ (µ) λ and non -zero functions u (x), x ∈, such that - (p (µ, x) u ′ (x) ′+q (µ, x) u (x) = γ (µ) r (µ, x) u (x), x purpose, u (0) = u (1) = 0. Here the differential equation is also understood in the generalized sense. The linear task for its own values ​​has an increasing sequence of positive simple values ​​γk (µ), k = 1.2 ,. . . , with a maximum point at infinity, 0 <γ1 (µ) <γ2 (µ) <. . . <γk (µ) <. . . , γk (µ) → ° with k → urb. The sequence of own values ​​corresponds to the normalized system of the pieces of curl-claws UK, K = 1.2 ,. . . 106 “Lobachev readings - 2019” establishes that the non -linear task for its own values ​​has an increasing sequence of positive simple values ​​λk, k = 1.2,. . . , with a maximum point at infinity, 0 <λ1 <λ2 <. . . <λk <. . . , λk → ° with k → ∞. The sequence of own values ​​corresponds to the normalized system of the pieces of curl-claws UK, K = 1.2 ,. . . Each own value of λi is the only root of the equation µ --γ (µ) = 0, µ ∈λ, i ≥ 1. The initial differential task on its own values ​​is approximated by the mesh diagram of the final elements method with numerical integration on an uneven grid with the final elements of an arbitrary order. Estimates of the errors of approximate own values ​​and own functions are established, depending on the step of the grid and accuracy of the applied quadrature formula. Tasks for its own values ​​with a nonlinear entry of the spectral parameter arise, for example, in plasma physics [1, 2, 3, 4], in structural mechanics [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], when constructing computational methods for solving mepscheated equations [10 , 11, 12]. Numerical methods for solving nonlinear self -strengthened matrix tasks for their own meanings were studied in work [13, 14]. The method of final differences for solving ordinary differential problems for its own values ​​with linear and nonlinear dependence on the spectral parameter was studied in the work [7, 8, 9]. The method of final elements for one -dimensional and multidimensional differential spectral tasks was studied in [1, 4, 5], and the effect of approximate calculation of integrals using quadrature formulas in the mercenary schemes of the finite elements method was studied in [15, 16, 17]. The theoretical study of the error of approximate methods for solving spectral problems in the Hilbert space was carried out in the work [15, 16]. The work was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan as part of the scientific project No. 18-41-160029. The work was supported by the Russian Federation (project No. 19-31-90063). Literature 1. Zheltukhin V. S., Solov’ev S. I., Solov’ev P. S., Chebakova V. Yu.
