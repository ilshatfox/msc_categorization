The use of mixed hybrid elements in solving elliptical one -sided regional problems 1 M.A. Ignatiev Nimm them. N.G. Chebotareva KazGU, Kazan Yu.A. Kuznetsov University of Houston, G. Houston A.V. Lapin Kazan State University, Kazan 1 Introduction mixed and mixed hybrid formulations of regional tasks with differential operators of the second order allow the use of finite elements (MKE) methods with simultaneous approximation of the desired function and its gradient. The theory of mixed and hybrid MKE is quite fully developed for linear regional tasks (see monographs [1, 2] and bibliography in them), the essential results in convergence and accuracy of such final elements were obtained for nonlinear elliptical equations (see, for example, [3–3– nine]). The 1st work was supported by the RFFI, project No. 01-01-00068 129 The use of mixed hybrid elements. . . As a result of the use of mixed and mixed hybrid approximations, the systems of grid equations with the so -called saddle operator are obtained. One of the key problems is the construction of effective iterative methods for solving the corresponding systems of equations. In the work [10], a spectral equivalent pre -consequent for a condensed matrix of mixed hybrid approximation of a linear elliptical equation is built when using first -order elements. As a pre -conditioning, the grid operator of Laplace on a smaller grid acts. This allows you to apply the developed methods and software in the implementation of the appropriate iterative methods. In this work, the results [10] are generalized in case of elliptical variational inequalities with restrictions on the border. The main attention is paid to the task of Signorini. For the variational inequalities under consideration, mixed hybrid schemes of the first -order KE are built. As a result of the so -called condensation procedure, the corresponding MKE schemes are reduced to grid variation inequalities relative to auxiliary variables (essentially Lagrange multipliers) with a symmetrical positively defined matrix. According to [10], this matrix is ​​spectrally equivalent to the supplement of the shura of the grid Laplace operator on a smaller grid, which allows you to build iterative methods where this grid operator of Laplace is a pre -resistor. The constructed iteration method converges at a speed that does not depend on the parameters of the grid. However, it should be noted that the implementation of each step of this method consists in solving a suitable variation inequality with a m net operator of Laplace and, thereby, the effectiveness of the built method depends on the effectiveness of the corresponding two -stage procedure for its implementation. 2 The setting of the problem is a detailed description of the approximation and the construction of the method will be carried out using the example of the problem of Signorini. 130 M.A. Ignatieva, Yu.A. Kuznetsov, A.V. Lapin, let ω ⊂ R2-an area with a piece-clatter by the border ∂ω = = γd ∪ γn ∪ γc, where γd, γn and γc are the non-overturning parts of ∂ω and mes γd 6 = ∅. Let also v = {p ∈ H1 (ω): p (x) = 0 p. on γd}, k = {p ∈ V: p (x)> 0 p. On γc} - a convex closed set. Consider the task: to find the function p ∈ K, which meets in the area ω to the variational inequality ∫ ω ∇P∇ (q - p) dx> ∫ ω f (q - p) dx ∀q ∈ K. (2.1) we note that the solution of this variational Inequalities are a generalized solution of the regional problem, the processing recording of which can be represented in the following form:    ∆P = f in ω, p = 0 on γd, ∂p ∂n = 0 on Γn, p> 0, ∂p ∂n> 0, p ∂p ∂n = 0 on γc. 3 Mixed production we introduce a new variable ū and write down the task for a pair of unknown ū and p:    ū- ūp = 0, DIV ū = − = —F ω, p = 0 on γD, ū · n̄ = 0 on γn, p> 0, ū · n̄> 0, (ū · n̄) p = 0 on γc. (3.1) In order to determine the weak solution of the problem (3.1), we introduce the following spaces: h (div, ω) = {ū ∈ L2 (ω) n: div ū ∈ L2 (ω)} with the norm ūūū2 = ∫ ω ( | ū | 2 + | DIV ū | 2) dx, h (DIV, ω) = {ū ∈ H (DIV, ω): ū · N̄ ∈ L2 (∂ω)} with the norm ūūū2H = ūūū 2+ ∫ ∂ω (ū · n̄) 2Dγ ihn (div, ω) = = {ū ∈ H (div, ω): ū · n̄ = 0 p. on γn}. Let K = {ū ∈ 131 use mixed hybrid elements. . . Hn (Div, ω): ū · n̄> 0 p. on γc} - a convex closed subset HN (DIV, ω). By the weak solution of the problem (3.1) we understand the pair (ū, p) ∈ K × L2 (ω), which satisfies the ratios   ∫ ω ω ū (v̄ - ū) dx+ ∫ ω p div (v̄ - ū) dx> 0 ∀v̄ ∈ K, ∫ ω DIV ū · QDX = - ∫ ω FQDX ∀Q SER (ω).
