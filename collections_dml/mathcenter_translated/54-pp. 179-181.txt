Krotov2 1 ikatkovskaya@bntu.by; Belarusian National Technical University 2 krotov@bsu.by; The Belarusian State University in the work gives the criteria for the compactness of the sets in the spaces ffic (L) consisting of the equivalence classes of measurable functions F, for which the composition nder ° f is summarized by the antimic space X with a measure that satisfies the condition of doubling. Here ∗: R → R is the even function, positive, continuous and increasing on (0,+urb), moreover, С (+0) = 0, limt → ger (t) = urb. In addition, it is assumed that ffic satisfies the ∆2-condition of the Orlich. Compactness criteria are formulated in terms of maximum operators that measure local smoothness. Key words: doubling condition, compactness, space of the summarized functions, maximum operators, local smoothness. Let (x, d, µ) - a limited metric space with a metric D and Borelevsky measure µ, satisfying the conditions of doubling µ (b (x, 2r)) ≤cµ (b (x, r)), x ∈ X, R> 0 where b (x, r) = {y ∈ X: D (x, y) <r}. 180 Materials of the International School-Conference, let the set of all even functions 8: r → R, positive, continuous and increasing on (0,+urb), moreover С (+0) = 0, lim t → ger onic (t) = urb, ∗ (2t) ≤c accord (t), t> 0. Let ω denotes the class of positive increasing functions (L) - many (classes of equivalence) of measurable functions f: x → R, for which the composition ° ° f is summarized for X. Detailed information about classes ∗ (l) can be found in [1]. In particular, in [1, §6 ] It is indicated that in wor (l) there is a natural topology, the pre -term of which is the family of sets {g ∈ently (l): ˆ x onic (f - g) dµ <ε}, f lus (l), ε> 0. The set of S ⊂ices (l) is called limited in wor (l), if Sup f ∈S ˆ x onic (f) dµ <mm. For η ∈, onic, q> 0 and f ∈P (l) we denote N ∈, Q η F (x) = Sup b∋x 1 η (rb) (b onic (f (x) - f (y)) dµ (y)) 1/q (the exact upper boundary is taken along all balls b. ⊂ x, containing point X). The maximum operators of this kind were first considered A. Ka Iceone [2] for the steppe functions η. For any η & they were introduced by V.I. Kolyada [3]. Theorem 1. Let ∗ ∈ φ, Q> 0 and S ⊂ ∗ (L) - limited set. Then, if for some η ∈ω sup f ∈S ˆ x n ng, q η f dµ <+φ, (1) then S is quite limited in ∗ (l). The approval of the theorem 1 is also fair, but with an additional restriction of 0 <q <1. With Q ≥ 1, condition (1) already ceases to be necessary for the complete limitations of the set S ⊂icle (L). Condition (1) in theorem 1 can be somewhat weakened. Theorem 2. Let ∗ ∈, Q> 0 and S ⊂icle (L) - limited set. Then if lim r →+0 sup f ∈S ˆ x (1 µ (b (x, r) ˆ b (x, r) ∗ С (f (x) - f (y)) dµ (y)) 1/ q dµ (x) = 0, (2) then S is quite limited in wor (l). For unlimited spaces X theorems 1 and 2 are incorrect. However, they remain fair and in this case, if the following conditions are completed from the set S: Lim R →+ger Sup F ∈S ˆ X \ B (X0, R) ∗ (F) Dµ = 0, B.A. Katz, S.R. Mironova, A.Yu. Pogodina 181 where x0 ∈ X is a certain fixed element. The need for such conditions for the compactness of sets in the spaces of the summarized functions was first noted by Ya.D. Tamarkin [4]. For the degree function ∗ (t) = t p with p> 0, these results were obtained in [2]. We use the methods of this work. Literature 1. Ulyanov P. L.
