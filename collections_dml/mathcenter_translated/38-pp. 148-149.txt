Bu criteria for compactness in the space of measurable functions, let F - many even even, positive and perch in (o, +oo) functions of EP, satisfying the condition <p (o) = <p (+0) = o, lim <p ( t) = +oo, t -. +OO F1 - a subclass of functions from f, for which <p (t)/t decreases. Let (x, µ) - space with the final measure µ. If <p e f, then 'Ierez <p (l) we will denote the set (class of the equivalence) measurable functions .f: x -+ jr, for which the value of JY <p (!) DJT is finite. The CP (L) class supplies with natural topology (see [1]), in particular, with <p e f1, it is a complete metric space relative to the DIP (F, 9) = fx <p (j - g) dµ. The set of L 0 (x) of the equivalence of measurable functions on X is also a full metric space relative to the Federal Men -Gl Dlo (F, G) = JX 1 + LF - GJ DPLE. AND . R. Kayumov, a.

Of course, from the 11th limiting of the set in <p (l) you are complete limited in L 0 (x). Next, we consider the case x = [o, 1 jn with a measure of the Lebag µ.
