) The dynamics of the holomorphic display of the circle in the theory of functions and its applications in the holomorphic dynamics (i.e., the dynamics of the icorned holomorphic displays of the Riman surface in itself) the case of the circle occupies a special place and has numerous applications. It differs significantly from the classical case of rational display of the Riman sphere. In this case, the behavior of the orbits is determined by the known Danjua -Volof theorem, according to which, if F is the holomorphic display of the unit circle D into itself, different from the mebius transformation, then the sequence of iterations f 1 = f, fn = f ° fn - 1, n = 2 , 3,. . . , converges locally evenly in D to some constant Q, | Q | ≤ 1. At the same time, Q is called the dunzhua -volfa point and is a motionless (internal or boundary) point of function F. The behavior f in the vicinity of Q in many ways determines the dynamic properties of this display. Therefore, the allocation of half -groups of analytical functions based on the nature of behavior in the vicinity of the Danjua -Volof point and the study of the structure of these half -groups led to solving a number of problems of the theory of functions and the theory of branching random processes. The report is devoted to the review of some recently obtained results in this direction. V.I.

With natural n, we denote all rational functions of R degree through RN (K) ≤ n, the poles of which do not lie on k.
