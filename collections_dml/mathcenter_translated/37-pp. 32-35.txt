Interpretations of the abnormal curves of restoring the pressure of complexly built deposits are considered the task of interpreting the pressure restoration curves (CVD) observed on some wells of the Clouds of the Bashkir tier of the Cheremukhov deposit. They are characterized by an extremely slow rate of pressure restoration and a 4P (t) linear dependence close to a short time after stopping the well. The noted features of the CVD make it impossible to interpret experimental curves based on classic hydrodynamic models that predict a rapid pace and logarithmic nature of pressure restoration. In this work, a mathematical model explains the abnormal behavior of the 4p (t) function. It is assumed that in addition to hydrodynamically interconnected remote controls, the field contains a number of 33 objects (lenses). The well reveals both the main collector and lenses (see Fig. 1, where the schematic image of the object (left) and its hydrodynamic abstraction are given). Slow processes of redistribution of pressure during operation of the field practically do not depend on the presence of lenses due to their hydrodynamic isolation and small volume. The situation is different in fast transitional processes when stopping a well for removing the CVD. In these cases, the lenses play a damping role due to the exchange of liquid between the main manifold and the lens on the well barrel. Rice. 1 Domestic pieces of piezecenement in the main manifold and in the lens have the form [1, 2] ∂p (1) ∂t - 1 r ∂ ∂r (r ∂p (1) ∂R) = 0; t> 0, rw <r <1; t = 0: p (1) = 0; R = rw: p (1) = pw; R = 1: P (1) = 0; (1) 34 ∂p (2) ∂t - β (1) k (2) β (2) k (1) r ∂ ∂r (r ∂p (1) ∂R) = 0; t> 0, rw <ρ, ρ = r2 r1 <1; t = 0: p (2) = 0; R = RW: P (2) = PW; R = ρ: ∂p (2) ∂R = 0. (2) note that the pressure p (1) = 0 is set on the power circuit of the well r = 1, and the lens contour r = ρ <1 is impermeable for the liquid. Гидродинамическая связь между пластом и линзой выражается в равенстве давлений на скважине и заданным суммарным дебитом  r = rw : p (1) = p(2) = pw,  ∂p(1)  ∂r +  k(2)H(2)  k( 1) h (1) ∂p (2) ∂r = −q (t). (3) here K is permeability, β - elasticity, h - thickness, rw - well radius, Q - moron, µ - fluid viscosity; Indices (1) and (2) indicate the parameters of the main collector and lenses. To solve the problem (1) - (3), the final method method was used. Calculations were carried out and the CVD was obtained that are well consistent with instrumental observations at a number of wells of the Cheremokhovskoye field. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 2 for wells No. 5421. Here the calculated person is marked here, and a dotted line is experimental.
