) The quasi -resolved periodic abelevs of the group Yu. L. Ershov in [1] introduced an important concept of quasi -zerosolvent permissible set and proved the statements: 1) the hereditally final variety over the model of the regular theory of quasi -rezerezolvently; 2) In a quasi-zerosolvent permissible set there is a universal σ-function. By analogy with this concept in [2, 3], the concepts of a quasi-zerosolvent, 1-quasineral model are introduced and the quasi-zerosolvent algebras of Ershov and Abeli ​​P-groups are described. This message explores the quasi -resolved periodic abelev groups. A sufficient condition is given for the arbitrary model M to be quasyrezolvent. Periodic Abeleva Group G is called P-quasirezolvent, if there is such its quasi-zerisolvent 〈gn | n ∈ ω〉, which is for any numbers p, n, where P is a simple number, the condition is true: the primary component G (p) of the group G either intersects from GN to zero, or g (p) ⊆ gn. The necessary and sufficient condition is given for the periodic Abelev Group G is P-quadsirezolvent. An example of a P-quadsirezolvent periodic abeleve group, which is not quasi-isolive, has been built. Let the periodical Ableva Group G are such that any of its non-level primary P-component is a direct amount of a certain number of copies of the cyclic group ZP Procedure p. A necessary and sufficient condition has been found to ensure that Group G is quasirzolvent. L and T R A T R A 1. Ershov Yu. L.
