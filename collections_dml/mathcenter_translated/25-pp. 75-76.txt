One direct method of solving singular integral equations proposed in the works [1], [2], [h] the method applies to a close solution of the singular integral equation 1,127g (7 - S <p = a (s) + - h (s, u) <p (u) ctg 2 -du = f (s), 211 "o (1) where a, h, f are well -known continuous 211" - periodic functions, and <p (s) E l2 = l2 (0.27r) - the desired function, and the sin of the gumper integral is understood in the sense of the main value of the Koshi - the Lebeug. Such a sequence is introduced {xn} f 'with l2 of course measuring subspace, and Axn with C2, and and The approximate equation (1) is searched in the form of n <p) = l cxktpk (s) e xn, n e n, (2) k = l where {tpk (s)} i ' - the basis of the subspace XN.
