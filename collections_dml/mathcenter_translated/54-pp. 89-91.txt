Continuation of partial measures L.V. Veselova1, O.E. Tikhonov2 1 lidveselova@gmail.com; Kazan National Research Technological University 2 oleg.tikhonov@kpfu.ru; The Kazan (Volga) Federal University studies σ-addrative functions of the set, which ideally in σ-algebra and possibly accept both values ​​{+urb} and {−mber}. Keywords: σ-algebra, measure, σ-addrative function of the set. The term measure will be used for σ-adventure display σ-algebr in the extended numerical straight line r = r∪ {+urb} ∪ {− least}. We will call the unassumed subclass I algebra with ideal B A if conditions A ∈I, B ∈A, B ⊂A entail b ∈I. It is well known that of course, the additive function of the set, set on the algebra of the sets and taking the values ​​in R, can take a maximum of one of the values ​​{+urb} or {− least}. In this work, we continue the study of “partial measures” begun in [2], that is, the functions of the set, which ideally in σalgebra, have many properties inherent in measures and possibly take both values ​​{+∞} and {−mber}. Lemma. Let µ: i → R - of course the additive function of the set, set on the ideal I in algebra; µ (∅) = 0. For a ∈A, we put it: µ̃ (a) = sup {∑ i organ µ (bi): I, of course, bi ∈i, ∑ i organ bi ⊂ a, ∑ iorn µ ( Bi) determ. correctly}. (1) Then µ̃ - implicit additive functioning of the NAA, taking the values ​​of VR +. If µ σ-addrative on I, then µ̃ σ-additive is naa. As it is clear from the design, the function of the set µ̃ introduced in the lemma is the smallest of positive additive functions ν on A, satisfying the condition µ (a) ≤ ν (a) (a ∈I). Determination of 1 [2]. The pattern of the inle-algebra is called an latter fading from a certain ideal in this algebra in R. In other words, the function of the multiples of the softwork: dµ → R, specified on the non-layer subclass dµ, is a partial measure in And then and only when for any b ∈A class A ∩b = {a∩b: a ∈A} is σ-algebra of the subset B and the restriction µ | a∩b is a measure on a ∩b. Example 1. Let µ1, µ2-two positive measures on σ-algebra A. Suppose: dµ1 --µ2 = {a ∈A: µ1 (a) −µ2 (a) correctly determined}. Then the formula (µ1 –µ2) (a) = µ1 (a) −µ2 (a) sets partial measure µ1 −µ2: dµ1-µ2 → R in a. Determination 2 [2]. A partial measure is called maximum if it does not have its own continuation to a partial measure in the σ-algebra in question. 90 Materials of the International School-Conference Example 2. Let lection: ω → R-random value in the probabilistic space (ω, a, p). Suppose: daw = {a ∈A: ă quasi -intricate on a} [1], µival (a) = ´ a tip (a ∈D's). Then µă is the maximum partial measure. It should be noted that in [2] it was shown that in the probabilistic space (ω, a, p), any maximum partial measure, absolutely continuous relative to P, has the form specified in example 2. In [2] was noted with reference to Lemma Tsorn, that any partial measure continues to maxmal. The next theorem gives in a certain sense “canonical” continuation. Theorem 1. Let µ: dµ → R-partial measure on σ-algebra. Formulas µ+ = µ̃, µ - = � (–µ) (see (1)) set positive measures µ+ and µ - naa. Partial measure µ = µ+–µ - (example 1) continues µ and maximum. Presentation µ (a) = µ+(a) –µ - (a) (a ∈ Dµ) is extremely in the following sense: if ν1 and ν2 are positive measures are such that µ (a) = ν1 (a) ose2 (A) (a ∈Dµ), then µ+ ≤ ν1, µ - ≤ ν2. For two partial measures µ: dµ → r, ν: dν → r on σ-algebra a we determine the partial measure µ+ν as a premarily amount for many dµ+ν = {a ∈ Dµ ∩ dν: µ (a)+ν (a) ) correctly defined}. Thus, according to theorem 1, the display (µ, ν) 7 → µ+ν sets a double operation on many maximum partial measures. This operation will be denoted by the symbol “+̇”. Determination 2. Pathetic meter: dµ → r in the algebra of the subservative pipe σ-zealous, if the BDµ is no more than counting breakdown {di} i organ of the set of sets. Theorem 2. Continuation of the σ-produced partial measure to the maximum part of the measure is the only one. σ-produced partial measure allows only the only continuation to maxilled. Determination 3. Player ofµ: dµ → R in-algebra of subservative pularices σ-endive, if in dµ there is nothing more than counting breakdown {di} I mail ω is such that for any i ∈ I µ (di) of course. Note that any stringent partial measure is strictly set and that the operation “+̇” is associative on the set of σ-endive partial measures in σ-algebra. Literature 1. Nele Zh.
