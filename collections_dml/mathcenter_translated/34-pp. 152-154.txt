The variational principle of the maximum for the task of optimizing the Gurs system - Darbu I.V. Lisachenko Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, I_LISACH@mail.ru Consider the controlled system x′T1T2 (t) = g (t, x (t), x ′ t1 (t), x′t2 (t), u (t)) , t ∈ P ≡ [0, 1] 2, (1) x (t1, 0) = ng (t1), t1 ∈ [0, 1], X (0, T2) = ∗2 (t2), t2 ∈ [ 0, 1], (2) where u (t); ip (·), ∗2 (·) ∈ W 1inger ([0, 1]) - control and ∗ (0) = = °2 (0) = 0. We consider measurable limited control of U with the values ​​from the compact U ⊂ R. We put f (t, l, v) ≡ g (t, l1 + С (t1) + onic (t2), l2 + eed (t1), l3 + eed (t2), v), l = ( l1, l2, l3) ∈ R3. Let g such that the functions f (t, l, v), f ′ l (t, l, v) are continuous. The solutions of the system (1), (2) will be searched in the class w (p) of the ABSO of the ABSUs of the first and the second and the second mixed with derivatives from Linger. A lot of permissible controls U, each of which is met by the only global reign XU, denote ω (p). We set the optimization task: I [u] = g (xu (1, 1)) → max, u ∈ ω (p), (3) where g (· r → R is continuously differentiated. Under these conditions for the optimization task (1) - (3), the following necessary optimality conditions are true, which, afterwards [1], will call the variational principle of the maximum for (1) - (3). 154 Theorem. If (u0, x0) ∈ ω (p) × w (p) the optimal pair (1) - (3), ψ0 ∈ Linger - the solution of the equation ∫ 1 t1 ∫ 1 t2 g′x (t, x0, x ′ 0T1, x′0t2, u0) ψdt + + ∫ 1 t2 g′x′t1 (t, x0, x ′ 0t1, x′0t2, u0) ψdt2 + + ∫ 1 t1 g′x′t2 (t, x0 , X ′ 0T1, X′0T2, U0) ψDT1 - ψ = = −G ′ (x0 (1, 1)), t ∈ P, then 1) control U0 for P.V. T1 ∈ [0, 1] delivers a minimum in the task 1∫ 0 ψ0 (g (t, x0, k, x ′ 0t2, v) - g′x′t1 (t, x0, k, x ′ 0t2, v)) DT2 → Min, K′T2 = G (T, X0, K, X ′ 0T2, V), V ≡ V (T2) ∈ U, T2 ∈ [0, 1], K (0) = ther1 (T1 ). 2) Management U0 for P.V. t2 ∈ [0, 1] delivers a minimum in the task 1∫ 0 ψ0 (g (t, x0, x ′ 0t1, k, v) - girth (t, x0, x ′ 0t1, k, v)) DT1 → Min, K′T1 = G (T, X0, X ′ 0T1, K, V), V ≡ V (T1) ∈ U, T1 ∈ [0, 1], K (0) = ′2 (T2 ). The theorem has been proved in [1] in the assumption that G is satisfied with the Lipshitz condition according to X, X′T1, X ′ T2, ensured by the coincidence of ω (p) with the class of all the administrations are acceptable. However, this is an additional condition, as we are shown, is excessive. The work was done under the leadership of Professor V.I. Su Mina. 155 Work was supported by the RFFF, project 04-01-00460.
