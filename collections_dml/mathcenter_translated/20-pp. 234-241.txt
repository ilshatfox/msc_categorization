Orthogonal polynomials of Heronimus D.V. Chizhikov Moscow Physics and Technical Institute, Moscow 1 Introduction We give definitions that are used below. Determination 1.1. The polynomials are PN (z) = ∑n k = 0 pkz k, n = 0, 1, 2 ,. . . called orthogonal and normalized (short - orthonomated), if their scalar work (PL, PN) = ΔLN, where in a discrete case (PL, PN) = n∑ k = 1 PL (λk) pn (λk) mk, 235 chain Toda and orthogonal polynomus of heroonymus A in the continuous case (PL, PN) = ∫ sµ PL (λ) pn (λ) dµ (λ). Determination 1.2. Toda chain (hereinafter - CT) - a system of single masses connected by nonlinear springs, the returning force of which exponally depends on stretching [2]. The equations of the movement of the CT have the form ẍn = e - (xn - xn - 1) - e - (xn+1–xn), n ∈ Z. 2 Heronimus polynomus in [8] were studied by the polynomials Yn (Z), subordinated to three -membered recruiting relationships , the coefficients of which, starting from a certain number S, become periodic with the period p: y - 1 = 0, y0 = 1, yn (z) = (z - αn) yn -1 - βnyn -2, where {αn} φ1 , {βn} φ - material numbers, such that βn 6 = 0, and with n> s + 1, s> 0, where s is a given whole, they are periodic with the period p: αn = am, βn = lm, n - s = m (modp), m = 1 ,. . . , P. Let l = l1l2. . . LP> 0, β = β1β2. . . β. In [7], the distribution σ (z) with which orthonary is polynomial yn (z) was obtained. The function σ (z) has the form σ (z) = σ1 (z) + σ2 (z), where, with the accuracy of the factor β/2, the function σ1 (z) is an absolutely continuous component and dσ1 (z) = w (z) dz , and the function σ2 (z) is the function of jumps. Formulas for w (z): w (z) =    0, if z 6] e = p⋃ j = 1 [z2j - 1, z2j], (−1) p --j √ 4l - q2p (z) πc (z), if z ∈ [z2j - 1, z2j],, 236 D.V. Chizhikov where C (Z) = YP+S -1 (Z) YS (Z) - YP+S (Z) YS -1 (Z), and ZJ are the roots of the equation 4L - Q2P (Z) = 0, in which qp (Z) = PP (Z) - RP - 2 (Z) = ZP +B1ZP -1 +· · · +BP. To build Qp (Z), the following polynomials of the heroonimus are used: P - 1 = 0, P0 = 1, Pn = (Z - AN) PN -1 - LNPN -2, N = 1,. . . , P, and R -1 = 0, R0 = L1, RN = (Z - AN+1) RN -1 - LN+1RN -2, N = 1,. . . , P - 2. The function σ2 (Z) has ruptures of continuity in those roots of Z̃j polynomial C (Z), for which in any M> S - 1 inequality of the heroonymus is performed [8]. The jumps of the function σ2 (z), that is, the concentrated masses (weight) µK distribution σ2 (z) are equal to µk = 2 √√ √ 2p∏ j = 1 (z̃j - zj) /c ′ (z̃k). The polynomials of the heroonimus, multiplied by certain weight functions, have an alternanance. General formulas for such weight functions are given in [7]. 3 Periodic chain of Toda Periodic chain of Toda (hereinafter - PCT): ẍn = e - (xn - xn - 1) - e - (xn+1–xn), xn+p = xn, n ∈ Z, where p> 1 - PCT period with initial data XN (0) = x 0 n, ẋn (0) = v 0 n, n ∈ Z. After replacement [6] {vn = ẋn, n ∈ Z, cn = e - (xn+1 - xn), n ∈ Z, 237 Toda chain and orthogonal polynomus of the heroonimus system of equations for PCT will take the following species: {v̇n = cn - 1 - cn, n ∈ Z, ċn = cn (vn - vn+1), n ​​∈ Z z. where cn+p = cn, vn+p = vn, with the initial data vn (0) = v 0 n, cn (0) = c 0 n, n ∈ N. Consider one “piece” (period) PCT: {{{{ v̇n = cn - 1 - cn, n = 1, p, ċn = cn (vn - vn+1), n ​​= 1, p, where C0 = CP, VP+1 = V1, with the initial data VN (0) = V 0 N, Cn (0) = C 0 N, N = 1, P. Matrix L (t) =   v1 √ c1 0. . . 0 √ cp √ c1. . . . . . . . . 0 0. . . . . . . . . . . . ... .... . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0. . . . . . . . . √ cp -1√ Cp 0. . . 0 √ CP -1 vp  , m (t) = 1 2   0 - √c1 0. . . 0 √ cp √ c1. . . . . . . . . 0 0. . . . . . . . . . . . ... .... . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0. . . . . . . . . - √cp -1 --√cp 0. . . 0 √ cp - 1 0  . They are a pair of laxa l̇ = ml - lm, if CN, VN are PCT solutions. The opposite is true. These statements are checked directly. 238 D.V. Chizhikov note that L is a self -combined matrix, therefore SP (L) is the spectrum L is the material [4]. Since the matrix L satisfies the ratio of the laxa, SP (L) does not depend on t [2]. Let QN (λ, t), n = 1, p, - are polynomial n - 1, associated with the matrix l (t): q1 ≡ 1, qn+1 = (λ - vn) qn - √ cn -1qn - 1 √ cn, n = 1, p, where Q0 ≡ 0, C0 = CP. Let's make the following transformation: y1 ≡ 1, yn = (n - 1∏ k = 1 √ ck) qn, n = 2, p. We get the polynomials of the heroonimus (yn = yn (λ, t) - polynomial degrees n - 1): y1 ≡ 1, yn+1 = (λ - vn) yn - cn -11yn - 1, n = 1, p, where y0 ≡ 0, C0 = CP, and due to the frequency of the coefficients {vn} and {cn} (PCT solutions), you can build polynomial yn of any degree, and not just from zero to p -n. Consider the simplest special case. For PCT with a period p = 2, we will write down the formulas for polynomials of the heroonimus in the form of    y0 ≡ 0, y1 ≡ 1, yn+1 = (λ - v1) yn - c2yn -1, if n is an odd number, yn+1 = (λ - v2) yn - c1yn -1, if n is an even number. With p = 2, the continuous weight with which the orthogonal is the polynomus of the heroonimus is concentrated on two segments E = [z1; z2] ⋃ [z3; z4], on which it is calculated according to the following formulas: w (z) =    - √ - (z -
