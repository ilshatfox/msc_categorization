The envelope of the family of planes in the projective space of O. M. Khrustalev Kaliningrad, olesya@epc.albertina.ru In the projective space PN, the R-Mortal Family BR (1 6 r <(m + 1) (n-m)) M-Merular planes LM (1 6 m <n). A specialization of the mobile rapper {a, AA, AA, AA, in which the vertices A, AA are placed on the plane of LM, and the indices accept the values: A, B, C = 1, M; α, β, γ = m + 1, n. The system of equations of the BR family in a parametric form has the form ωα = λαi θ i, ωαa = λ α aiθ i, where θi are the basic forms set in a certain area of ​​the Rmeric space of the parameters of SR. Theorem 1. Equipping the on -board of the BR family induces projective connectivity in the associated stratification of projective reperns [1]. The existence of the envelope surface of the original family is established. For this, the characteristic point b = a+µAaa and its differential are considered on the LM plane, which leads to the M (N -M) system of linear heterogeneous equations with m unknowns µA: –µAλαai = λαi. The study of this system allows us to draw the following conclusion. 166
