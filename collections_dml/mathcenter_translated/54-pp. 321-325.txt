The reverse edge task for the wing profile located near the rectilinear screen R.B. Salimov1, T.Yu. Gorskaya2 1 Salimov.rsb@gmail.com; Kazan State Architectural and Construction University 2 Tatyana_gorskaya@mail.ru; Kazan State Architectural and Construction University considers the reverse regional task for the wing profile located near the solid rectilinear border and streamlined by the stream of fluid inconvenient with the velocity at the infinity parallel to the specified border. It is required to determine the shape and position of the wing profile according to the distribution of the velocity potential as a distribution of the velocity as a function of the profile point, a given velocity value in the front edge of the profile and a given difference in the function of the function on the profile and on the rectangular boundary (or the value associated with the indicated difference). Keywords: reverse edge task, wing profile, inconsistent, inhuman liquid, comprehensive potential. Let the wing profile LZ, located in the plane of the complex variable Z = x + i Y, are stuck on the established stream of fluid unexpressed inanimate, limited by the straight line y = −p, p = const> 0, and that has an infinity, equal to vurba, vinger> 0. We take that the back of the LZ profile has an abscess x = 0, D is the LZ profile point, the most remote from the imaginary axis, with the well -known abscissa XD> 0, and the abscesses of all other points LZ satisfy the ratio 0 <x <xd. We assume that the flux A branch point is located on the lower surface of LZ, we denote its abscissa x = xa. We denote through the arc abscissa the LZ point counted from the stream A branching point on the LZ profile in a positive direction in which the course of the current remains on the right. Let W (z) = ∗+ iψ - the complex potential of the current around LZ. Designing through the V Speed ​​module at point Z, through the η, the angle of inclination of this speed to the real axis, we will have W ′ (Z) = VE - IA. The course of the current denote DZ. We take that ψ = 0 on the straight line y = −p, ψ = −q = const <0 on the profile lz. On the arc ADB profile lz we have ′ ′ = v, on the rest of the profile ∗ ′s = −v. We will assume that at the velocity potential point the value of ising pper pper lling ° = a point z of the vel ° Podlor ° Proopter ° Covers, its value at point B denominates onic, believing that the uction on the ADB section LZ is a continuous function from S . If the ll speed potential on the AB section of the lower surface of the profile is a continuous function from S, then in this area with a decrease S, ffic increases from zero to point B, which is denoted by wor. The difference of the exam −con = γ is the circulation of speed V according to the profile lz. We assume that γ> 0. 322 Materials of the international school-conference on the specified part B A of the lower surface of the LZ profile we select the point N, in which the 8 = lus 2, and in the future we assume that the velocity potential of the profile is a continuous function from S everywhere, except Point N with abscissa XN, and when it is bypassed LZ in a positive direction, starting from point N, is increased by an increment equal to worb - ∗ 2 - ∗ 2 = γ. As shown in the book [1] (p. 97-105), if the LZ circuit is unknown, the distribution of the speed value V = V (S), 0 ≤ S ≤ L, where L is the perimeter of the contour LZ, and it is required to find it The form, then this task is allowed only when fulfilling the conditions of resolution - the conditions of isolation of the LZ contour. The above is true for the LZ profile located near the screen. Methods of overcoming the difficulties arising in this case and a detailed review of work on this problem are set out in the book [2]. In connection with the above, it seems appropriate to consider the tasks of determining the form of the LZ profile, which are permitted. As such a task, we consider the following, believing that the LZ profile is streamlined by the above stream with a straightforward border. It is required to find the shape of the LZ profile, the position of the straight line of the y = −p, i.e. The number p, and the speed of the unperturbed flow vift, if the distribution of the ll ll potential is set on LZ, as the function of the abscess X of the profile point lz in the form ∗ = ∗+(x), 0 ≤ x ≤ xd, on the upper surface, ship ll = ∗ - (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ xd, on the lower surface, (1), and onic + (0) = onic - (0) = worb, ∗ - (xn + 0) = ∗ 2, ip - (xa) = 0, ∗ - (xn - 0) = worb - ∗ 2, onic+(xd) = ∗ - (xd), here worb, СA, xa, xn, xd are known numbers, in addition, the value of the velocity is vd = v | X = XD at the point D of the profile lz and the above number Q. We assume that ∗+(x), ∗ - (x) - differentiated functions, the derivatives of which satisfies the condition of Helder in the interval [0, XD), and in the vicinity of the point x = xD for the above derivatives, the representation (∗ ± (x)) ′ x = φ ± (x)/(xd −x) 1 2, φ ± (xd) ̸ = 0. Similarly as done in [1 ] (p. 97-105), it is advisable to assume that the derivatives (∗ ± (x)) ′ are set and then the values ​​С ± (x) are calculated. When setting the values ​​of these derivatives, we take into account that for points LZ, the ratio V/COS] is true. If the desired LZ contour is sufficient in shape
