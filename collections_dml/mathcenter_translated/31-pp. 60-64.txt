. Generalization of the function of the distance of Rimanov’s diversity and their application by Yu. V. Ershov Nizhny Novgorod State University 62 Let (M, G)-complete Rimano diversity, ω (m, p, q)-space of pieces of diversity of diversity M, connecting points p, q ∈ M. Suppose [c] is a different class of singular homologies with whole space coefficients ω (m, p, q). It is known [1] that the class [c] corresponds to the critical value L [c] = inf cment [c] sup xuss | c | L (x) the functionality of the length l: ω (m, p, q) → R, where | C | - The carrier of the cycle C. We denote the symbol n ∗ (m) the set of such k ∈ N∪ {0}, that hk (ω (m, p, q)) 6 = 0 for p, q ∈ M. Since the homotopic type of space ω (m, p, q) on points P and Q does not depend, the designation is correct. For each k ∈ N ∗ (m), we put DK (p, q) = Inf [c] ∈Hk (ω (m, p, q)) \ {0} l [c]. (1) Drying 1. For all K ∈ N ∗ (M), the formula (1) determines the display DK: M × M → R, which has properties: (1) dk (p, q) ≥ d0 (p, q) for arbitrary p, q ∈ M; (2) dk (p, q) = dk (q, p) for the same p, q; (3) dk (p, r) ≤ dk (p, q) + d0 (q, r) for all p, q, r ∈ M; (4) DK display continuously. Built in sentence 1 DK: M × M → R, we call the HK state function (M, G). Note that D0 coincides with the usual function of the distance of Rimanov variety (M, G). Sentence 2. For arbitrary k ∈ N ∗ (m) and p, q ∈ M, the number dk (p, q) is a critical value of the length of the length l: ω (m, p, q) → R. Drying 3. Suppose that hm is hm (M, z) 6 = 0 at least for one natural m. Then, for any 63 Δ> 0 and an arbitrary pair of points p, q ∈ M, there is such a monotonously increasing sequence of natural numbers {kn} n∈N, that KN ∈ N ∗ (M) and dkn (p, q) <dkn+1 ( p, q) - δ for all n ∈ N. In the work [2], a variational task with fixed ends for multi -valued functionality, describing the dynamics of the system with gyroscopic forces, is reduced to the study of geodetic rimanes, stabbed over the configuration diversity of the system. With the help of this reduction, the conditions for the existence of solutions to the original problem were obtained. The functions of the HK state are planned to be used to develop the results of work [2]. L and T R A T R A 1. LUSTRAN L.A.
