Converting Hardy and Bellman for the orthogonal rows Fourier the orthonomated system φ = {φk (x)} φk = 1 will call regular if there is such a constant b, that: 1) for any segment E of [0, 1] and K ∈ N ∣ ∣∣∣ ∫ e φk (x) dx ∣∣∣∣ ≤ b min (µe, 1/k), 2) for any segment W (final arithmetic progression with step 1) from n and t ∈ [0, 1] ( ∑ korn φk (f) ∗ (t) ≤ b min (| w |, 1/t), where (∑ k∈W φk (f)) ∗ (t) is an irresponsible rearrangement of the function∑ k∈W φk (x), | W | - The number of elements in the set W. Let φ is a regular orthonomated system, I = {ik} k organ - a certain sequence of the final subset from n. Through J, we denote the sequence of sets {jk} k organ, where JK = {m: k ∈ IM}. For f ∈ L1 [0, 1], f ∼ n∑ k = 1 ak accord (x) and sequence i = {ik} k organ, we determine the transformation 216 h (f; i) and b (f; i) in the following way H (f; i) ∼ φ∑ k = 1 1 | ik | (∑ morn am) ∗, b (f; i) ∼ φ∑ k = 1 (∑ morn Am | Im |) onic (x). We will call them according to the transformations of Hardy and Bellman, which meet the sequence of sets I = {ik} korn. In the case of IK = {1, 2, ..., K}, K ∈ N, the transformations are according to the transformations of Hardy and Bellman. Through LPQ [0, 1], we denote the space of the Lorentz and through LPQ - the discrete space of the Lorentz. Theorem 1. Let 2 <p <mm, p ′ = p/(p - 1), 1 ≤ q ≤ φ, φ = {onic (x)} φk = 1 - regular system, i = {ik} وges = 1 - a family of segments in n those that | IK | ≥ k (| IK | - the number of elements in IK). Then the transformations of Hardy H (F, I) and Bellman B (F, I) are limited in the spaces of LPQ [0, 1] and lp′q [0, 1], respectively, i.e. ‖H (f, i) ‖lpq ≤ c‖f‖lpq, ‖b (f, i) ‖lp′q ≤ c‖f‖lp. Theorem 2. Let 1 <p ≤ 2, p ′ = p/(p - 1), 1 ≤ q ≤ φ, φ = {onic (x)} وger = 1 - regular system, i = {ik} وges = 1 - a family of the final sets of n that satisfy the conditions | IK | = K and IK ⊂ IK+1. Then the transformations of Hardy H (F, I) and Bellman B (F, I) are limited in the spaces of LPQ [0, 1] and lp′q [0, 1], respectively. K.V. Trunov, R. S.
