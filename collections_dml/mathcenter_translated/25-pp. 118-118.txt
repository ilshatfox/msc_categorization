) Emergency apolation property of polyinomas, let PN - many algebraic polynomas; E C [-1, 1], F E C (-OO, OO); llfllv = sup {/f (x): x her}. Put vn (x; e;!) = Sup {/p (x) - f (x) i: re pn, llp - f // in ~ 1}. If f = o, then vn (x; e; j) = vn (x; e). The report will set out the properties of the function VN (x; e) for various subset E C [-1, 1]. The work was supported by Grant RFFIF (project 04-01-00042). 118
