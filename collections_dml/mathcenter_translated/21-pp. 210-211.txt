Geometric features of the algebraic surface V.V. Teplyakov Pomeranian State University, f. Math@pomorsu.ru examines the features of the spherical display µ:+ -+ -+ S3 algebraic surface F3: e x ~ xj = a2, its curvature l: si <j: s4 and topological structure. This surface is a multidimensional analogue of the known narrowing surface with eight special points lxl = iyi = lzl = (a /../ 3) 112, the order of the seventh -like. In special points, the second form is • 1e, and the spherical display µ: f 2 -+ s 2 is two -faced. The three -dimensional analogue of this surface F3 from E4 has the next properties: F 3 is also a hyperbolic surface; It has eight departures for infinity in the form of tapering labor (YUK 8 2 x R, and the belts of these tubes are only enough and lico; many special then • 1k on F 3 is a graph from the top at 32 points; from each vertex it leaves along 6 ribs; in the vertices of this graph, the core of the spherical display has a dimension of Ker dµ = 2; on the ribs of the column kcr dµ = 1, nevertheless, in the vicinity of these points, the spherical display remains homeomorphism; about the surroundings of the vertices of the graph, the spherical display is not in -in -person and has an unknown feature . 210 These results were obtained using the properties of the gradient disposal Grad F: {F.; 1} ---+ R4, o <a <oo, where / = l; x ~ xj. This is l; si <j; s4 display associated with the spherical display µ.: {f;} ...-+ S3 by the next switching diagram: D (Grod /) --- t R4 .L.P txf: = t s ~ (x) where d (grad /)-differential gradient display; dµ: tzhf: ---+ tµ (x) s 3 = txf:-differential spherical disposal ; ID: txf: ---+ R4 -identical entry; R: R4 ...-+ txf: - projection R4 for subspace, i.e. Transition to GO risont. 111, a component of the differential of the gradient d (grad j) (v) = = v ',: grad f = y',: (>.

The same as the signs of the corresponding values ​​of D (grad /(x)). This allows you to calculate the signature of the second square shape of the surface under consideration. Literature 1.
