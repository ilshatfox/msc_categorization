) The linear convexity of the Harstogs regions in C2 and the new classes of flat discs with the only extremum of the hyperbolic derivative condition of linear convexity along the Benke-Pesch of the regions of the HAR TOGS of a special species leads to the release of the series of the unity of the extremum of hyperbolic parametrisations by a unit circle of the n; the south hyperbo. . In this case, a peculiar "stiffness effect" arises, consisting in the fact that the classes of some subfamily of this series are empty. The presence of a suture derivative in the definition of the classes of the series (one of them is from the messenger "Salchari Ball") allows you to compare the Goering technique according to:-. 1-dimensional (for the first time "worked out" when identifying the indicated "ball" as K: TASAS is the only place11) 11 Devast: 1 , 1st AB TORM technique of parametric families.
