For functions from the S0H, the exact assessment is not known even in the case of | A2 |. The purpose of this work is to receive assessments (not accurate) | An | <5.24 × 10–6N17 and | BN | <2.32 × 10–7N17 for all n ≥ 3 and f = ∈ S0H, and the assessments of the radii of one -leafness of partial sums of single -leaf harmonic display were also obtained. We received assessments of the radius of single -leafness of partial amounts of normalized single -leaf -harmonic displays of a single circle to convex, star -shaped, almost convex, convex in the direction of the region. In the case of display to convex areas, the result is accurate. Keywords: harmonic one -leaf functions, partial amounts, assessments of the coefficients. 168 Materials of the International School-Conference are many analytical and single-leafy in the circle d = {z ∈ C: | z | <1} Functions f (z) = z + ger∑ n = 2 an z n are denoted by S. Denote through SN (F) (Z) = Z + N∑ K = 2 AK Z K K -K K of the corresponding partial amount. The task of studying partial amounts SN (F), n ∈N, functions F ∈ S are one of the classical tasks of complex analysis. A tattered problem in class S is the determination of the largest value rn ∈ (0.1), in which SN (F) are one -leaf in a circle {| z | <rn} For all f ∈ S. Segeo [1] proved that infN rn = 1/4. The best result in assessment RN (n> 1) belongs to Jenkins [2]: rn ≥ 1 - (4logn - log (4logn))/n for n ≥ 8. We denote the harmonic one -leaf display f (z), f (0 through the SH class ) = 0, fz (0) = 1. It is known that such display is the only way in the form of f (z) = h (z)+g (z), h and g - analytical in d, h (0) = 0 , h ′ (0) = 1. The symbol S0H denot the subclass SH, in which g ′ (0) = 0. Subclasses of functions from SH, displaying D to star -shaped relatively 0 or almost convex areas (area ω is called almost convex if the addition to It can be presented in the form of a combination of rays, intersecting, perhaps only in their peaks), indicate, respectively, S ∗ H or Ch. The last 2 classes, possessing useful geometric properties, are not compact in the topology of uniform convergence inside D. Therefore, for the convenience of research, their compact subclasses S ∗ 0H and C 0 H, in which G ′ (0) = 0; There is a simple connection between the classes S ∗ H, CH and the indicated by their subclasses. For natural n and m and for the function f ∈ SH, we denote SN, M (F) (Z) = SN (H) (Z)+ SM (G) (Z). The message presented here is based on the publication of the authors [3] and [4] and significantly uses the results from [5]. In particular, theorem 1 [3] is proved. Let F = h + g ∈ S0H belongs to one of the subclasses: S ∗ H, Ch or a convex class in the direction of harmonic functions (i.e., each line on the plane parallel to some fixed, crosses F (D) according to the coherent set). Then partial amounts SN, M (F) are one -leaf in the circle {z ∈ D: | z | <rn, m}, where rn, m is the only positive root of the equation 1 12R (1 - R 1+ R) 3 [1 - (1 - R 1+ R) 6] −RN –TM = 0, RN = ger∑ k = n +1 AK R K - 1, TM = - φ∑ K = m +1 A -K R K - 1, AK = K (K +1) (2K +1) 6. In particular, partial amounts SN, N (F) (Z) are one -leaf in the circle {| z | <rn}, where rn> r ln: = 1 - 7logn −4log (logn) n at n ≥ 15. In addition, rn, m ≥ r ll, where l = min (n, m) ≥ 15. We denote through kH ⊂ SH the subset of all convex functions, i.e. functions for which F (D) is a convex area. The specifics of the KH class allows you to improve the assessment of the radius of one -leafness RN, m of the hourly amounts in this class. Theorem 2 [3]. Let F = h + g ∈ KH ∩ S0H. Then the partial amount is SN, m (f) one fox in the circle {z ∈ D: | z | <rn, m}, where rn, m is the only positive root
