The presentation of the space of whole functions by the pairs of Fisher V.V. Napalkov, A. A. Nuyatov Institute of Mathematics with the CU U -Council of Ministers of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Shaig@anrb.ru Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, root@mm.un.ru let PN (Z) and QM (Z) - polynomials of degrees N and M. Through IP (Z), we denote the ideal in the algebra of all the whole functions H (C), generated by the polynomial p (z). Let the WQ - the space of all solutions of the differential equation Q (D DZ) Y = 0. Consider many functions of the type IP +WQ. It is known that if n = m and qn (z) = pn (z), then h (c) = ip ⊕wq (symbol ⊕ means direct amount). The question naturally arises: what is the amount of IP +WQ in the case when the degree of M> N or M <n? Consider the case when the degree of polynoma Q (Z) is more than the degree of polynoma P (Z), that is, Degq> Degp. The polynomial Q (Z) will always imagine in the form of a work of two polynomials of the lesser degree: Q (Z) = Q1Q2 (Z), moreover, Degq1 = 169 = Degp. Then the space h (c) can be represented as a direct amount: h (c) = IP ⊕WQ1. Since WQ consists of linear combinations of the exhibit, then WQ = WQ1 ⊕WQ2, and, therefore, WQ1 ⊂ WQ. Let ∗ (z) ∈ WQ. This means that wor (z) = h (z)+g (z), h (z) ∈ IP, G (z) ∈WQ1. Then wor (z) - g (z) = h (z), where it follows that h (z) ∈ WQ2, but h (z) ∈ IP, therefore IP ⋂ wq 6 = ∅, that is, the space of integers Representable in the form of H (C) = IP +WQ, but not represented in the form of a direct amount. Let us now consider the case when the degree of polynoma p (z) is more than the degree of polynoma Q (Z), i.e., Degp> Degq. We always imagine the polynomial p (z) as a work of two polynomials of the lesser extent: p (z) = p1p2 (z), moreover, degp1 = = degq. Then the space h (c) can be represented as a direct amount: h (c) = IP1 ⊕WQ. Let f (z) ∈ IP, then F (Z) = H (Z)+G (Z), H (Z) ∈ IP1, G (Z) ∈WQ. Since IP ⊂ IP1, then F (Z) = H (Z), which is incorrect, therefore, in the case of Degp> Degq, the sum ip ⊕wq does not coincide with H (C). L and T R A T R A 1. SHAPIRO H.S. An Algebraic Theorem of E.
