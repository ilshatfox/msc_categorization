N.E. Bauman studies the properties of many P-median for X1 elements ,. . . , XN Banakhov space. The condition for the intersection of the set P-median and many points of the Steiner for elements X1 is formulated ,. . . , xn. Key words: points of the Steiner, P-Medians, Banakhov’s space. Let (x, ∥ · ∥) - banakh space. For a given set Mn = {X1 ,. . . , xn} ⊂ x, many p-median consists of such points s ∈ X, for which n∑ k = 1 ∥xk-s∥p = inf {n∑ k = 1 ∥xk −x∥p: x ∈ X}. Recall that many points of the Steiner (in the English literature - median) ST (MN) consists of such points S ∈ X, for which n∑ k = 1 ∥xk - s∥ = inf {n∑ k = 1 ∥xk −x∥ : x ∈ X}. 50 Materials of the School-Conference note that the points of the Steiner are P-Medians at P = 1, and the Chebeshev centers are P-Medians at p = inous (point S is called the Chebyshev center for mn if Maxn K = 1∥xi-S ∥ = Inf {maxn k = 1∥xk −x∥: x ∈ X}). The main properties of the P-median are reflected in [1]. The next two lemmas are the generalizations of the choresho of the well -known criterion of the element of the best approximation [2]. Lemma A. Let Mn = {X1 ,. . . , xn} ⊂ x. The element S ∈ X belongs to the set P-median for then the result, when there are F1 F1 ,. . . , fn ∈ X ∗ that 1) ∑n j = 1 f j = 0; 2) ∥ f j∥ = k ∥x j - s - p q with some ̸ = 0; 3) f j (x j - s) = ∥x j - s. Lemma B. Let Mn = {X1 ,. . . , xn} ⊂ x. The element S ∈ X belongs to the set ST (mN) when and only when such functionality F1 is found ,. . . , fn ∈ X ∗ that 1) ∑n j = 1 f j = 0; 2) max∥ f j∥ = 1; 3) f j (x j - s) = ∥x j - s∥. The last equality means that either ∥ f j∥ = 1, or x j = s. The theorem follows from these lemmas. Let mn = {x1,. . . , xn} ⊂ x, s ∈ ST (Mn) and distances ∥xi - S∥ are the same for each j = 1 ,. . . , n. Then S belongs to the P-median for each p ∈ (1, urb). From this theorem and an example built in paragraph D, theorem 6 of the work [3], it follows that there is a three -dimensional strict smooth space in which there is no lipshit sample from a display comparing a set of points {x1 ,. . . , xn} There are many of their p-median.
