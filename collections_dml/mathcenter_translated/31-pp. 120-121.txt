The resolving of the boundary problem for the Maxwell system in the semi -intelligence of the I. N. Pleshchinsky State University, pnb@ksu.ru Let D - semi -intelligence (z> 0) Cylindrical region, limited to the side of the cylindrical surface R and from the end - transverse cross section S ( part of the plane z = 0). We will look for Maxwell equations for 121 in D
