) A way of setting the reverse task of the theory of elasticity in accordance with the formulations of the main tasks of the flat theory of elasticity [1] and reverse regional tasks for analytical functions [2] set the task of finding the final area of ​​elastic deformation according to the compliance between the vector of external efforts and the vector of movements during its border the known length of the border arc. Mathematically, the task is reduced to finding the area D and the analytical functions F (Z) and G (Z) with specified integrated functions R1 (σ) and R2 (σ), 0 ≤ σ ≤ l, where l is the length of the boundary curve l = ∂ ∂ ∂ D, if [f (z) + zf ′ (z) + g (z)] | zatory = r1 (ω (s)), [κf (z) - zf ′ (z) - g (z)] | Zorn = R2 (ω (S)), 240 ω (S) - an unknown monotonously increasing function, ∫ l 0 ω ′ (s) ds = l. Suppose that the curve γ = {w = r1 (σ) + r2 (σ), 0 ≤ σ ≤ l} is the boundary of the area obtained by a conformal display of a single circle w = f (ζ), | ζ | <1, at the same time σ = r (θ), - π ≤ θ ≤ π. Consider the decomposition κR1 (R (θ)) - R2 (R (θ)) (F (Exp Iθ)) ′ θ = +φ∑ n = − least ane inθ. The task will be solved if the endless matrix B = AA has its own value 1, where a =   a -2 A -3 A -4. . . 2A-3 2A-4 2A-5. . . 3a-4 3a-5 3a-6. . . ... .... . .  , and the matrix A is obtained from A with a complex conjugation of elements. Then the own vector corresponding to this value C = (C1, C2, ...), normalized by the condition ∫ π −π | Φ∑ k = 1 cke ikθ | dθ = l, makes it possible to get the function φ ′ (r (θ)) = | ∑icle = 1 ckeikθ | r ′ (θ), where φ = ω - 1. Now the equation of the curve l - the boundaries of the desired region - is obtained by the formula Z = C0 + E I am ∫ θ θ φ ′ (r (θ) r ′ (θ) ei (β (θ) + θ) dθ ) = - 1 2π ∫ π π [ln φ ′ (r (θ)) + ln r ′ (θ)] ctg τ - θ 2 dτ, α, c0 - arbitrary material and complex constant. 241 L and T R A T R A 1.
