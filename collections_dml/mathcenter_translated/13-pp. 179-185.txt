The variable scheme for non -stationary currents of the viscous weak -minded gas K.A. Zhukov Moscow State University. M.V. Lomonosov 1 Introduction in this work considers the linear system of equations, describing the non -stationary movement of the viscous weak -luminous barotropic gas [1] - [2] ∂p ∂t + k div (u) = 0, ∂u ∂t + ∇p = lu + f, ( 1) where L is the linear elliptical operator LU ≡ DIV (µ∇u) + ∇ ((µ + λ) divu). Above µ and λ, the coefficients of dynamic and shift viscosity are indicated, which are considered known positive constants and satisfy the conditions µ> 0, µ+ λ> 0, λ <0. The equation includes the function F (vector of external forces), which is the known function of Euler variables . A positive constant characterizing gas compressibility is indicated through K. Below we will assume that k à 1. Complete the system with the initial and boundary conditions: (p, u) | t = 0 = (p0, u0), x ∈ ω, u (t, x) = 0, (t, x) ∈ [0, T] × ∂ω. (2) 179 Different scheme for non -stationary movements. . . 2 The variable diagram denote the net analogues of the functions U and P through v = (u, v) and q, respectively. We will assume that the approximate solution of the problem (1) - (2) will be determined in the spaces of the merf functions UH and PH, in which we determine the approximation of operators ∆, DIV and ∇: ∆H: uh - → uh, divh - → p h, d̃ivh: uh - → p h, ∇h: p h - → uh, ∇̃h: p h - → uh, with the following properties (Divhvv, q) p = - (∇ hq, v) u, (d̃ivhvv, q) p = - (∇̃ hq, v) u ∀ v ∈ U H, Q ∈ P H, (3) ‖Q‖P ≤ C0 SUP Vusion | (Q, D̃IVHV) p | (—∆hv, v) 0.5 ∀q ∈ P H, (4) ∃c1: ‖d̃ivhv‖2 ≤ c1‖divhv ∀v ∈ UH. (5) Here (·, ·) p and (·, ·) Us indicate an analogue of the scalar work L2 (ω), respectively, in P H and UH. In the future, we will not write U and P indexes when this does not cause misunderstandings. Through ‖ · ‖ ‖ We will denote a discrete analogue of the norm L2 either in UH ​​or P H. We will also assume that the expression ( - ∆hvh, vH) 0.5 determines the midnight | VH | 1 in UH, the equivalent norm in UH. For a numerical solution to the problem (1) - (2), it is proposed to use the variable circuit Qt + K d̃ivhv̂ = 0, Vt + ∇̃hq̂ = Lhv̂ + F̂, (6) where lhv ≡ µ∆hv + ∇h (µ + λ) Divhvvvv ). 180 K.A. Zhukov here, then we denote v = vn, v̂ = vn+1, vt = (v̂ - v)/τ, vt̄ = (vn - vn - 1)/τ, where n = 0, 1,. . . , N (nτ = t). The initial and boundary conditions (6) are set by equalities (Q, V) | N = 0 = (P0, U0), V | ∂ωU H × ωτ = 0, (7) where the functions P0 and U0 are set in (2). Conditions (3) - (5) satisfies the following example. Let ω = [0, l1] × [0, l2], hx = l1/m1 and hy = l2/m2, ω1 = {(ihx, jhy): 0 ≤ i ≤m1, 0 ≤ j ≤m2}, ω2 = {((I + 1/2) HX, (J + 1/2) HY): 0 ≤ i ≤m1 - 1, 0 ≤ j ≤m2 - 1}. Let UH-the linear space of the vector-function v = (u, v), determined on ω1 and turning to zero on ∂ω1, and P H-the space of functions defined on ω2. We introduce scales into U H and pH by formulas (V1, V2) U = M1-1∑ I = 1 m2−1∑ J = 1 U 1J I V 1J I HXHY + M1-1∑ I = 1 m2-1 J = 1 U 2j i v 2j i hxhy, (p, q) p = m1-1∑ i = 0 m2–1∑ j = 0 p j+ 1 2 i+ 1 2 Q+ 1 2 i+ 1 2 Hxhy. Now we determine (Divhv) j+ 1 2 i+ 1 2 = u j i+ 1 - u j i hx+ v j+ 1 i - v j i hy, (d̃ivhv) j+ 1 2 i+ 1 2 = 1 2 (uji+ 1 - u j i hx ++ U J+1 i+1 - U J+1 I HX)++1 2 (VJ+1I - V J I Hy+V J+1 i+1 - V J i+1 HY), 181 Devionable scheme for non -stationary currents. . . ∀ i = 0 ,. . . , M1 - 1, j = 0 ,. . . , M2 - 1, (∇hq) ji = {qj+ 1 2 i+ 1 2 - QJ+ 1 2 I - 1 2 HX, Q+ 1 2 I+ 1 2 - QJ - 1 2 I+ 1 2 HY}, (∇̃HQ) Ji = {1 2 (QJ+ 1 2 I+ 1 2 - QJ+ 1 2 I - 1 2 HX+ Q - 1 2 I+ 1 2 - QJ - 1 2 I - 1 2 HX), 1 2 (qj+ 1 2 i+ 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 - qj - 1 2 i+ 1 2 Hy ++ Q J+ 1 2 I - 1 2 - QJ - 1 2 I - 1 2 Hy)}, ∀ i = 1,. . . , M1 - 1, j = 1 ,. . . , M2 - 1. The proof that the above example satisfies the properties (3) - (5) can be given using the technique [3] - [4]. 3 Evaluation of the error for the diverse scheme will submit the solution of the variable scheme in the form of an accurate solution and a certain amendment Q = P+ R, V = U+ W. Then for the functions R and W, we have an equation system: rt + k d̃ivhŵ = ̂̂1 + k ̂̂2, wt + ∇̃hr̂ = lhŵ + ̂̂3 (8) with initial and boundary conditions (R, W) | n = 0, 0 = (0, 0 ), w | ∂ωu h × ωτ = 0. (9) Here we introduced the following designations: ψ1 = ∂p ∂T ∂PN -1t, ψ2 = divu - d̃ivhu, ψ3 = lhu --un - ∇̃hp+ f. 182 K.A. Zhukov Theorem 3.1. Let the functions ψi (i = 1.2.3) are such that their norms are 1 k2 τ n∑ n = 1 ‖n1 ‖2, 1 k2 τ n - 2∑ n = 1 ‖n1tt̄̄ 2, 1 k ‖ψ11‖ 2, τ n∑ n = 1 ‖n2 ‖2, τ n - 2∑ n = 1 ‖ψn2tt̄̄ 2, τ n∑ n = 1 ‖n3 ‖2, τ n∑ n = 1 ‖n3 ‖2-1, τ n - 1∑ n = 1 ‖n3t‖ 2 −1, max n = 1, ..., n ‖ψn3 ‖2-1 do not exceed δ. Then, to solve the problem (8) - (9) the following assessment is true: max n = 1, ..., n ‖wn‖2 + max n = 1, ..., n ‖rn‖2 + 1 k max n = 2, ..., n ‖rn -1t ‖2 + max n = 1, ..., n | wn | 21 ≤ c (µ, (µ + λ), ω) (δ + k ‖12‖2) . Remark 3.1. If the spaces of grid functions and the approximation of operators ∆, DIV, ∇ are set as in the above example and solution of the problem (1) - (2) is smooth, then Δ = O (τ
