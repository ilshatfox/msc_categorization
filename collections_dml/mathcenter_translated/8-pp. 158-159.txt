) Classification of quasi -made Riman varieties. This work is devoted to the study of the behavior of solutions of the equation LU = σ–1 (x) Div (σ (x) ∇u) - c (x) u = 0, (1) where σ (x) and c (x ) - smooth positive functions on non -memorial riman varieties of some special species. Consider the triples (si, dθ2i, fi), where I = 1, · · · · · ·, k, si - compact Rimanovo diversity without a edge, dθ2i - metric on Si, fi - positive smooth function on SI. Variety D will be called a simple crossed work of order K if D isometrically direct work [R0, inous) × s1 · · · · × SK with a metric DS2 = ∏K I = 1 F 2 I (θi) DR 2 +∑K I = 1 Q. 2 I (r) ∏ j 6 = i f 2 j (θj) dθ 2 i. Diversity representable in the form of = b∪d1∪d2∪. . . ∪DP, where B is the compact, and DI are simple crossed works, we will call quasi -making varieties. We will say that D is L-stringed with a hyperbolic crossed work of order (k, s) if for any function χ (θ) ∈ C (s) and any continuous on s functionψ (θs+1,., Θk) on D There is a solution to the equation (1) such that U (R0, θ) = χ (θ) and limr → و (r, θ) = ψ (θs+1,., Θk). We will say that D is a l-hyperbolic crossed work, if for any function χ (θ) ∈ C (s) and any Constant C to D there is a solution to equation (1) such that U (R0, θ) = θ (θ ) and limr → → φ (r, θ) = C. 158 Let M - complete Rimanovo variety, represented in the form of the association m = b ⋃ D, where B is an arbitrary, not obligatory compact area, and D is a simple crossed work of the order K. Then the following statements are fair. Theorem 1. Let D is L-stringed with a hyperbolic crossed work of order (k, s). Then, for any continuous function ψ (θs+1,., Θk) on m, there is a solution to the equation (1) that in the region D is LIM R → mit U (R, θ) = ψ (θs+1 ,,., θk). Theorem 2. Let D is a l-hyperbolic crossed work. Then for any Constant C to M, there is a solution to the equation (1) that in the region D is Limr → → → φ U (R, θ) = C. In addition, in the work, criteria for determining the type of quasi -making diversity in terms of metric of diversity were found. S.F. Lukomsky (Saratov) about the convergence of the multiple of the multiple of the Walsha in spaces close to lux, let λ = {n = (n1, n2, ..., nd)} ⊂ nd (d ≥ 1)-family of d-somedes vectors. Consider the task of convergence of partial amounts of SN (f) (n ∈ λ) d-fold of furye-uolsha-palei functions F in spaces close to lux, depending on the properties of the family λ.
