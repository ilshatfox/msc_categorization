The task of Koshi for a half -line wave equation with a controlled senior coefficient of O. A. Belyaev 27 Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N. I. Lobachevsky, Belaeva84@rambler.ru Let the c, c, ĉ, t1, t2 - non -negative numbers, 0 <c ≤ c, π ≡ {t ≡ {t1, t2} ∈ R2: ct1 ≤ t2 ≤ t2 - CT1, 0 ≤ T1 ≤ T1}. Consider the controlled task of the Cossa LC [x] ≡ x′t1t1 - (c (t1)) 2 x′T2t2 = g (t, x (t)), t ∈ π, (1) x (0, t2) = 0, x ′ t1 (0, t2) = 0 with t2 ∈ [0, t2], (2) where g (t, l): π × r → r is the specified function, c (t1): [0, t1 ] → R - management. The functions G (T, L) and G′L (T, L) satisfy the conditions of karateodori and are limited on any limited set. Permissible control from class D are absolutely continuous on the segment [0, T1] of functions that satisfy the inequalities with it C ≤ c (t1) ≤ c, | C ′ (T1) | ≤ ĉ. Put γ ≡ {t ∈ ∂π: t1 = 0}; J [x, c, η, z] ≡ π π {x′t1η ′ t1 - c2x′t2 type + zη} dt for x ∈ W 12 (π), c ∈ D, η ∈ W 12 (π), z ∈ Lux (π). The solution (generalized) of the problem (1), (2) that meets the control of c ∈ D, we call the function x ∈ W 1inger (π), for which for any η ∈ W 12 (π) such that η (t) = 0 with t ∈ ∂π \ γ, we have J [x, c, η, g] = 0. Such a definite solution is naturally called global. Each management meets no more than one global decision. Let ω (π) are many of all those departments, each of which is responsible for the global solution to the problem (1), (2). We indicate further through AC [z] the solution from W 1 fine (π) of the Koshi problem with condition (2) for the equation lc [x] = z (t), t ∈ π ∈ D, z ∈ Lux (π). For each C ∈ D, the linear operator AC [·]: lip (π) → linger (π) is limited. We formulate the main result - the general theorem about the conditions from the 28 storage of global resolving the problem of the Koshi (1), (2) with outrage. Theorem. For any C0 ∈ ω (π) there is Δ> 0 that if c ∈ D and ‖AC –AC0‖LU (π) → Luit (π) <δ, then C ∈ ω (π). The theorem has been proved by the methods of work [1] by the information of the problem (1), (2) to Voltaurre to the functional equation. Consequence. For any C0 ∈ ω (π) there is Δ> 0 that if c ∈ D and ‖C - C0‖c [0, T1] + ‖ ′ - c′0‖l et [0, t1] <Δ, then c ∈ ω (π). The work was done under the guidance of prof. V.I. Sumin.

Such tasks were studied at one time by S. A. Chaplygin, V.V. Golubev. The task of the flow of a circle with a whirlwind was solved by A. I. Nekrasov [1, §§ 7, 8] and M. T. Nugin [2, § 16].
