Amazing extensions of the fields of algebraic numbers amazing expansion of the field of algebraic numbers is any existential closed field in the classroom of all counting underpants of the rings of the adels of this field. The main properties of such fields are the justice for them of the local-global principle of Hasse for entire points of diversity and the properties of maximumness (lack of their own algebraic extensions). The elementary theory of such fields is complete and permitted. Algebraic and theoretico model properties of amazing extensions will be described and their application is indicated to build an effective version of the global theory of classes of classes. M.I. Kuznetsov (N. Novgorod, kuznets@unn.ac.ru) O. A. Mular (N. Novgorod, milyar@mail.nnov.ru) Maximum Zagalges and Automorphism Algebr Frank over the Characteristics field 3 are considered a series of simple exceptional Algebr Lee is a series of algebr franc t (m), m ∈ N ([[1, 2, 3, 4]). Algebra Frank T (M) = T has a z2 grading: t = t0 ⊕ t1, where t0 = w + sl (u) ⊗ o, t1 = u ⊗ ω1, u is the vector space of dimension 2, o (1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: m), W = w (1: m) - whether algebra of special differentiations of algebra O. Theorem 1. Let m - maximum maximum maximum permanence 3 in T (M). Then either m = t (0)-the standard maximum subpalgra, or m resolved and t/m-an ignorant M-module. Theorem 2. Let g = aut t-a group of automorphisms algebra t, g = alge g-whether the group G, g = g0 ⊕ g1 is the corresponding z2-grading, then g0 ∼ = SL (u) ⊗o + line aut w, g1 ∼ = t1, (3), 17
