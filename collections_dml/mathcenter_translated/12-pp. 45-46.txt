The ultimate emptyness of projective modules of the Nal with half -eyed group algebrays M.F. Nashutdinov Kazan State University E-Mail: Marat.nasrutdinov@ksu.ru examines the group algebra KG Group G above the field K and unitary right fashion; Ty above this algebra. We will be covered in 45 through j (p) Pzhskobson's radical to R. R. The following question is studied. Let KG be a half -haired ring, p - non -tectative kg. Chodul. Will Du of course be generated by the module P, if the factor is the cap p = r / j (p) is finally generated? Note:-1, that d.1, the arbitrary semi-lover KO: that answer is negative (see [1]). Positive answer to the set: a rhinous question by. "Ilident in particular cases. The theorem is shown. Let the CS -half -coloking algebra, rush, ~ tudul, such, that the factormodul p = = r (r (r (p (r. ) Of course, generated. Then the module R is a horse â€¢ It is generated in the following cases: 1) the field to the estate (rno is Su.ltma of squares not equal to zero): 2) K = C - the field of computers. 1x -record.: 3) Group G is allowed by the group; 4) Group G locally Ko'n.echna. The work was performed with the financial support of the RFFIF (project 99-01-00469). Literature 1. Gerasimov V.N., Sakhaev I.I. counterthery.
