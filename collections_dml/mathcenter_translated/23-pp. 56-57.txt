) Polokal group alebra, let R = KG - a semi -coloking group algebra over an algebraically closed field. We will denote the Ring Ring Ring Ring Ran Ran Radical to the group (relative to multiplication) g = = {g + j (kg) | g ∈ G} and the homomorphism of groups θ: g → G. It is clear that θ is epimorphism. If the orders G ∈ G are not equal to zero in K, then θ is an attachment. With chck = 0, using Bernside Theorem of the limb of course, of course, 58 generated periodic linear group, we get (in another way) a known result (see, for example, [1]) about the local limb of the group G.

Permyakov (Nizhny Novgorod, dpermyakov@rambler.ru) differentiation of classic algebrics Lee over the field of characteristics 2 in the work describes the differentiation of classical algebrics Lee over the field of characteristics 2. For a simple algebra of the field of characteristics 0 Any differentiation is internal. Under the classic algebra Lee above the field of non-equal characteristics, we understand the algebra of whether a simple algebraic group or its factor-algebra in the center. Classic algebras of the type AN, BN, CN, DN above the field characteristics 2. Their properties are largely different from the properties of the corresponding algebra over the field characteristics 0: In particular, external differentiations appear. In the work, the dimensions of the spaces of external differentiations of all the algebra considered were found, and the databases of these spaces were built. Theorem 1. Let l-algebra type an above the field F characteristics 2, n ≥ 1, l-factor-algebra L in the center. If n = 1, then DIM H1 (L) = DIM H1 (L, L) = 4. If n = 3, then Dim H1 (L) = 1, DIM H1 (L) = 7. If n is even, then h1 (l, l) = h1 (l, l) = 0. If n> 3 is odd, then Dim H1 (L, L) = DIM H1 (L) = 1. Theorem 2 . Let L-algebra type BN above the field F characteristics 2, n ≥ 2, l-factor-algebra L in the center. If n = 2, then Dim H1 (L) = 5, Dim H1 (L, L) = 6. If n = 3, then Dim H1 (L) = 1, DIM H1 (L) = 16. 59
