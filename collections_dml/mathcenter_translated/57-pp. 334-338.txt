UDC 517.956.223 The modified task of Riman -Gilbert for generalized analytical functions and its application E.V. Tyurikov1 1 Etyurikov@hotmail.com; The Don State Technical University has found a criterion for unconditional resolving for one class of the tasks of the membrane theory of convex membranes. Key words: convex membrane, the task of Riman-Gilbert, the index of the boundary condition. 1. The setting of the problem r. Let S - a single -legged surface with a piece of smooth edge l = n⋃ j = 1 l J and angular points PI (I = 1,., N). It is assumed that S is the inner part of the surface S0 of strictly positive Gaussian curvature of the regularity class w 3, r, r> 2, and each of the smooth arcs L J belongs to the class C 1, ε, 0 <ε <1. We set along L along Line -theth of the vector field r = {α (s), β (s)}, which allows ruptures of the first kind at points p j, with the tangent and normal components of α (s), β (s) (α2+β2 = 1, β≥ 0 ) where s is the natural parameter, the functions α (s), β (s) are the helderovs on each of the arcs l j. E.V. Tyurikov 335 Enter the designations: j - display of surface S0 to the complex plane Z = x + i Y, set by the choice of conjugated isometric parameterization (x, y) on S0, D = J (S) - limited in the complex plane Z, a single -bond region with the border γ = n⋃ j = 1 j (l j) and angular points qi = j (pi). Consider the following task (task r): find the integrated solution of w (z) the equation (bending function [1] of the surface s) ww̄ (z) −b (z) w̄ (z) = f (z), z ∈ D , (1) under a given boundary condition of Riman -Gilbert Re {λ (ζ) W (ζ)} = γ (ζ), (2) where λ (ζ) = s (ζ) [β (ζ) t (ζ) −α (ζ) s (ζ)], (3) s (ζ) = s1 (ζ)+ i s2 (ζ), t (ζ) = t1 (ζ)+ i t2 (ζ), i 2 = - - - - 1, si (i = 1, 2)-the coordinates of the concerns to γ ​​qta at the point ζ, ti (i = 1, 2)-the coordinates of the direction of the direction on the plane, which is the J-image of the tangential direction at the surface at the point J-1 (ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ), the values ​​of the functions α (ζ), β (ζ) coincide with the value of the functions α, β at the corresponding point C = j -1 (ζ), the function γ (ζ) of the helder on each of the arcs γ j = j (l j) , w z̄ = 1 2 (wx + i wy), b (z), f (z) -specified in the area D of the class LR (D), r> 2. At the same time, W 1, R -regulatory in the area D Solutions W (Z), continuously continuing on L, with the exception of the qi rupture points, in the vicinity of which there is an estimate ∣∣W (z) ∣∣ <const · ∣ ∣ ∣z ∣qi ∣∣-α J, 0 <α J <1. The task R under the conditions of the smoothness of the border l and the continuity of the vector-function R (M) of the point m ∈ L was set and investigated by I. N. Vekua in [2] . A case of a piece of border l and a piece-line vector fields R of a special species was studied by the author in [3]. For arbitrary pieces of reference vector fields and a spherical surface S0, the task R is studied in [4]. Of greatest interest from the point of view of applications to the membrane theory of shells is the case of a piece of line-terminal vector fields setting a continuous field of directions along L. for such fields is built (see [4]) an algorithm for finding an index of the boundary condition (2), the implementation of which is arbitrarily arbitrary. The given boundaries does not allow you to get an effective formula for its calculation. Under some additional conditions, on the “geometry” of the boundaries and field of directions in the vicinity of the corner points, effective formulas for the index were found in [5]. In this work, such a formula was obtained for a fairly wide class of borders and an arbitrary continuous field of directions. 2. Problem R for symmetrical domes.
