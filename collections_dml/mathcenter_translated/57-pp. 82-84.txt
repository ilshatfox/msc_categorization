UDC 517.5 Filtration of two-dimensional trigonometric arrays by amplitude-phase operators D.G. Vasilchenkova1 1 darya.vasilchenkova@mail.ru; Vladimir State University. A.G. and N.G. Stocking rooms are considered the task of highlighting harmonics in the nodes of a uniform two -dimensional mesh from the trigonometric polynomial of two variables (two -dimensional trigonometric array) set on the same grid). The method is based on the amplitude-phase operators (AFO) apparatus, which are imposed on such signals that differ from each other with amplitudes and initial phase shifts. Keywords: amplitude-phase operator, two-dimensional arrays, harmonication. Let the whole s ≥ 2, µ ≥ 1, n = sµ - 1, m = (s + 1) µ and many nodes λ (0) j: = 2π (j −1)/m, j = 1, m. Put TN (t) = a0 + n∑ k = 1 τk (t), τk (t): = ak coskt + bk sinkt. λ j = λ (0) j +rα, ω = −2cos 2πα S +1, x j = 2cos (λ jµ) +ω m, α = 1, S, where the shift is Rα = 0 with even α and rα = π /m - with odd. Then the action of the AF takes the type ([1,2]) τµ (λk)+a0 · ω = m∑ j = 1 x j · tn (λk λ j). Due to the frequency of TN, the theorem is obtained from here. Let µ≥ 1, s ≥ 2, n = sµ - 1, m = (s +1) µ and the values ​​of the polynomial TN (t) are specified on the uniform grid of the nodes {λ (0) j} of the segment [0.2π]. Then the exact values ​​of the ward of the monika τµ at points λk = λ (0) k+rα are calculated by the formula: τµ (λk)+a0 · ω = k∑ j = 1 x j · tn (λ (0) k - j+1) +M∑ j = k+1 x j · tn (λ (0) m+k - j+1), α = 1, s. From here you can get the formula for highlighting harmonics for trigonometric polynomials of two variables. Read more, even in the nodes of a flat uniform D.G.
