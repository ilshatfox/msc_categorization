.) Static system of particles in the stationary gravitational field Yu. G. Ignatiev, R.F. Miftakhov Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University, Kazan, rustem_miftah@yahoo.ru in [1], [2] shows that the correct introduction of the scaly Under the Imotion of particles in the relativistic theory of gravity, it leads to a change in the effective masses of particles: m ∗ = | m+ qφ |, where q is the scalar charge of particles, φ - the potential of the scalar field. Consider the resting degenerated gas in a stationary gravitational field, which is possible with l ă gik = 0; Φ cil = 0. With this gravitational field, the system is described by only one 112 self -compiled equation of the type of gluine -city: 2φ + µ2sφ - 1 6 rface + λ 3 φ3 + r 6 φ = = −4π�qm 3ρ3 2π2 [√ 1 - ă2 - ă2 ln √ 1 - ă2 + 1 | ă | ] The total potential energy is EXAR = ES + EIN = Q2M4ρ2 {α2 (ρ moon - 1) 2+ + 1 8π2 [(2 - ctor) √ 1 - ă2 - ising √ 1 - ₽2 + 1 | ctor | - - ((2ρ2 - 1) √ ρ2 - 1 ρ4 - 1 ρ4 ln √ ρ2 - 1 + ρ)]}. 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 t Fig. 1. The dependence of the Energy Graph on the parameter ρ from Fig. 1 shows that all the graphs cross the line of zero the howl of energy, and their minimums lie in the negative field. Thus, the introduction of scalar interaction leads 113 to an effective mechanism for regulating the equation equation, which may be important in the cosmological situation. L and T R A T R A 1.

Lobachevsky issues of the general theory of boundary tasks were discussed in the labor of M.I. Vishika, L. Hurmander, A.A. Dezin and other authors. These issues are directly related to the concept of right extensions of differential operations. In these Ra Bots, in particular, the existence of correct tasks and correct extensions was proved. It is of interest in the structure of structural schemes of the correct extensions of the differential operations. This work discusses one of the approaches associated with the method of orthogonal television, different from the approach considered by A. As an example of the application of this scheme, we consider 114
