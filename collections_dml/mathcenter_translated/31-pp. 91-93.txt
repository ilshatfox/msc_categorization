. The extrapolation description of the Martsinkevich spaces and the convergence of the orthogonal series K.V. Lykov Samara University work is a continuation of research [1] - [4] and is devoted to the applications of the theory of extrapolation. Some classes of symmetrical spaces are considered on [0, 1], the norm in which is determined by LP-Norms. Let F - Banakhovo ideal space of functions defined on [1, و). Then you can consider the set of LF all functions X (t), for which cil = lection (p): = ‖x‖p ∈ F. It is easy to show that this is a set (with the usual identification of functions equal to almost everywhere) becomes a symmetrical space, if we determine the norm ‖X‖‖LF: = ‖ă‖f in it. If w = w (p) is a positive function on [1, least), then through f (w) we will denote the space of the functions x = x (t) with the norm ‖x‖‖f (w) = ‖x · w‖f. Theorem 1. Let m (∗) - the space of the Marcinkevich with the fundamental function ∗ (t), m0 (gment) - its separatic part, ∗ (t) = t/gment (t). Then the following conditions are equivalent: 91 1. M (∗) = LF for some F; 2. M (gment) = lf ∗, where firon = lday (1/‖ accord); 3. m0 (gment) = LF1 for some F1; 4. M0 (∗) = LF ∗0, where F ng 0 = C0 (1/‖ accord), C0 - the space of functions x (t) of lux such that limt → ger x (t) = 0; 5. There is C> 0 that ∗ (t) ≤ c the p≥1 t1/p ‖ phone, 0 <t ≤ 1. (1) if ∗ (t) satisfies (stronger (more stronger than ( 1)) Condition ∗ (t) ≤ αicle (t2), (2) then (see [1]) c 1 ‖ship ≤ ð (2 - p) ≤ c 1‖ accord, and therefore M0 (gment) = lg accord, (3) where gwor0 = c0 (onic (2 −p)). Theorem 2. Let e ​​= lf, and the system {xn} و = 1 is minimal and full in E. Then, if for all x ∈ E and natural n ∥∥∥∥n n = 1 x ∗ n (x) xn ∥∥∥∥ p ≤ cp‖x‖p, where {x ∗ n} is a system related to {xn}, then for any x ∈ E ∑icle n = 1 x ∗ n (x) xn converges to x In space E1 = LF (1/CP). 92 using theorem 2 and ratio (3) can be obtained, for example, the following statement. The investigation 1. Let СU satisfy the condition (2), {ψn (t)} gern = 1 - an orthonomated system and for ∀x ∈ M0 (∗) and natural n ∥∥∥∥n n = 1 cn (x) ψn ∥∥∥∥ p ≤ cp‖x‖p, where CN (x) is the factors of Fourier function X (t). If {ψn (t)} is full of m0 (gment), then for ∀x ∈ M0 (∗) a row ∑icle = 1 cn (x) ψn converges X in space m0 (∗1), where ∗1 (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) ∗ (t)/ln (2/t). The condition of the investigation is satisfied, in particular, the trigonometric system and the WALSHA system. Similar statements take place for the spaces of Lorentz. Close results (for the spaces of Lorentz) are proved in the work [5]. L and T R A T RALTAKIN S.V., Lykov K.V.
