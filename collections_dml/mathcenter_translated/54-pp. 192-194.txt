UDC 517.95 On the convergence of a piece-polynomial solutions of the equation of the minimum surface of A.A. Klyachin1, A.G. Panchenko2 1 klyachin-aa@yandex.ru; Volgograd State University 2 Alice1051@ya.ru; Volgograd State University The article discusses the concept of a piece of line-approximate approximate solution of the equation of the minimum surface set over the triangulated area. The issue of approximation of the functionality of the area in this class of surfaces and the convergence of such solutions with the desire to zero fineness of the triangular mesh is being studied. In particular, the uniform convergence of a piece of line and quadratic solutions has been proved and an assessment of the speed of this convergence through the step of the grid h is indicated. Keywords: a piece of quadratic function, surface area, approximation of functionality, triangulation, minimum surface. Let the polygonal limited area ω r2 be set. Consider some breakdown of this polygon into the non -deleted triangles T1, T2, ..., TN. Let m1, m2, ..., mm - all the peaks of these triangles. We will assume that none of the Mi points is the inner point of any of the sides of the triangles. To build a piece-cost function, we add to the existing set of the vertices M1, M2, ..., mm all the middle of the sides of the triangles T1, T2, ..., TN. Donsteled many points are designated through m1, m2, ..., mm, mm +1, ..., mr. For an arbitrary set of numbers U1, U2, ..., um, um+1, ..., ur, determine the piece-quadratic function u: ω 7 → r so that u (mi) = ui, i = 1.2, ..., R and function u (x, y) = ak11x2 + ak12x y + ak22Y2 + AK10X + AK01Y + AK00 on each triangle TK, K = 1, ..., N. This function will be continuous in ω, and in each triangle TK its gradient ∇u is determined. Therefore, the area of ​​the function of the function U is calculated by the sum of s (u) = n∑ k = 1 ï tk √ 1+ | ∇u | 2d xd y. We denote through QR0 the subspace of the space R R R r r r (U1, U2, ..., UR), for which UI = 0, if mi ∈ ∂ω. Note that in this case, A.A. Klyachin, A.G. Panchenko 193 A powerful piece-quadratic function takes zero values ​​on the border of the ∂ω area. We set the task of finding such a vector U ∗ ∈QR0, on which the minimum of the area S (U +∗) is achieved, i.e., the task n∑ k = 1 ï tk √ 1+ | ∇ (u +ship) | 2d xd y 7 → min, u ∈qr0, (1) where onic ∈C (ω). We argue that the task (1) has the only solution U ∗. Let f (x) ∈ C 3 (ω) ∩ c (ω̄). We approximate this function with a piece of quadratic function F q (x, y) such that f q (mi) = f (mi), i = 1, ..., r. Suppose that the solution of the minimum surface ∂ ∂x (fx√ 1+ | ∇ f | 2)+∂ ∂y (fy√ 1+ | ∇ f | 2) = 0, f ∈C 3 (ω) is set. , such as f | ∂ω = onic | ∂ω. Just as in [1] the following assessment of the gradient of the approximate decision was obtained | ∇u ∗ (x) | ≤c (p0, α), where P0 = max {Sup ω | ∇ f |, SUP ω | ∇ices |} and α = S (F Q) —S (F) MIN K V (TK). With the help of this assessment of the gradient, a piece-quadratic solution, we have established the following statement. TEOPEM 1. LAW F (x) ∈C 3 (ω) ∩C (ω̄)-the solution of the equation of the minimum surface, f | ∂ω = onic ∂ω, and u ∗-a piece of quadratic function, which is a solution to the problem (1) . Suppose P0 = SUP ω | ∇ F | < +Urb and P1 = SUP ω | ∇U ∗ |. Then max ω | f q - (u ∗+gment) | ≤ 4p 4/3 (s (f q) —s (u ∗+С) λ (ω) π) 1 4, where p = max {1, p0, p1} and λ (ω) is the main frequency of the region ω. To remove the main result, we assume that there is a follower of the triangulations tq = {t qk} nq k = 1 and hq = max1≤k≤nq di am (t q) → 0 with Q → urb. We denote the minimum angle of triangulation triangles through θq. And we will assume that θq does not strive for zero at q → urb. We denote the corresponding piece-quadratic solution of the equation of the minimum surface through U ∗ Q. Then it is true 2. The sequence U ∗ Q conges evenly to F Na on q → urb. At the same time, SUP ω | f (x, y) −u ∗ q (x, y) | = O (h3/4Q). 194 Materials of the International School-Conference Note that a similar theorem was proved for a piece of line-line solutions in [2] with an evaluation of the error O (H1/4).
