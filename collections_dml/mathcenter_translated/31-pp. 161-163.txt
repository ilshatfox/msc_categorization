. Integral representation of the solution for the degenerating b-elliptic equation of the 2nd kind A. Sh. Khismatullin Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University, airatka@list.ru Let d+-the final area in E ++ 2, limited by the γ+ curve and γ1 and γ0 segments and γ0 coordinate axes OX and Oy; D+E = E ++ 2 / D̄+. In the work, an integral representation of the solution is built for the degenerating b -elliptical equation of the type EB (u) = bxu + y m∂2u/∂y2 = 0, (EB) where bx = ∂2/∂x2 + (2k/x) ∂/∂x - Operator Bessel, M> 4, K> M/(2 (M - 2)) - constant. This equation is leaded to the form βm -4bαv + ∂ 2V/∂β2 = 0. (1) is known [1] that the fundamental solution of this equation with a feature at the point (x0, y0) in the coordinates X and Y can be presented in the form of ε (X, Y; X0, Y0) = AC2K γ (2–2γ) γ (K) (m - 2) m - 2 (yy0) m 4 (xx0) −k 4γ (k + 1– γ) γ (1 - γ) × 163
