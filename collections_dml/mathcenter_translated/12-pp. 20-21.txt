Closed ideals in some algebras of the whole functions of N.T. Akhtyamov Bashkir state university, g. Ufa akhtyatov@mail. RB. Ru Consider the space of the chain function of the final M-type n ,,. = {fe n (c): AFR (F) ~ CEM (BR)} with TOPO: Yugia of the Includive pre -Jet of spaces n ~, = {f (z) e (c): llfll = sup mr ((f)) <x}. R ETP NR shows that in the case of T (1 ·) = EXP (RP), any non -tribunal is closed ideas. 1 in the NT space - gabe. Let Z - sequence in C, 1 1.
