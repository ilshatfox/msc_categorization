) The differentiation of classic algebrists Lee over the field of characteristics 2 in the work describes the differentiation of classic algebrians Lee over the field of characteristics 2. For a simple algebra Lee above the field, characteristics 0 Any differentiation is internal. Under the classic algebra Lee above the field of non-equal characteristics, we understand the algebra of whether a simple algebraic group or its factor-algebra in the center. Classic algebras of the type AN, BN, CN, DN above the field characteristics 2. Their properties are largely different from the properties of the corresponding algebra over the field characteristics 0: In particular, external differentiations appear. In the work, the dimensions of the spaces of external differentiations of all the algebra considered were found, and the databases of these spaces were built. Theorem 1. Let l-algebra type an above the field F characteristics 2, n ≥ 1, l-factor-algebra L in the center. If n = 1, then DIM H1 (L) = DIM H1 (L, L) = 4. If n = 3, then Dim H1 (L) = 1, DIM H1 (L) = 7. If n is even, then h1 (l, l) = h1 (l, l) = 0. If n> 3 is odd, then Dim H1 (L, L) = DIM H1 (L) = 1. Theorem 2 . Let L-algebra type BN above the field F characteristics 2, n ≥ 2, l-factor-algebra L in the center. If n = 2, then Dim H1 (L) = 5, Dim H1 (L, L) = 6. If n = 3, then Dim H1 (L) = 1, DIM H1 (L) = 16. 59 If n> 3, then Dim H1 (L) = 1, Dim H1 (L) = 2N + 2. Theorem 3. Let l - algebra type CN above the field F characteristics 2, n ≥ 3, L is the factor of Algebra L in the center. Then DIM H1 (L, L) = 2N + 1, DIM H1 (L, L) = 1. Theorem 4. Let l-algebra type DN above the field F characteristics 2, n ≥ 4, l-factor-algebra L in the center . If n is odd, then Dim H1 (L) = 1, Dim H1 (L, L) = 2N + 1. If N> 4 - even, then DIM H1 (L) = 2, DIM H1 (L , L) = 2n + 2. If n = 4, then Dim H1 (L) = 2, Dim H1 (L) = 26. The work was performed with financial support for the RFFIF (Project No. 02-0100725). M. L. Platonov (Tyumen, Platonov@tgu.ru) several results about E-prisoners and P-dedication of computable numbering, let µ and ν-two computable numberings of the set S. They say that µ e-prisoner (p-dwarf) to ν, if there is such a recursive number W (the general meshursive function F) that (∀S) (µ - 1 (s) = {x: (∃y) (〈x, y〉 ∈ W ∧ y ∈ (s (s )}), respectively (∀S) (µ - 1 (s) = {x: (∃y) (y ∈ Df (x) ∧dy ⊆ ν - 1 (s)}), where 〈x, y〉 - Cantor number of the pair (x, y) of natural numbers from N, and DN-the canonical number of the final subset n. The existence of computable families of the final sets and the overall functions that do not have e-main numbering. In the work [1] it is noted that there is a calculated numbering Family {{0, 1}, {0, 1, 2}, {3}, {0, 3}}, to which the P-Vydima is inexplicable. It is further proved that: (1) if some numbering p-provar is computable The numbering of the three-element family of recursive and permitted sets, then it is computable; 60
