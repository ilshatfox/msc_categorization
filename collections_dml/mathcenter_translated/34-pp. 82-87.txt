The projectivization of the conformal model of the stratification of the hemisphere of M.V. Dyachkov Kazan State University will consider the 3-dimensional unit unit unprofitable algebra of the second type [1]. It has a structure of the customs of the customs of the rank of rank 2. The stratification of the hemisphere S2 (1), determined by the subparagraph of double numbers, is considered in [2]. We build a conformal model of this hemisphere S2 (1) to study its main stratification according to the sub -hepatre of double numbers. To do this, we expand the semi -evclidic space to the design space p 3. We introduce homogeneous coordinates (y0: y1: y2: y3), assuming XI = yi/y3, I = 0, 1, 2. Then the equation of quadric s2 (1): x20 - X21 = 1 sets in P 3 the material cone y20 - y21 - y23 = 0, (1) attributed to the canonical reper (E0, E1, E2, E3). Stereographic projection of the plane P 2: y0 = 0 per cone (1) from the pole N (1: 0: 0: 1) should be considered only when y3 6 = 0. Therefore, taking the line y3 = 0 for the unreasonable and introducing Descartes coordinates U1 = Y1/Y3, U2 = Y2/Y3, we get in the plane y0 = 0 semi -Euclidean structure A2 with a linear element DS20 = −DU21. The cone crosses the plane A2 by pair of imaginary parallel lines U21 = −1. We normalize the cone (1) auto -polar, taking straight ligaments with a fixed center E0 for normal p. E0, and for normal the second kind of PII - their polar straight lines belonging to the planes Y0 = 0. The projective plane P 2 is also normalized. 84 Since the point E0 is selected constant, the derivative equations of the normalized plane P 2: Y0 = 0 contains only two equations ∂IX = yi + lix, ∇jyi = ljyi + pjix. We set the normal PII with the reference points yi = ∂ix - lix. The decompositions ∂jyi = ljyi + γ s ijys + pijx determine projectively Euclidean connectivity γkij and tensor Pij. Thus, considering the structure of the semi -European plane with rectangular coordinates UI in the A2, we get a conformal model of a polar normalized project of P 2 with a linear element DS2 = DU21/(1 + U 2 1) 2. The resulting non -Euclidean space is conformally semi -sabbath to the bottom plane. The metric teaser Gij and the curvature tensor r r kji in this connection is cowardly constant. The plane P 2 has constant curvature. Consider the stratification of this space, determined by the subparagraph of double numbers. The planes (y0 + y1) v-y2 = 0, where v ∈ R, set the equations of layers in the projective space p 3. Having examined them together with the equation of the cone (1), the 1-parametric family of layers of stratification on Kos Nus. With a stereographic display, it will go into 1 parametric parametric parameter U2 = −1/2V (U1 - 1) 2 with a top at a point (1.0), symmetrical relatively straight U1 = 1. L and T R A T R A T RAL 1 .

Eliseev, Nizhny Novgorod State Technical University, it is proved that automorphism ffic with the property xwor (x-1) ∈ STS-1 ⇒ X ∈ T (T is the subgroup of ) it acts only in groups E6 (Q), 2E6 (Q), when Q is odd. Groups for which there is non-trivial automorphism with a indicated property, are further called ∗ groups. Information about them can be found in [1, 2, 3]. The structure introduced in this way is inherited when the transition to ∗ anvarian under groups and factor groups according to ∗ invariant normal divisors. In subsequent considerations, it is often applied to the painted C -n -structure: let T ∈ T, C = C (T) and N = N (<T>). It is easy to check that N1 ⊂ C, so N and C lead to the same quasi -group. Therefore, (n: t) = (n1: n1 ∩ t) or (t: t ∩n1) = (n: n1), and in T contains an element of a simple order, dividing the index (n: c). In particular, if t ⊂ c, then N and C must match. 86 At the final stages of evidence, the following results are used. Theorem 1 [3], if in the compositional series of the group π there are insoluble (simple) factors of types for which vent the deo Rema has already been proven (we have LN, SP2N, UN, ON), then there are involution in T. Theorem 2 [2]. If ∗2 = 1 in ∗ group π = π1, then π resolves. The proof passes according to the following scheme. 1. It is known [4] that the automorphism of a simple group cannot be regular, so | t | > 1. 2. We prove that there are semi -free elements in T. 3. We prove that in t there is involution. 4. We prove the identity gment. Drying 1. T contains semi -free elements. In case of proof of this proposal, information from [6] about the conjugation of uniples with their degrees was used significant about at once. In group E6 (Q), when considering the classes of these elements, three cases are distinguished: a) CH (K) = 3; C) q ≡ 1 (mod
