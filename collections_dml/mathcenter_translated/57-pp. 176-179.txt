KECHKO1 1 ekechko@gmail.com; Gomel State University named after Francis Skorina for the system {eλ j z} 3 j = 1, where {λ j} 3 j = 1-various and excellent Corones complex numbers, found the rate of desking of the approximations of the 2nd kind of. The formulated by the results of the previously obtained by O. Poron, D. Braess, A.I. Aptekarev, A.P. Starovoitovo and other keywords: joint approximation to the case, approximation of the Hermit-a week of the 2nd kind, asymptotic equality. Consider the system f⃗ = {eλ j z} k j = 1, where {λ j} k j = 1 - various no -equal kom compression numbers. For the index n ∈N0 = n∪ {0} and multi -foster m⃗ = (m1, m2,., MK), m j ∈N0 there are polynomials QN, m⃗ (z) = qn, m⃗ (z; f⃗) ̸≡ 0 , P jn, m⃗ (z) = p j n, m⃗ (z; f⃗), j = 1.2 ,. . . , k; Deg QN, M⃗ é M, Deg P Jn, M⃗ é n J, J = 1.2 ,. . . , k, satisfying the conditions r j n, m⃗ (z; f⃗) = qn, m⃗ (z) eλ j z З П jn, m⃗ (z) = o n+| m | +1), z → 0, (1) where | m | = ∑ki = 1 mi, n j = n+| m | —m j, j = 1.2 ,. . . , k. Thus, the only rational functions π j n, m⃗ (z) = π j n, m⃗ (z; f⃗) = p j n, m⃗ (z) qn, m⃗ (z), j = 1.2 ,. . . , k, which are called approximations of the Hermit-Pad 2nd genus (or joint approximations of the case), and polynomials QN, M⃗ (Z), P 1 N, M⃗ (Z) ,. . . , P k n, m⃗ (z)-polynomials of the Hermit-Pad 2nd genus. The diagonal case corresponds to a set of indices n = m1 =. . . = mk. The polynomials of the Hermit-a parade of the 2nd kind for the system f⃗ = {eλ j z} k j = 1 were introduced by S. Ermit in [1], devoted to the evidence of the transcendence of the number E. They also found obvious expressions for polynomials and residual function that satisfy the conditions (1): if f⃗ = {eλ j z} k j = 1, then qn, m⃗ (z) = zn+| m | +1 (n+| m |) ! ∫ +urb 0 [xn k∏ i = 1 (x − λ) mi] e - xzd x, (2) p j n, m⃗ (z) = e λ j z zn +| m | +1 (n +| m |) ! ∫ +φ λ j [xn k∏ i = 1 (x –λi) mi] e - xzd x, (3) r n, m⃗ (z) = e λ j z zn +| m | +1 (n +| m | m | m | )! ∫ λ j 0 [xn k∏ i = 1 (x −λi) mi] e --xzd x, j = 1.2 ,. . . , k.

Pada [2] and O. Peron [3] proved that on the compacts from C of the fractions πn, m (z) they even converge to EZ with n/m γ, 0 é γ é +و γ imes and with n +m → ∞, respectively. Based on the result of the numerical experiment, G. Meinardus formulated the hypothesis of the asymptotic behavior of the difference EZ −πn, M (Z). Its decision was received by D. Braess [4], proving the following statement: for any complex Z at n +m → ger ez −πn, m (z) = (−1) m! N! E2mz/(n +m) (n +m) (n +m) (n +m) (n +m) (n +m) +m)! (N +m +1)! z n+m+1 (1+o (1)). E. M. Nikishin was given the task of studying the convergence of joint approximations to the case for the system f⃗ = {eλ j z} k j = 1, where λ j are different complex numbers that are different from zero. The solution to this problem was obtained by A. I. Aptekarev [5]: for any z ∈C for n +| → +ger qn, m⃗ (z) = exp  ∑ ∑k j = 1λ j n +| m | m | m | z   (1+o (1)), (4) and fractions π j n, m⃗ (z; eλ j ă) converge to eλ j z evenly on compacts in C. Note that with the exception of very particular cases (see. [6–8]), it is still not known what is the rate of convergence of the approximations of Ermit-a parade of the 2nd kind (for more details see [8]). In this work, theorems about the asymptotic function of the residual function and about the speed of the descending of the approximations of the Hermit-a parade of the 2nd kind, are also embracing, including the non -iagonal case. The methods used in the study of the asymptotic properties of the diagonal approximations of the Hermit - Pad, in the general case, are not so effective. Therefore, when proof of theorems, a new approach is used, which is based on Taylor's theorem and heuristic considerations underlying the methods of Laplace and Pass (see [9]). We formulate the main results. Theorem 1.
