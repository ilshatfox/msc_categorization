The stability and admissibility of the pair (C0, C0) for linear variable equations is considered a linear variable equation xn = n∑ k = 0 ankxk + fn, n ≥ 0, (1) where {xn}, {fn} - sequence of elements from CM, Ank -M × m-matrixes with complex elements. It is assumed that the matrices (I - Ann) are reversible at n ≥ 0 (i - a single matrix). We introduce the operator ã, which each sequence X puts in line the sequence ã = {n∑ k = 0 ankxk}. Determination 1. Equation (1) steady (asymptotically stable), if with any free member f such that SUP n≥0 ‖fn‖cm <→ 0 with n → ∞) Solution X equation (1) satisfies the condition of SUP n mid ‖xn‖cm <و (xn → 0 for n → و). Determination of 2. A pair of spaces (x, y) is permissible regarding the equation (1) if, with any f ∈ X, the solution x ∈ Y. Determination of 3. A pair of spaces (x, y) is permissible relative to the operator ã if ã (x) ⊂ y, i.e. If ã (x) ⊂ y for any sequence x ∈ X. The following statement is true (cf. [1]). Theorem. Let the equation (1) steady, and steam (C0, C0) 26
