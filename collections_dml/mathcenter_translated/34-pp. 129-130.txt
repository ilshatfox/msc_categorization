. Radii of convergence for the rows exhibits O. A. Krivosheev Bashkir State University, Ufa, Putinbsu@yandex.ru Let λ ′ - a sequence of complex numbers {λj} ?J = 1. We introduce the value σ (λ ′) = lim j → ger ln j | λj | . Let λ now denotes the sequence {λk, mk}, where λk is complex numbers, such as | λk | → +urb with k → ∞, and MK - natural numbers. Through σ (λ) we will denote a vehicle σ (λ ′), where λ ′ is a sequence {λ′J}, which is arbitrarily compiled from members of the sequence λk so that each point λk is found in it exactly MK once. We introduce more the size M (λ) = lim k → φ mk/| λk |. In addition, through θ (λ), we denote the many limiting points of the sequence {λk/| λk |} (excluding the point λk = 0 from it if it exists). Consider a number of exponential monomas, i.e., a number of the species, mk - 1∑ k = 1, n = 0 dk, nz n exp (λkz). (1) For the sequence of the coefficients d = {dk, n} and ă ∈ θ (λ), we put H (D, ă) = Inf limj → و 06N6MK (J) −1 ln (1/| DK (J), N |) | λk (j) | , 131 where the infinum is taken by all subsequentnesses {λk (j) the sequence {λk}, such that λk (j)/| λk (j) | converges to ă ∈ θ (λ) when j → urb. We introduce a convex area in the complex plane D = D (D, λ) = {z: re (zising) <h (d, ă), ă ∈ θ (λ)}. Theorem. Let σ (λ) = m (λ) = 0. Then a row (1) converges at each point of region D and diverges at each point of its appearance. Comment. In a particular case, having transformed W = EZ, translating a row φ∑ n = 1 dn Exp (NZ) in the steppe row, the floor is the next formula for the radius of the convergence of the latter: R = Exph (D, 1) = Limk → ° 1 K √ | DK | . This is the Koshi -Adamar formula. The work was carried out with the support of the RFFI, project 06-01-00067. The maximum Torah of the Algebra of the series R. I. Kuznetsov, O. A.
