Einstein metrics with two functional parameters consider the four-dimensional rimanov metric of the type G = DT2 +A21 (E 1) 2 +A22 (T) ((E 2) 2 +(E3) 2), where 1-form of the EI form the algebra basis SU (2). As you know, E.G. Malkovich 93 Eight Einstein Ricij = λgij is a nonlinear differential equation of the second order on the AI ​​(T) function. It is known that with a suitable choice of coordinates systems, a number of classic einstein meters (metrics of Fubini-stupid, Taub-no, Eguchi-Khanson) are appreciated by the system of equations {a′1 = K1 (A2) 2 + K2 A2 + K3, A ′ 2 = L1 (A1 A2) 2 + L2 A2 + L3. For suitable constants Ki and LJ. The considered system, the same way, can be considered as one of the ways to get the degree of Einstein's equation. It was shown that in addition to the already known Einstein metrics, there is another Ricci-flat metric that satisfies this system: ρ4 (c2-ρ2) 4 dρ2 + 1 ρ2 (E1) 2 + ρ2 (C2-ρ2) 2 ((E2) 2 (E2) 2 + (E3) 2). This metric is incomplete: at the singular moment of the time of the T0, the second function A2 (t) behaves as γ (t - t0) 1 3 + 9 5 (t - - --t0) for some constant γ, and the first a1 (t) "explodes" explodes »Like γ 2 3 (t - t0) - 1 3. With t → و the function A1 (t) strives for the constant, and the function A2 (t) becomes equivalent to linear function 2T.
