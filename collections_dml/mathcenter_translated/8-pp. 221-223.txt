Martsinkevich for the Haara system, let T = {Eint}+gerN = −M - the trigonometric system, the number α ∈ (0, 2), and the function F ∈ L (0, 2π). We put Aα = Aα (t) = {f: +ger∑ n = −mm | cn (f) α <mm}, where cn = cn (f) = 1 2π 2π∫ 0 f (t) e --intd t . In 1934, Levy proved that if f ∈ A1 (t), and the function F is analytical on f ([0, 2π]), then the function f (f) ∈ A1 (t). In this regard, Levy raised the question of what functions F can be taken in this theorem. In 1958, Katsnelson established the opposite for the Levy theorem and, thereby, only analytical functions F act from class A1 (t) to class A1 (t). In 1940, Martsinkevich began to consider many functions F ∈ Aα (t) with α ∈ (0, 1), where transformations F type J 1 α occurred. Let ω (δ) - the continuity module, and τ (n) - the positive 221 sequence with n = 0, ± 1, ± 2, .... We put ‖f‖, τ = +ger∑ n = − least ω (| cn (f) |) τ (n). We do not know here the final results about the transformations of F even for the case τ (n) ≡ 1. Here we will consider similar issues for the HAARA X = {χm (t)} ughter system, where you can get enough general results. We introduce the necessary definitions. We will determine the positive sequence τ (m) through the functions τ (t) with t ≥ 1. They say that τ (t) almost grows up (almost) if there is C1> 0 that τ (t1) ≤ c1τ ( t2) (τ (t1) ≥ c1τ (t2)) with t2> t1 ≥ 1. The almost-expanding (almost reducing) function τ (t) satisfies ∆2-condition, if there is C2> 0 that τ (2T ) ≤ c2τ (t) (τ (2t) ≥ c2τ (t)) for t ≥ 1. One of the main results is the theorem. Let ω (δ)-the continuity module, and τ (t)-an almost-expanding (or almost-absorbing) function that satisfies ∆2-condition. Then the inequality of aω, τ (f (f) ≤ cω, τ, f aω, τ (f) (1) is made for all f ∈ L (0, 1) and all f ∈ Lipm1 for some constant Cω, τ, f In the case when 1∫ αn ω (δt) t τ (2NT2) d t ≤ c3τ (2N) ω (δ), with all δ> 0 and n = 1, 2, ..., where αn = 2–N/2. Based in this theorem, certain values ​​of the function τ (t), we will receive conditions for the continuity module ω (δ), when inequality is fair (1). 222 Work was supported by the Russian Federation (project 99-01-00062) and the program “Leading Scientific Schools” (project 00-15-96143). G. M. Ustinov (Yekaterinburg) about the Quasichebyshev subspurities in c (q, x) if z is a ban on the space, l is the closed subspace in z, x ∈ Z \ L, then plx = {y ∈ L: ‖x -y‖y‖ = Inf zlex ‖x --z‖}. Let X - reflexive strictly convex space. Let's say that X has a property (*) if in x ∗ there is such a complete minimum system (fk) φk = 1, which for any n ∈ N many an = {x ∈ X: ∃ onic ∈ [(fk) nk = nk = 1], ‖ices = 1, onic (x) = ‖x‖} is certainly. Note that the space is LP, 1 <p < +φ has a property (*). Theorem 1. Let Q - counting compact, X has a property (∗). Then in C (q, x) there are such subspace l, e, that: 1) Dim l = codim l = +urb; 2) E = C (Q, X); 3) PLG is a single-point ∀ g ∈ E. Theorem 1 is of interest in connection with the following known task: does any separatic space C (Q, X) Chebyshevsky subspace l, Dim l = codim l = +inous contains? If L, E is the subspace in C (Q, X), then D (L, E) - Hausdorfova Metric between single balls of spaces E, L. Theorem 2. Let Q - counting compact, l ⊂ c (q, x), DIM L = CODIM L = +inous. Then ∀ ε> 0 there are such subspace E ⊂ c (q, x) and the counting subset a ⊂ c (q, x), a = c (q, x), which: 1) d (l, e) <ε, 2) peg 6 = Ø if g ∈ A. B. N. Khabibullin (Ufa) 223
