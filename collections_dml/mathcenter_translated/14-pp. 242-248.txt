) An unfobrugal regional task for one degenerate hyperbolic equation 1. The setting of the problem. Equation l (u) ≡ uxy - β y - xux = 0, (1) 0 <β <1, consider on the set G = g - ∪ g+, where g - = {(x, y): 0 <x <y) <h}, g+ = {(x, y): 0 <y <x <h}. Task I. Find the function u (x, y) with properties: u (x, y) ∈ C (ω); ux (x, y), uy (x, y), uxy (x, y) ∈ C (ω) for ω = g, (2) l (u) ≡ 0 on the set G, (3) ∫ h x u (x t) dt = ρ (x), x ∈ [0, h], (4) u (h, y) = onic (y), y ∈ [0, h], (5) ν - (x) = --Ν+(x), x ∈ (0, h), (6) where ν - (x) = lim x - y → −0 ux (y - x) −β, (7) ν+(x) = lim x -y →+0 ux (x - y) −β. (8) 2. Auxiliary task in the field of g - and lemma about the sign of the limit ν - (x). For the equation (1) in the area ω = g - we solve the edge problem with conditions (2), (4) and u (x, x) = τ (x), x ∈ [0, h]. (9) From the formula of the general solution of the equation (1) in the area G -: U (x, y) = c2 (y) + ∫ y x c1 (t) (y - t) βdt, (10) where c1 (t) ∈ C (0, H), C2 (Y) ∈ C1 (0, H) - arbitrary functions. Subordinating the function (10) to the requirement (9), and then (4), we have consistently have τ (x) = c2 (x), u (x, y) = τ (y) + ∫ y x c1 (t) (y - t ) βdt, 248 Where ρ (x) = ∫ h x τ (y) dy + 1 1 + β ∫ h x c1 (t) (h - t) 1 + βdt. Differentting this identity, we determine C1 (t) and obtain u (x, y) = τ (y) - (1 + β) ∫ y x [ρ ′ (t) + τ (t)] (h - t) −1–1- β (y - t) βdt. (11) The following theorem is proved 1. If τ (x) ∈ C1 [0, h], ρ (x) ∈ C2 [0, h] and ρ ′ (h) = 0, then the solution of equi (1), which satisfies Requirements (2) for ω = g -, (4) and (9), exists, only and is determined by the formula (11). Obviously, for function (11), the limit (7) is ν - (x) = (1 + β) [ρ ′ (x) + τ (x)] (h - x) −1 --β, (12) and 12) and We can conclude about the sign ν - (x). Lemma 1. If u (x, y) ∈ C (G -) - the solution of the equation (1) in the area of ​​G -, determined by the formula (11), and the function τ (x) reaches the segment [0, h] the greatest positive ( the smallest negative) value at point x0 ∈ (0, h), while ρ (x) ≡ 0 for all x ∈ [0, h], then ν - (x0)> 0 (ν - (x0) <0). 3. Auxiliary task in the G+ and Lemma about the sign of the limit ν+ (x). In the G+ region, we determine the type of only ([1], p. 1645) Solving the first problem of Darbu for equation (1) with data (5), (9). According to the formula of the general solution of the equation (1) in the area G + U (X, Y) = C2 (Y) + ∫ X Y C1 (T) (T - Y) βDT, where C1 (t) ∈ C (0, H), C2 (y) ∈ C1 (0, h), satisfying the boundary conditions (9) and (5), find u (x, y) = τ (y) + ∫ x y c1 (t - y) βdt, С (t - y) (t - y) ( y) = τ (y) + ∫ h y c1 (t - y) βdt or ∫ h y c1 (t) (t - y) β -11dt = 1 β [τ ′ (y) - ship (y) ]. Turning this integral equation of Abel (see, for example, [2], p. 30), provided that τ ′ (h) = ship (h), we get C1 (t) and u (x, y) = τ (y) - 1 βb (β, 1- β) i1 (x, y), (13) 249 where i1 (x, y) = ∫ x y (t - y) βdt ∫ h t [τ ′ ′ (s) - ship ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ (s)] (s - t) −βds. Transformations using the integral representation of the function f (a, b; c; z) are given ([3], p. 72) i1 (x, y) = b (1– β, 1 + β) ∫ x y [τ ′ ′ ( s) - ∗ ′ ′ (s)] (s) ds + + (x - y) 1 + β 1 + β ∫ h x [τ ′ ′ (s) - gment ′ ′ (s)] (s - y) - −βf (β, 1 + β; 2 + β; x - y s - y) ds. So, the identity (13) is equivalent to the following: u (x, y) = [∗ ′ (x) - τ ′ (x)] (x - y) + τ (x) + onic (y) - ship (x) - - - (x - y) 1 + β (β) 2b (β, β) ∫ h x [τ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ (t)] (t - y) −βf (β, 1 + β ; 2 + β; x - y t - y) dt. (14) We formulate the result in the form of a theorem. Theorem 2. If τ (x), onic (y) ∈ C2 [0, h] and τ ′ (h) = ship (h), then the solution of the problem is darbu for the equation (1) in the area G+ with data (5) , (9) is determined by the formula (14). Applying the formula of reduced differentiation ([3], p. 72) d dz [zc -1f (a, b; c; z)] = (c - 1) xc --2f (a, b; c - 1; z), We write down the limit (8) for function (14): ν+(x) = - 1 βb (β, 1– β) ∫ h x [τ ′ ′ (t) - ising ′ ′ (t)] (t - x) - - βdt. (15) If the conditions of theorem 2 are fulfilled, then believing here x = x0, x0 ∈ (0, h) and onic (y) ≡ 0 for all y ∈ [0, h], we find ν+(x0) integration in parts) = 1 b (β, 1- β) τ (x0) (h - x0) −1 --β + + 1 + β b (β, β) ∫ h x0 [τ (x0) - τ (t)]] (t - x0) β -2DT. (16) Note that this idea is justified by applying τ (x) ∈ C2 [0, h] formulas of Taylor ([4], p. 146). From equality (16) we directly conclude that 250 lemma 2. If u (x, y) ∈ C (G+) - the solution of equation (1) in the G+region, determined by the formula (14), and the function τ (x) reaches on the segment [0, h] the greatest positive (smallest negative) value at point x0 ∈ (0, h), while onic (y) ≡ 0 for all y ∈ [0, h], then ν - (x0)> 0 ( ν - (x0) <0). 3. The theorem of the uniqueness of the solution of the problem I theorem 3. If the conditions of theorem 1, 2 are fulfilled and there is a solution to the problem I, then it is the only one. Proof. Suppose the existence of two different solutions U1 (x, y), u2 (x, y) Tasks I. Consider the function u (x, y) = u1 (x, y) - u2 (x, y), (17) which satisfies set of G to equation (1) and zero regional conditions (4), (5). Let the function u (x, x) = τ (x) are different for x ∈ [0, h] from identical zero. Without limiting the community of reasoning, we consider τ (0) = τ (h) = 0. Then the function τ (x) as continuous on the segment [0, h] has a Weerstrass theorem at point x0 ∈ (0, h) a positive or negative minimum . Applying lemma 1, 2, we come to
