. The reverse task of assimilating the data of the method of the lying drops of E.V. Volkov RNC “Kurchatov Institute”, Moscow Introduction The Method of the Lying Drop is one of the main and most reliable static methods for measuring the surface tension of high -temperature melts [1, 2]. In this method, a drop is placed on a solid horizontal unmarked or poorly wetted substrate. To calculate surface tension, a drop is photographed and its characteristic dimensions are measured in the picture. It is assumed that the surface of the drop has a symmetry of rotation. The results of the experiment of the lying drops were historically processed manually, based on the use of Bashfort and Adams tables and geometric constructions. However, this method requires an individual approach to each individual picture, time costs and, although it is quite accurate, still leaves opportunities for a more accurate solution. In this regard, at present, special attention is paid to the use of modern personal computers for processing experimental data. There are a number of computer programs for processing data obtained by the method of lying a drop (for example, [3]). At the same time, existing programs are inaccessible or expensive, and the question of their reliability remains open. In this paper, a description of the developed computer processing of the data of the lying drop method is given and the results of the computational experiment are given to determine the reliability of the restoration of the capillary permanent. 102 E.V. Volkova 1 Mathematical model The main equation of the method of the lying drop - the equation of Jung - Laplace, describing the surface of a drop with a symmetry of rotation in the form of a dependence of y (x) a drop of drops on height X above the substrate, has the form - y ′ ′ (1 + y′2) 3/2 + 1 y (1 + y′2) 1/2 = h - x α2 + 2 r0, (1.1) where h is the height of the drop above the substrate, R0 is the radius of the curvature of the drops at the upper point, α2 = σ/[(ρ1 - ρ2) g] - capillary constant, σ - surface tension, ρ1, ρ2 - density of media (inside and outside the drop), G - acceleration of free fall. To find the solution of the equation (1.1), natural parameterization of the curve y (x): (x (t), y (t)) is introduced, where t is the length of the curve from the top of the drop. Such parameterization leads to the system of equations [3]   ẍ ẍ = — – – — x α2 + ẋ y + 2 r0], ÿ = ẋ [h - x α2 + ẋ y + 2 r0] (1.2) with the initial conditions x (0) = h, y (0) = 0, ẋ = 0, ẏ = 1 and an additional condition ẋ/y | t = 0 = −1/r0. To find surface tension, it is necessary to solve the reverse task of restoring the coefficients R0, H and α 2 for the set of observation values ​​(XI, Yi), I = 1, N. The values ​​of the density parameters and the acceleration of free fall are considered known. In addition, it is believed that the height of the drop H is known from observation data. Thus, the reverse problem is solved relative to two parameters - R0 and α 2, which change within some intervals of permissible values ​​[R0 min, R0 max] and [α 2 min, α 2 max], respectively. 2 Solution to solve a direct problem (1.2) used the Runge -Kutta method of the fourth order of accuracy [4]. An example of a solution 103 The reverse task of assimilating the data of the laying drop of a direct task is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1: Solving the direct problem of the method of lying drops. The reverse problem of restoring the coefficients of the system of equations (1.2) is incorrect, to solve it, the variational method of regolarization of Tikhonov [5] with the smoothing functionality of the type J (α2, r0) = n∑ i = 1 (yi - yi - modi) 2 + a (r02 + (α2) 2) → min α2, r0, (2.1) α2 ∈ [α2MIN, α2MAX], r0 ∈ [R0 min, r0 max], where yi is the value of the observed radius, modi is the corresponding The same height XI Modeling Radius of the drop, a> 0 is a regulatory parameter, the choice of which will be discussed below. For several calculated examples, the smoothing functionality (2.1) turned out to be not unymodal. Therefore, the genetic algorithm [6] with the following launch parameters was used to minimize it: sampling 4095 points, the number of individuals in population 20, the number of iterations 6,100, the number of solutions of the direct problem> 4000, the time of work on the Pentium IV 2.53 GHZ ∼ 3 min . 104 E.V. Volkova 3 Computing experiment to verify the reliability of the restoration of capillary constant at different levels of error in the observation data, a computational experiment was conducted. To assign the observation data, the solution of the direct problem with the parameters h = 0.253, r0 = 0.27, α 2 = 0.034934, n = 40. A random disturbance was included, the total value of which was Δ2 = n∑ i = 1 ρ2 (XI, X̃i ), where ρ2 (XI, X̃i) is the distance between the unperturbed and corresponding indignant points. After finding the minimum of the function (2.1), the relative error ∆ref = | α2mod - α2 |/α2 was evaluated, as well as the solution of the solution - the norm of the difference between the observation data and the solution of the direct problem with the found value of the α2MOD parameter. Some results of the computational experiment are given in table. 1. p
