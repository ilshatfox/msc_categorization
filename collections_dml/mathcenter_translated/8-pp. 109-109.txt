Arbitrary functions systems as you know [1], polynomial incisions according to T -systems are determined by the number of alterninance points with a fixed pair of continuous on the segment [a, b] functions g, g: g (x) <g (x), x ∈ [a, b]. The task of terribly is closely related to the task of polynoma with extreme coefficients [2]. The work considers a situation where the initial system of basic functions is not necessarily a T -system. Let ln = {an a posn + · · · + a1φn + ai ∈ R}, ln (g, g) = {p ∈ ln: g ≤ p ≤ g}. The next two theorems are fair. Theorem 1. Let φ0, φ1. . . , φn -1 is a linearly independent system of continuous functions. In order for any pair g, g in condition ln (g, g) 6 = ∅ and any function φn in ln (g, g) there was the only Polin with the largest (smallest) coefficient at φn, it is necessary and enough for the φ0 system , φ1 ,. . . , φn -1 was a T -system. Theorem 2. Let l0n (g, g) 6 = ∅. If φ0, φ1 ,. . . , φn -1 is a T -system, then the pair G, G gives rise exactly two terrible according to the system φ0, φ1 ,. . . , φn. If L0N (G, G) = ∅, but LN (G, G) 6 = ∅, then the couple G, G, GOTS either one, or infinitely many heels according to the same system. L and T R A T R A 1. Dzyadik V.K.
