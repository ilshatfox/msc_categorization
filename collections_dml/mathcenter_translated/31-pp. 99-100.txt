Continuous display on fractal sets of E. N. Makhrov Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N. I. Lobachevsky, Elena_makhrova@inbox.ru in this note examines dendrites with a fractal structure. Dandrite is understood as a local coherent continuum, not containing subset, homeomorphic circles. In [1] the theorem of the existence of a motionless point in the continuous display of dendritus in itself was proven. In [2] it was shown that the fact of the existence of a motionless point in continuous display f on the segment I, provided I ⊂ F (I) (see, for example, [3]), is not generalized in case of arbitrary continuous displays of dendrites. Theorem. Let F: X → X continuous display of dendritus X in itself, and there is a final tree y ⊂ x such that y ⊂ f (y). Then y ∩ per (f) 6 = ∅. The approval of the theorem is not fair if Y is a dendritus with a counting set of branches of branching. Consider the following example. Let the dendrite X and display f: x → X are defined in the theorem with [4]. We denote through O o point with the coordinates (1 2; √ 3 2), a - a point with coordinates (1 2; 1), AI1 ... in - the point of intersection of arcs γi1 ... in, γi1 ... in0, γi1 ... in1, where I1 ,. . . , in ∈ {0, 1}. Determine the dendritis z = x ∪ [o, a] (here [o, a] - a segment connecting the points O and A) and display G: z → z, putting: 1) g ([o, a]) = {a }; 2) g | γi1: γi1 → [o, a] - linear homeomorphism such that G (AI1) = O, G (O) = A for I1 ∈ {0, 1}; 3) g | γi1 ... in: γi1 ... in γ γi1 ... in -1 - linear homeomorphism 99 such that g (ai1 ... in) = ai1 ... in -1 for any i1, . . . , in ∈ {0, 1}, n ≥ 2; 4) g (z) = z, if z ∈ E (x), where e (x) is a lot of end points of dendritis X. It is easy to check that g (z) is a continuous display of dendritis Z, many periodic points which consists only of motionless points, and per (g) = e (x) ∪ {a}. We will predict the display f (z) to the segment [o, a], believing it equal to the identical. For many per (f) periodic points F, the equality of per (f) = z \ e (x) is true. We put f = g ° f: z → z. Then 1) many periodic points of display F consists of a single fixed point a; 2) x ⊂ f (x), but x ∩ per (f) = ∅. The work was supported by the RFFF, project 04–01–00457. L and T R and T R A 1.
