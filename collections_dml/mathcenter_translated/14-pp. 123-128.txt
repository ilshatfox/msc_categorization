) The regional task of Riemann for p-analytical function on an indestructible spiral circuit 1. This work continues the [2] study of the regional task of Riemann for the p-analytical function on the spiral circuit. Formulation of the problem. Find p-analytical function F (z, z̄), the boundary values ​​of which on the curve l satisfy the condition of the Riemann f + (t) = g (t) f-(t) + g (t), t ∈ L, (1) where p where P -analytic function f (z, z̄) = u (x, y) + IV (x, y) is such that ∂u ∂x = 1 p ∂v ∂v, ∂u ∂y = −1 p ∂v ∂x , p = const, Im p ​​= 0. Research. Each p-analytic function f (z, z̄) mutually unambiguously corresponds to the analytical function onic (z), and f (z, z̄) = [(p + 1) onic (z)-(p-1) gment (z)] /(2P), (2) onic (z) = [(p + 1) f (z, z̄) + (p - 1) f (z, z̄)]/2. By substituting the value (2) B (1), we get (p + 1) onic (t) - (p - 1) onic (t) = = g (t) (p + 1) ng - (t) −g (t) (p - 1) ng - (t) + 2pg (t). (3) Simultaneously with condition (3), the conjugated condition [(p + 1) ∗ + (t) - (p - 1) onic (t)] = g (p + 1) ng - ( t) −g (t) (p - 1) ng - (t) + 2pg (t). (4) Multiply equality (3) by p + 1, equality (4) - by p - 1, we add the obtained ratios. In the case of g (t) = g (t) on l (i.e., when g (t) is a real function), we will come to the condition onic + (t) = g (t) ng - (t) + g1 (t ), (5) 129 where G1 (t) = [(p + 1) g (t) + (p - 1) g (t)]/2. Thus, the task (1) for P-Analytic function F (Z, Z̄) is reduced to the regional task of Riemann (5) for the analytical function ∗ (Z). In [1], [2], the task (1) was examined in detail on the hidden spiral -shaped circuit L. In this work, the task (1) is considered that L is the spiral contour of the endless length. The regional task of Riemann (5) in the class of limited layerly analytical functions on such a circuit was investigated in [3] - [5]. 2. Consider first the task (1) in the case of G (t) ≡ 0. This is the uniform task of Riman F+(t) = G (t) f-(t), t ∈ L, (6) for p-analytical function F ( z, z̄). In G (t) = g (t), it comes down to the homogeneous problem of the Riemann ng+(t) = g (t) ng - (t), t ∈ L, (7) for the analytical function ∗ (z). We examine this task in detail using the results previously obtained in [3] - [5]. Let the curve L = {t: t: t = t (s) = r (s) exp [iθ (s)], s ∈ [0, +φ)}, (8) where s is arc abscissa; r (s), θ (s) - continuously differentiated material functions, r (s)> 0, s ∈ [0, +∞), lims → ger r (s) = 0, lims → ger θ (s) = += + ∞. This spiral l belongs to the class S (M, µ), where M is the natural number, µ ∈ (0, 1] if و imes 0 rm/µ (s) | r ′ (s) | 1–1/µds <µds <µds (9) For a fixed point z ∈ C \ L, we denote the point L closest to Z (if there are several such points, then we take any of them). The spiral l belongs to the class S0 (m, µ) ⊂ S (m, µ ), if it has a property | ∼ | z | (10) through θz, we denote the arg tz, where the branch of the argument is highlighted using a cut according to L. enter class t (n, λ) (n - natural number, λ ∈ ( 0, 1]) the material functions ψ (t), the times differentiated according to Taylor at point 0, i.e. (t) (t) + t nψ0 (t), (11) where pψ ( t) - Polin degree not higher than n, ψ0 (t) satisfies the Helder condition with an indicator λ (ψ0 (t) ∈ Hλ), ψ0 (0) = 0. These conditions uniquely determine the functions ψ0 and pψ in decomposition (11) (see [6], C. 86). 130 Let in the problem (1) l ∈ S (M, µ), and the coefficient of the task G (t) is a real function and has the form G (t) = G (t) = Exp ψ (t), ψ (t) ∈ T (m, λ), and either λ> µ, or λ = µ = 1. Suppose that there is the final limit ν̄ (ψ) = limz → 0 [θzpψ (z)/ ln | z | −1]. Let the number κ equal to –ν̄ (ψ) - 1, if it is the whole and the function θzpψ (z) + ν̄ (ψ) ln | z | not limited from above with a small | z |; And equal [--ν̄ (ψ)] (i.e., an entire part of the number --ν̄ (ψ)) in other cases. The theorem 1 ([3], p. 83). Let in the problem (7) spiral l ∈ S0 (M, µ), the function g (t) = g (t) = exp ψ (t), ψ (t) ∈ T (m, λ), 0 <µ <λ <1, and there is the final limit of ν̄ (ψ), and the index κ> 0. Then the homogeneous task of Riemann (7) has κ + 1 linearly independent limited solutions and the general view of its solution is ∗ (z) = z - κ (z) Pκ (z), x (z) = expp 1 2πi ∫ l ψ (t) dt t - z, (12) pκ (z) - Polin degree not higher κ. If the limit ν̄ (ψ) is final and κ <0, then a homogeneous task (7) does not have non -trivial solutions. Note that the integral type of Koshi in (12) for the locally indestructible circuit L is understood in the sense of the inexplicable integral of Riemann. By substituting the found value onic (z) in (2), we get a solution to the problem (1), provided G (t) ≡ 0. Consequence 1. Let the problem (1) l ∈ S0 (m, µ), g (t) = G (t) = expp ψ (t), ψ (t) ∈ T (m, λ), 0 <µ <λ <1, g (t) ≡ 0. Let the final limit ν̄ (ψ), and index κ > 0. Then the general solution of the problem (1) in the class p-analytical functions has the form F (z, z̄) = [(p + 1) z-κ (z) pκ (z)-(p-1) z-def (z) pκ (z)]/(2p). The condition of the limb ν̄ (ψ) can be replaced with two conditions with the curve L, in general equivalent limitations ν̄ (ψ): − least <limz → 0 [θz/ ln | z | −1], limz → 0 [θz/ ln | z | −1] < +inous. We introduce another limit ν0 (ψ) = lims → φ min | z | = r (s) [θzpψ (z)/ ln | z | −1]. The investigation 2. Fair approval a) if ν0 (ψ) = +φ, then the task (6) does not have non -trivial solutions; 131 b) if | ν0 (ψ) | < +Urb, ν̄ (ψ) = +inous,
