Smirnov3 1 dvgmail@mail.ru; Tula State University 2 Ivaleryi@mail.ru; Tula State University 3 So.2@mail.ru; Tula State University studies the extreme tasks of Turan, Feier, Delsart, Logan and Boman to convert Fourier into hyperboloid -1 or in the space of Lobachevsky. Using the method of averaging in the sphere, these tasks are reduced to similar tasks for transforming Jacobi into a half -rejection. To solve them, the quadructure formulas of Gauss and Markov are used on a half -rejection for entire functions of the exponential type according to the zero functions of Jacobi. Keywords: hyperboloid, Lobachevsky’s space, Fourier transformation, extreme tasks of Turan, Feier, Delsart, Logan, Boman, quadructure formulas of Gauss and Markov for entire functions of the exponential type. The main facts of harmonic analysis on hyperboloid or in the space of Lobachevsky can be found in [1, ch. nine].
