) The theorems of the coating and distortion for algebraic polynomas methods of the geometric theory of the functions of the complex alternating are applied to inequalities for algebraic polynomas. Developing the ideas of work [1], we prove new inequalities, including, generally, a free member, senior coefficient and extreme values ​​of either a module or a real part of a polynome on a circle or on a segment. As an example, we give the following result. Theorem. Let p (z) - Polin degree N with material coefficients, normalized by conditions: max {p (z): z ∈ [−1, 1]} = −Min {p (z): z ∈ [−1, 1]}}}}}}} = 1. Then for any ρ> 2, the inclusion p ({z: | z - 1 | z + 1 | <}) ⊂ tn ({z: z - 1 | + | z + 1 | <ρ }), where is TN (Z) = 2N -1ZN+ ... - Polina Chebyshev. As the consequences from here, well -known inequalities of Chebyshev, Markov and Bernstein stem from here. The strengthening of some modern results for algebraic polynomas was also obtained [2].
