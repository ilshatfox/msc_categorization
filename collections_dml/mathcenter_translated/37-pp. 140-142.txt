Modeling in the task of multiple of the best choice with the minimum expected total rank is considered a generalization of the task of multiple of the best choice [1]. In random order, n objects ordered in quality are consistently. It is required to find the optimal strategy that will minimize the mathematical expectation of absolute ranks E (Aτ1 + Aτ2 +.. + Aτk), k> 2. Let (A1, A2, AN) - any rearrangement of numbers (1, 2, ., N). If the AI ​​is the quality of the quality object among (A1, A2,., AI), then we will write down yi = b for all I = 1, 2 ,. . . , N, yi - a relative rank of an object. We determine the price of the game v = infτ e (aτ1 + · · + aτk), τ = (τ1,., Τk). The task of the best choice with the minimum total rank is to find the optimal strategy τ ∗ = (τ ∗ 1,., Τ ∗ k) and winning values ​​v. Let F (m) I-σ-algebra, generated by the observations of relative ranks (Y1, Y2,., YMI). If z (m) k = e (am1 + · · + amk | f (m) k), 141 then v = infτ ezτ, τ = (τ1,.., Τk). Then the task comes down to the standard task of repeatedly stop the sequence Z (M) K. The solution to this problem will be the following optimal strategy: there are sets of integers, such that δ (k) = (Δ (k) 1,., Δ (k) n - k+1), 0 6 Δ (K) sixteen . . . 6 δ (k) n - k <δ (k) n --k+1 = n, ... Δ (2) = (δ (2) k - 1,., Δ (2) n - 1) , 0 6 Δ (2) K -1 6. . . 6 δ (2) n - 2 <δ (2) n - 1 = n, δ (1) = (δ (1) k,., Δ (1) n), 0 6 Δ (1) K 6 . . . 6 δ (1) n - 1 <δ (1) n = n, (1) Δ (i1) J 6 δ (i2) J, 1 6 I1 <i2 6 k, k - i1 + 1 6 j 6 n - I2 + 1, and τ ∗ 1 = min {m1: ym1 6 Δ (k) m1}, τ ∗ i = min {mi> mi - 1: ymi 6 Δ (k --i + 1) mi}, on the set Fi −1 = {ω: τ ∗ 1 = m1 ,. . . , τ ∗ i -1 = mi - 1}, i = 2 ,. . . , k, f0 = ω (see [1]). Following [2], to determine the sets δ (1) ,. . . , Δ (k) Consider the following maximization task. It is required to find maxx edx eŝ (x, r), where x = {x = (x (1),.., X (k)): Conditions (1) are fulfilled}, R = (R1,... Rn) - random rearrangement of numbers 1, 2 ,. . . , N, ŝ (x) - non -effective assessment ŝ (x, r), ŝ (x) = 1 n1 n1∑ n = 1 (rnτ1 + · · + rnτk). 142 To solve the problem of combinatorial optimization, the method of consistent minimization of the distance of Kulbak-label (Cross-Entropy Method) is used [3]. In this work, the values ​​of the game V and sets of stopping sets were obtained. L and T R A T R A 1. Nikolaevm.L. Optimal rules of multiple stop // Cross.
