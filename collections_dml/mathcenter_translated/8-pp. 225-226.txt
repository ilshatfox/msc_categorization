) The direct method of solving one class of the singular integral equations considers the unambiguously permitted integral equation X (S) + λ 2π∫ 0 H (s, σ) ctg σ - s0 2 x (σ) dσ = y (s), −mm <s <s <s <s <s <s <s <s <∞, (1) with a fixed singularity s0 ∈ R, where h (s, σ) and y (s) - known continuous 2π -periodic functions, x (t) - the desired function, and λ is an arbitrary numerical parameter. The approximate solution of equation (1) is searched in the form of xn (s) = y (s) - λ n∑ k = 1 ckak (s), n ∈ N, (2) where C1, C2 ,. . .

In the work based on the results [1, 2] and the properties of the rowing formula (5), the following results were obtained: 1) various sufficient conditions for unambiguous resolution of both the exact equation (1) and its stalls approving (3) - (4) - (4); 2) the convergence of approximate solutions (2) to the solution x ∗ (s) equations (1) is proved and the speed of convergence is determined; 3) Effective evaluations of the errors of the approximate formula x ∗ (s) ≈ xn (s), n ∈ N, −mber <s <mm, taking into account the structural properties of the initial data are established.
