The solution to the reverse problem of three-dimensional filtration in a deformable fissitive-pore environment in this paper based on regulatory methods solves the problem of evaluating the filtration parameters of a crack-pouring layer based on the results of hydrodynamic studies of horizontal wells, taking into account the dependence of the permeability of crack cracks. The process of three-dimensional filtration to a horizontal well in a fissitive-porist layer is described by a system of non-linear differential equations: β ∗P1 ∂t = ∇ [k (p1) µ ∇p1] + α µ (p2-p1), (1) β ∗ 2 ∂p2 ∂t = −α µ (p2 - p1), (x, y, z) ∈ V, 0 <t <t, with initial and boundary conditions: p1 (x, y, z, t0) = p2 (x , y, z, t0) = f (x, y, z), 5 p1 ∣∣ ∂v1 = p2 ∣∣ ∂v1 = pk, (w, n) ∣∣ ∂v2 = 0, (2) p1 ∣∣ SC = const, ∫ SC (w, n) dσ = Q (t), where Pi, βi (i = 1, 2) - pressure and coefficient of elastic intensity of cracks and blocks, respectively; PK - pressure on the circuit; f (x, y, z) - the initial distribution of pressure in the layer; k = k (p1) - coefficient of permeability of cracks; µ - fluid viscosity; α is the parameter of the renewal characterizing the exchange of fluid between blocks and cracks; V is the filtration area; ∂V1 - lateral surface of the layer; ∂V2 - roof and sole of the layer; RC - well radius; SC - the surface of the well; Q (t) = Q0 +C∂P1/∂T; C is the coefficient of the effect of the barrel of the well; w = −k (p1) µ ∇p1 - the rate of fluid filtering in cracks; N is a single vector of normal. The layer, which is a double filtration area, is covered with a limited grid, thickening to the horizontal well trunk. The solution of the reverse problem is searched for at least the functionality of the miserable: j (k) = t∫ 0 (pH (t) - pb (t)) 2 dt, k ∈ D, (3) where T is the time of the experiment; pH (t) - observed values ​​of sore pressure; PB (t) - solving a direct problem (1) - (2). The coefficient k = k (p) of permeability of cracks is searched in the class of exponential functions of the type K (p) = k0exp (λ (p0 - p)). Here K0, λ is unknown parameters, P0 = PK - initial pressure. Laboratory studies have shown that such functions are well approximated by the dependence of permeability on pressure [1]. 6 The reverse problem is solved by the method of iteration regulatory [2, 3]. The gradients of the functionality (3) necessary for the minimization procedure are calculated from the solution of a direct and appropriate associated problem. L and Tr. T R A 1.
