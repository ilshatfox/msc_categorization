On Construction of the Koch Curve and the Koch Snowflake in the Beltrami - Klein Model of the Lobachevski Plane D.S. Lisenkov, P.I.

Keywords: Non-euclidean Geometry, Lobachevskii Geometry, Fraactal, L-System UDC 510.5 SN l relationships on computable linear order and their relationship Ya.A. Mikhailovskaya1 1 yana.michailovskaya@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University This work is devoted to the study of the relationship between SN L on a computable linear order l. In the work, examples of computable linear orders are built, on which the relations of SN L and SN+1 L have different yurring degrees, and the isolation of all of the computable SN L on the computable linear orders that are not η sizes were studied in the classroom. Keywords: computable linear order, turing degree, subordinatedly listed in this work, calculated linear orders are considered, in the signature of which some additional relationships are added. These relationships are designated as SN L and set as follows: S2K L (X, Y) � (X <L Y) & (| (X, Y) L | = 0 ∨ | (X, Y) L | = 2∨. . ∨ | (x, y) l | = 2k), s2k+1 l (x, y) � (x <l y) & (| (x, y) l | = 1 ∨ | (x, y) L | = 3∨.. ∨ | (x, y) l | = 2k +1), here (x, y) l = {z | X <l z <l y}. In the course of studying SN L, the question arose of computable linear orders about their relationship. The following sentences shed light on this question: sentence 1. For any N> 0, the calculated linear order L is in such a thing that the ratio of SN L is computable, but the ratio of SN+1 L is not computable. Drying 2. For any N, the calculated linear order l is existed that the ratio of SN+1 L is computable, but the attitude of SN L is not calculated. L.I. Moroz, A.G. Maslovskaya 121 Spectrum ratio PL of the calculated linear order L is called the class DG SPL (p) = {degt (PR) | (∃r ∼ = l) r ≡t;}. Summarizing the result of A.N. Frolova [1] In case of SN L, the following theorem was proved: theorem 1. If the calculated linear order l is not η sensitive, then the spectrum of the relationship of SN L is closed up in V.P. Stepheni. The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (project 18-31-00174-algorithmic aspects of linear orders and relations on them). Literature 1. Frolov, A.N.

The Relations Sn L O Computable Linear Orders and Their Correlats Ya.A. Michailovskaya this Paper is devote to the study of corrections of the Relations SN L N N NU A Computable Linear Orderl. In this paper, we constructed some examples of computable linear orders, on which the relations Sn L  and Sn+1 L  have different Turing degrees, and also a closing upwards of the relation Sn L on non-η-like  computable linear orders in the Class of All Computably Enumerable Degrees Was Studved.

Moroz1, A.G. Maslovskaya2 1 svpn.1402@gmail.com; Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education "Amur State University 2 Maslovskyaag@mail.ru; The Federal State Budgetary Educational Institution of Higher Education “Amur State University in the work proposes a fractal mathematical model of hysteresis phenomena in segnertoelectric materials using the concepts of fractional differentiation. The mathematical model is formalized as an initial-border task for the equation of abnormal diffusion. Based on the approximation of the fractional derivative according to the Grunwald -Sumynikov formula, an implicit variable scheme for solving the task was designed. A software solution has been developed for computer modeling. The results of a computational experiment are presented. Keywords: an equation of abnormal diffusion, the Landau - Halatnikov equation, Grunwald - Sumynikova formula, implicit scheme, a model of switching polarization of segotheelectric, segnelectric hysteresis
