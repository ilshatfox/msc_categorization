. The use of curved orthogonal coordinates to calculate the currents of Nysonyutonic liquids in the cylindrical channels of V.I. Malov Institute of Mechanics and Engineering of the KNC RAS, Kazan V.F. Sharafutdinov Kazan State University, Kazan in the article proposes an approximate method for calculating the hundred civil currents of the Nentonon fluids in the cylindrical channels of arbitrary cross -section under the action of the pressure difference. It is known [1] that many liquid systems of solutions, in particular, polymers melts belong to the class of Nysenyutonic fluids. The course of solutions and melts of polymers through the channels of a complex configuration are an integral part of processes such as the formation of fibers and casting under pressure. 211 use of curved orthogonal coordinates. . . These processes use mouthpieces, the cross section of which is not circular. The ability of the material to form fiber will be determined by the rheological properties of the liquid, as well as the size and shape of the filter channels. The stationary tasks of the course of Nenyutonovsky liquids in cylindrical channels with a complex cross section are solved, as a rule, using numerical methods [2, 3]. The use of numerical methods for solving the problem of the course of viscoplastic fluid (model of Swedov - - Tagdam) causes certain difficulties, since the unknown boundary of the plastic core is formed in the course of the course, and it is only known that inside this nucleus the tensor of deformation velocities are turned into zero. This article proposes a numerically analytical approximate method, the peculiarity of which is the introduction of a curved orthogonal coordinate system associated with the border of the course of the course, which allows you to formulate the determining equations and boundary conditions in stresses. Consider the inpatient course of the Nonnyutonovsky fluid in the cylindrical pipe of the length L under the action of the pressure difference ∆P. Equations of movement in stresses and rheological ratios in the curve orthogonal system of the coordin q1, q2, q3 (coordinate Q1 is directed along the stream) are [4] ∂ (h3τ12/h2) ∂q2 + ∂ (h2τ13/h3) ∂q3 =-∂q3 =-∂q3 =-∂q3 =- h2h3, (1) τ12 = µ̄ ∂u/∂q2, τ13 = µ̄ ∂u/∂q3. (2) here dimensionless functions H2, H3, τ12, τ13, U, µ̄ are expressed through physical components as follows: τ12 = σ12H2/rison; τ13 = σ13H3/rison; H2 = H2/R; h3 = h3/r; µ̄ = µ/µ0; u = u1µ0/r 2λ, where σ12, σ13 - physical components of the voltage divator; h2, h3 - parameters of layers; λ = ∆P/l - the module of the gradient of the pressure; µ - the scalar function of the second invariant of the voltage divator i2 = √ (τ12/h2) 2 + (τ13/h3) 2; µ0 - constant coefficient of 212 V.I. Malov, V.F of Sharafutdinov Dimension µ; U1 - physical component of speed; R is the characteristic size of the channel cross section. A specific type of function µ̄ and constant µ0 determine the rheological model of the environment. If in one case, the rheological ratio between the tangent voltage and the speed of the shift has the form τ = µ (γ̇) γ̇, then in the two -dimensional case this ratio is modified. So, for the Newtonon fluid τ = µ̇, µ̄ = 1; For the degree fluid, when τ = kγ̇n, the rheological parameters are µ0 = k 1/n (rλ) (n - 1)/n, µ̄ = i (n - 1)/n 2 for the Jewish -bone of Swedov -Tagdam with a rheological law τ = τ0 + ηγ̇ is fair µ0 = η, µ̄ = i2 (i 2 2 - s) −1/2, s = τ0/(Rλ). Having excluded the speed from the rheological ratios (2), we get ∂ (τ12/µ̄)/∂q3 - ∂ (τ13/µ̄)/∂q2 = 0. (3) equation (3) together with equation (1) forms a closed system for the model for the model Nysenyutonovsky fluid. The proposed approximate method of solving the system of equations (1), (3) contains three essential points: 1. The system of orthogonal curved coordinates Q2, Q3 is built so that the boundary conditions for the desired functions τ12, τ13: τ12 = τ13 = 0 for Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = Q2 = 0 2; (4) τ13 = 0 with Q3 = Q 0 3, Q3 = Q 1 3, Q2 = Q 1 2, (5) At the same time, it is believed that Q2 ∈ [Q02, Q12], Q3 ERRA [Q03, Q13]; 2. We look for the voltage function in the form of a row τ13 = m∑ i = 1 aiai (q2) bi (q3), (6) where AI is constant, to be determined; The functions AI (Q2) and BI (Q3) are selected in such a way as to satisfy the boundary conditions (4), (5); 213 The use of curved orthogonal coordinates. . . 3. To determine AI coefficients, the ratio is used (3). We illustrate the application of the method on solving the problem of the fluid in the channel, the cross section of which is shown in Fig. 1. y x gp p/n Fig. 1: The cross -sectional diagrams of the pipe: the barpunctic Q2 = const, the continuous lines Q2 = CSTST system of the coordinate Q2, Q3 is built using conformal display.
