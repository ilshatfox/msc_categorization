Its series of Taylor in the vicinity of the point Z = 0 is recorded in the form F (Z) = A0 · ger∑ N = 0 H (N) N! , lim n → و (| h (n) | n!) 1/n ≤ e · a, where (1) h (n) = ∑ i1+·.,+in = n n! I1!

If the sequence {an} و = 0, starting from a certain number K0, is periodic, i.e. ak0+ml+j = αj; j = 1, 2 ,. . . , m; l = 0, 1 ,. . ., then the convergence is guaranteed in the open circle K radius 1/(e · α), where α = max 1≤j≤m | αj |. In [3], 48 system m systems of non-linear differential equations of the 1st order is given (see formulas (1) and (2)), which has a system from M periodic chain exhibits by its solution. In general, α = min 1≤j≤m | αj | <α, and the radius of convergence will be the pain by reducing the upper limit (1). At m = 2 (see [3] and the literature quoted there), this upper limit can be calculated for f (z) = 〈ez; α, β, α, β ,. . .〉 By information of form h (n) from the coefficients a2k = α, a2k+1 = β, k = 0, 1, 2 ,. . ., to Politnaya from two variables. With m ≥ 3, this limit is also calculated by assessing the form H (n) of the Ott coefficients α1, α2 ,. . . , αm, which is represented in the form of: h (n) (α1,., αm) = ∑ k1+·,+km = n n! K1! (2) This is a polych nth degree from m arguments. One of its main properties lies in the fact that with any natural n and m and with α1 = α2 = · · · = αm = α, equality H (n) = (n + 1) n -1 · αn is performed. L and T R A T R A 1. BARROW D. F.
