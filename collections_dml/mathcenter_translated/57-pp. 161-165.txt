Kabanko1 1 kabankom@gmail.com; Kursk State University examines the concepts of poorly regular multiple sets in the spaces of entire functions of the final order. It is proved that such sets are interpolation sets. Key words: a whole function, regular set, interpolation task. 162 Materials of the School-Conference The term regular set in a complex plane was introduced by B.Ya. Levin [1, p. 126]. It has been proved that such sets are interpolation in the space of entire functions of quite regular growth with an indicator less than the specified manner specified in this specified order. This concept was generalized in various directions. In particular, in [2], the concept of a weakly regular set in the spaces of entire functions of the non -mound final order was introduced and in spaces of entire functions of the type no higher than normal relatively unnecessary final order. In [3], the concept of a weakly regular set was extended to the space of entire functions of the type no higher than normal relatively zero finite order. In all the noted works and works that fell into the vision of the author of this article, it was assumed that regular sets have no multiple points. However, in many tasks of the theory of functions (for example, when constructing canonical works of sets, interpolation tasks), many with multiple points have to be considered. The aim of this work is to generalize the concepts of regular sets in case of points that have multiplicity other than one. We introduce the necessary definitions and designations. Let f (z) - a whole function, m (f, r) = max 0éiment <2π | f (r ei accord) | . Through [ρ, urb], we denote the space of entire functions whose order does not exceed ρ, ρ ê 0, that is, such as limsup r → ° ln+ ln+ m (f, r) lnr é ρ. Let d = {an, qn} inous = 1 - a division, i.e. Many different complex numbers {an = rneiison} و = 1 ⊂c along with their multiples {qn} mmn = 1 ⊂n. By the given division D, we determine the measure: µd (z) = ger∑ n = 1 qnδ (z --an), where δ (·) - delta dirac function. We will use the following designation: c (z, t) = {w ∈C: | w - z | É t} - A vicious circle with a center at the point Z radius t. We determine the family of functions φ̃d (z, α) = (µd (c (z, α | z |)) - qn)+, 0 <α <1/2, where QN is the multiplicity of the division closest to Z (if such points Several, then we take a point with the greatest multiplicity; if there are several of them - any of them, for example, a point with the largest imaginary part). It is not difficult to get the following statement from the cat formula for derivatives: if the function f ∈ [ρ, urb], then inequality | f (k - 1) (z) | É (k −1)! Exp [| z | ρ+ε], k ∈N, performed with a fixed ε> 0 for all quite large zs, | z | > Rε. This inequality leads to the rationality of the introduction of the following definition. Determination 1. Divizer d = {an, qn} و = 1 is called interpolation in space [ρ, urb] if for any sequence of complex numbers BN, K, MV Kabanko 163 k = 1.2 ,. . . , qn, n purpose, satisfying the condition limsup n → φ 1 ln | an | LN+ LN+ SUP 1ékéqn | BN, K | (K −1)! É ρ, there is a function F ∈ [ρ, inous] with the property: F (k - 1) (AN) = BN, K, K = 1.2 ,. . . , qn, n purpose. (I) In such a setting, the task of interpolation refers to the problems of free interpolation, when minimal restrictions related to the need to obtain a decision in a given class are imposed on the values ​​of the interprooping function in the nodes. In the work of K. G. Malyutin and O. A. Bozhenko [4], the necessary and sufficient conditions for the interpolation of the divizer D in the space [ρ, ∞] were found in terms of the canonical work of the division D and in terms of the family of functions φ̃d (z, α). In particular, it has been proved that the divin D is interpolation in the space [ρ, urb], then and only when the ratios are performed for any ε> 0: ger∑ n = 1 qn | an | ρ+ε <φ, limsup n → ° ln qn ln | an | É ρ, (1) and limsup z → φ 1 ln | z | ln + ∫ 1/2 0 φ̃d (z, α) α dαé ρ. (2) Note that the task (I) was considered by G.P. Lapin [5], who studied only the case ρ> 0 and received the criteria for resolving the problem (I) in terms of canonical works. Lapin considered the task (I) at the following restrictions on the values ​​in the interpolation nodes: limsup n → φ 1 ln | an | LN+ LN+ SUP 1ékéqn | BN, K | É ρ, that is, in such a setting, the task (I) is not the task of free interpolation. We introduce the following definition. Determination 2. Divizor d = {an, qn} و = 1 is called C
