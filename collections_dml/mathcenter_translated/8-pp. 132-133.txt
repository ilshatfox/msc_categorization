) The boundary values ​​of the integral of the Koshi on the self -like fractal curve let γ are the closed Zordanov curve on the complex plane, and F (t) - the function set on it. If the curve γ is hidden, and f ∈ L (γ), then with Z 6] the function F (z) = 1 2πi ∫ γ ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ dt t - z, (1) called the Cosa integral. In this paper, the integral (1) is studied in a situation where the γ curve is fractal and therefore unearthly. Despite this, the integral exists with certain restrictions on γ and f. Let φ (x) are continuous, monotonously increasing at x ≥ 0. The function is such that φ (0) = 0. The curve γ is called φ sprinkled if SUPζ ∑ J rune (| zj - zj - 1 | ger, where Supremum takes on all the final sequences of the points ζ = {z0, z2 ,. . . , zj,. . .} ⊂ γ, technology in the manner of bypass γ. Regarding the function f, we assume that it satisfies the condition of the Hölder with the indicator ν ∈ (0, 1]. It can be shown that the integral (1) exists as an integral of the style, provided that the row is ∑ motor n = 1 onic 1+ν (1/n ), where onic is a function inverse to φ. Further, the closed curve γ is called self -like if for each point t γ can indicate its arc 132 ⊂ γ, the image of which is transformed by the likeness Z 7 → T+K (z - z - z - z - z - z - z - z - t), 0 <| k | <1, is also an arc on the curve γ. Theorem. Let the self-like curve γ is φ-sprayed, and the function of the function f satisfies on it satisfies the condition of the Hölder with indicator ν. If the function is φ (x) convex and Its reverse function onic (x) satisfies the inequality ∗1+µ (x) <cx for some µ ∈ (0, ν), C> 0 and all fairly small X, then the integral of the Cossack (1) has continuous boundary values ​​at each point t ∈ γ when approaching it from both sides. This theorem shows to what extent the self -mileage of the curve allows you to weaken the conditions of the border the values ​​of the integral (1) obtained for the entire class of φ-sprayed curves in [1].

Kokurin (Yoshkar -Ola) Ittative methods of the gradient type for finding quasi of irregular non -linear operator equations are considered the equation f (x) = 0, where f: h1 → h2 - non -linear twice differentiated by the GATO, H1, H2 - Hilbert space. In cases where the resolution of the original equation is not guaranteed, the task of finding its quasi -playing is set, i.e., points X ∗, which delivers a minimum to H1, the functionality of the miserable ffic (x) = 12‖f (x) ‖2. We believe that instead of the exact operator f (x), only its approximation f̃: h1 → h2, which has in the vicinity ωr points x ∗ about 133
