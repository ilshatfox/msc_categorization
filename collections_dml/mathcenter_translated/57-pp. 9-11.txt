The substantiation of Galerkin’s solution to the solutions of one class of integro -radio equations of Yu.R. Agachev1, M.Yu. Pershagin2 1 juriy.agachev@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 mpershagin@mail.ru; The Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the article is justified by the polynomial method of gallerykin to solve regional problems for ordinary integro -radio equations, when the order of the internal differential operator above the corresponding external. The method of convergence of the method is characterized in terms of the best polynomial approximations of the exact solution, which automatically responds to the smooth -ocal properties of the coefficients of the equation. Key words: Sobolev’s space, Jacobi -Gagenbauer weight, integro - differential equation, Koshi task, polynomial approach, Galerkin method, method of method. Let m + 1, p ∈ N, p> m. It is considered, for certainty, the unambiguous task of koshi1 x (i) ( - 1) = 0, i = 1, m, (1) for the integro -radio equation k x ≡ x (m) (t)+ m∑ k = 1 gk (t) x (m --k) (t) + p∑ j = 0 + 1∫ −1 h j (t, s) x (j) (s) d s = y (t), −1 ≤ t ≤ 1 , (2) where y (t), gk (t), k = 1, m, and h j (t, s), j = 0, p are known functions in their areas of definition. Let ρ (t) = p 1 - t 2 - the weight of Chebyshev of the second kind, ql (t) = {ρ (t)} 2l - 1, l +1 ∈N, - the weight of Jacobi -gegenbauer. We denote through L2, QL ≡ L2, QL (−1,1) the space of the functions of the functions, quadratically shed with weight QL (t) in the interval (−1.1), w r l2, qr ≡ w r l2, qr [ - - - 1.1], r ∈ N, - the space of the Sobolev functions f (t) ∈ L2, ρ that have derivatives f (l) (t) ∈ L2, QL, 1 ≤ L ≤ R. The norm in the space w r l2, qr is set according to the formula ∥ f ∥r; 2, qr =   +1∫ −1 r∑ l = 0 ql (t) | F (l) (t) | 2D T 1/2. We also introduce L1 spaces of functions in the interval (−1.1) and W SL2, QR ≡ W SL2, QR [−1,1], S> R, continuous functions F (t), for which there is a derivative f (S- r) (t) ∈W R l2, qr. In the space W SL2, QR, we set the midnight according to the formula ∥ f ∥s; 2, qr = ∥ f (s --r) ∥r; 2, qr. (3) The task (1), (2) we will consider (with proper requirements relative to the coefficients of the equation) in a pair of spaces (x, y), where y = w r l2, qr, r = p - 1 at m = 0 initial initial There are no conditions. 10 Materials of the School-Conference M ≥ 1, X = ° W P L2, QR-a subspace of functions from W P L2, QR, satisfying on cuper conditions (1). In the space of the X midnight (3) it is a norm according to which, obviously, X becomes complete. In a pair of spaces (x, y), the initial (unambiguously permitted) task can be recorded in the operator: k x ≡ dx +gx +h x = y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y), (4) where dx ≡ x (4) (4) m) (t), gx ≡ (gx) (t) = m∑ k = 1 gk (t) x (m --k) (t), h x ≡ (h x) (t) = p∑ j = 0 +1∫ −1 H j (t, s) x (j) (s) d s. Lemma 1. Let the conditions fulfilled: 1) gk, k = 1, m, y ∈ Y; 2) there is a derivative ∂r h j (t, s) ∂t r ∈ L2, QR × L1, J = 0, M −1; 3) There is a derivative ∂r h j (t, s) ∂t r ∈ L2, QR × L2, QM - J, J = M, P. Then the following statements are fair: 1 °. Operator D: X → Y has a continuous reverse D -1: Y → X, moreover, ∥D∥X → Y = ∥D - 1∥y → X = 1. 2®. Operators: X → Y and H: X → Y are quite continuous. Lemma 1 allows you to apply for a close solution of the problem (1), (2) you are a numeral scheme of the gallerkin method, usually used for the tasks correctly set according to Adamar. We first give two auxiliary statements directly arising from the results of the work [2]. Lemma 2. System {tk (t)} φ k = 0 Polynomas of Chebyshev of the first kind forms an ortho gonal basis in the space of Sobolev R L2, QR for any R = 1.2,. . .. Lemma 3. Let x ∈W R l2, qr, r ∈ N, XN (t) - Polin degree N the best with the proximity of the function x (t) in the space of the Lebey L2.1/ρ. Then XN (t) is also a polynoma of the best approximation in the space w l2, qr. Lemms 2 and 3 give us the opportunity to reasonably build polynomial approaches of the solutions of the problem (1), (2). The approximate solution of the problem (1), (2) will be searched in the form of xn (t) = n +m∑ i = m ci (t +1) i, (5) unknown coefficients {ck} which we will determine from the conditions +1∫ - 1 1p 1 - t 2 [(k xn) (t) - y (t)] t l d t = 0, l = 0, n. (6) Yu.R. Agachev, M.Yu. Pershagin 11 Conditions (6) Relatively {ck} are a system of linear algebraic equations of the type n +m∑ i = m αi l ci = yl, l = 0, n, (7) where yl = +1∫ −1 1p 1- t 2 y (t) t l d t, αi l = +1∫ −1 1p 1 - t 2 (k [(t +1) i]) (t) t l d t. (8) The following theorem. Proceedfunction Y, GK, K = 1, M Ih J, J = 0, P, satisfying 1) - 3) Lemma 1. Then the system (7), (8) for all N, starting From a certain number N0, has the only solution {C ∗ i} m+n m. Close decisions x ∗ n, built according to the formula (5) for {ci = c ∗ i}, with n → ∞ are converged according to the norm of space X to the exact solution of X ∗ of the problem (1), (2) with the speed ∥x ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ n∥x = o {en (dx ∗) y}, where en (z) y is the best approximation of the z ∈ Y function by algebraic polynomas of the degree not higher than n. Proof of the theorem is carried out using the option of a general theory
