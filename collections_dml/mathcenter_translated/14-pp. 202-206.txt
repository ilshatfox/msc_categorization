) The geometric properties of some classes of functions in the circle consider class C (α), 0 <α 6 1, analytical in the circle E = {Z: | Z | <1} functions w = f (z) = z + a2z2 +. . ., satisfying the condition ∣∣arg [(1 - z2) f ′ (z)] ∣∣ <απ/2, z ∈ E. (1) class C (α) is the class K (α) almost convex order of α functions f (z) [1], [2], distinguished by the condition ∣∣∣∣arg f ′ (z) g ′ (z) ∣∣∣∣ <απ/2, z ∈ E, (2) where w = g ( Z) - arbitrary convex in E function, since with G (Z) = G0 (Z) = LN [(1 + Z)/(1 - Z)] from (2) the condition (1) is obtained. Therefore, all the functions of class C (α), 0 <α 6 1, are single -leafy and almost convex in E [3]. Let f (z) ∈ C (α). Consider the complex function F (w) = f [g - 10 (w)], analytical in the strip d = {w: | Im w | <π/2}. Then, by virtue of conditions (1) we have | Arg F ′ (W) | <απ/2, W ∈ D. On the basis of this, it is not difficult to establish (see, for example, [4]) that the area f (e) = f (d) is achievable from the outside of the angles of the solution (1–α) π with bisectors parallel imaginary axis. In particular, C (α) ⊂ c (0), and class C (0) coincides with the class of functions [5], convex in the direction of the imaginary axis. From (1) it follows that for the functions f (z) ∈ C (α) there is an integral representation f (z) = z∫ 0 pα (t) 1- t2dt, (3) more than p (z) ∈ P, where - Analytical class in E functions that satisfy the condition p (0) = 1, re p (z)> 0, z ∈ E. 208 Theorem 1. If f (z) ∈ C (α), 0 <α 6 1, then, then In the circle | Z | 6 r there are estimates (1 - R 1 + R) α 1 1 + R2 6 | F ′ (Z) | 6 (1 + R 1 - R) α 1 1 - R2, (4) | F (Z) | 6 1 2 (α + 1) [(1 + r 1 - r) α + 1 - 1], (5) ∣∣∣∣z f ′ ′ (z) f ′ (Z) - 2Z 2 1- Z2 ∣∣ ∣∣ 6 2αR 1 - R2. (6) The assessments are accurate and are achieved for the function f (z) = 1 2 (α + 1) [(1 + z 1 - z) α + 1 - 1]. Proof. By force (3) we have (1- Z2) F ′ (Z) = Pα (Z). Since p (z) ∈ P, subordination takes place ([6], p. 356) p (z) ≺ (1+z)/(1 - Z). Therefore, (1- Z2) F ′ (Z) ≺ (1 + Z 1 - Z) α. (7) Hence for everyone z, | z | 6 r, we have an assessment | (1- Z2) F ′ (Z) | 6 [(1 + r)/(1 - r)] α. Since | 1- Z2 | > 1 - | z | 2, then we get the right from the assessments (4). Due to subordination (7) in the circle | z | 6 r we have (1 - R 1 + R) α 6 ∣∣∣ (1 - Z2) F ′ (Z) ∣∣∣ 6 (1 + R2) | F ′ (Z) |. From here we get the left of the assessments (4). Assessment (5) is obtained from the assessment (4) by integration by the segment of the radius from 0 to R. By virtue of the representation (3) z f ′ ′ (z) f ′ (z) - 2z 2 1 - z2 = αz p ′ (z) p (z). (8) Since p (z) ≺ (1 + z)/(1– Z), then ln p (z) = ln 1 + w (z) 1– w (z), where W (z) satisfies the conditions of lemma Schwartz. Hence Z P ′ (Z) P (Z) = 2ZW ′ (Z) 1- W2 (Z). 209 by virtue of inequality [7] | W ′ (Z) | 6 (1 - | w (z) | 2)/(1 - | z | 2) for all z, | z | 6 r. This means that ∣∣∣∣z p ′ (z) p (z) ∣∣∣∣ 6 2R 1- R2, from where, on the basis of equality (8) we get an estimate (6). Unrequaling assessments is set by a simple check. Assessment (6) allows you to easily find a radius of the bulge of class C (α). It is known that the radius of the bulge R0 of a certain class A of analytical functions F (Z) is called the largest of numbers R, 0 <r <1, ​​such that for each function f (z) ∈ A image of any circumference | z | = R, 0 <r <r0, there is a convex curve. Theorem 2. The radius of the bulge R0 R0 C (α) is defined as the smallest positive root of the equation R4 - 2αR3 - 2R2 - 2αR + 1 = 0. (9) evidence. By virtue of the assessment (6) we get ∣∣∣∣re [z f ′ ′ (z) f ′ (Z) - 2Z 2 1- Z2] ∣∣∣∣ 6 2αR 1 - R2, hence for all z, | z | 6 r, re (z f ′ ′ (z) f ′ (z)> min | z | 6r re (2z2 1– Z2) - 2αR 1 - R2 = - 2R2 1 + R2 - 2αR 1 - R2 = −2R 2 - 2R4 + 2αR + 2αR3 1 - R4 = −1, where R = R0 is the smallest positive root of the equation (9), i.e., in the circle | Z | 6 R0, the convexity of the function f (z) is performed. We show that the radius is radius The bulge is accurate. For the function f0 (z) = z∫ 0 (1 + IZ 1 - IZ) α DZ ​​1 - z2 ∈ C (α) we have z f ′ ′ 0 (z) f ′ 0 (z) = 2Z2 1- Z2 + 2IαZ 1 + Z2. Therefore, at the point Z = IR0 we get Z F ′ ′ 0 (Z) F ′ 0 (Z) = - 2R 2 1 + R2 - 2αR 1 - R2 = −1, 210 tons. It cannot be improved. We denote through the M (α) class of analytical in E functions w = f (z), f (0) = 0, f ′ (0) = 1, such as f (z) = zf ′ (z), where the function f (z) ∈ C (α), 0 <α 6 1. Note that m (α) ⊂ m (1), where m (1) = {f (z): re (1 - z2 z f f. (z))> 0, z ∈ E} and m (1) coincides with the class of typically material functions. For this class, radius of starship is determined in the work of R. Liber [7]. Using the known The relationship between convex and star -shaped functions, expressed by the ratio f (z) ∈ S0 ⇔ F (z) = zf ′ (z) ∈ S ∗, we obtain that the radius of the starship of the class M (α) is determined by the equation (9), and with α = = 1 We get the known result [7]: r ∗ = 1 2 (√ 5 + 1 - √ 2 (√ 5 + 1)) ≈ 0, 345. Theorem 2 can be clarified if it is known that the decomposition of function F (z) in a row Taylor has the passes of members, in particular, if A2 = 0. Then F ′ (Z) = 1 + 3A3Z 2 + ... and P (Z) = [F ′ (Z) (1- Z2)] 1/α = α = α = α = 1 + C2Z2 + C3Z3 + · · ·, Z SHER E. Hence the subordination p (z) ≺ (1 + z)/(1- Z), taking into account the decomposition P (Z), we get grades | P (Z) | 6 1 + R 2 1 - R2, ∣∣∣∣Z P ′ (
