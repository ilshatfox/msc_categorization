Lobachevsky improved the rating of boron for analytical functions F, given in the works ofhi.r. Kayumova and S. Ponnus. Namely, the inequality is proven ∑icles k = 0 | AK | R K + 16 9πsr + λs2r ≤ 1, r ≤ 13, where λ = 18.6095. . . - a positive material root of the equation 55099802888x5–97745285925x4–87178893840x3-37178714880x2–6268596224x - 285212672 = 0 and SR = ∑ motor K = 1 K | AK | 2R 2K - the area of ​​the image of the circle | z | z | z | zh | z | z | z | <r under the influence of the function F, analytical in a single circle D is such that | f (z) | ≤ 1, z ∈ D. The assessment is unreasonable. Key words: analytical functions, geometric theory of functions of a complex alternating, radius of boron. In 1914, Harald Bor proved that if for the function f (z) = ∑icle k = 0 ak z k, determined in the area d: = {z ∈ C: | z | ≤ 1}, condition is fulfilled | f (z) | ≤ 1, then ∑icles k = 0 | ak | r k ≤ 1 for all | z | = R ≤ 16. Further in the works of N. Winer, F. Rice and I. Shura, it was proved that the number 1/6 can be replaced with Constant 1/3, which cannot be increased. Recently I.R. Kayumov, together with S. Ponnus, proved the inequality φ∑ k = 0 | ak | r k + 16 9π sr ≤ 1, r ≤ 1 3, (1) where sr = π ∑icles k = 1 k | 2r 2k is the area - area circle of circle | z | <r under the action of the function f. We managed to improve the assessment (1). Namely, the theorem is fair. Let the analytical in the circle D function f (z), such that f (z) = ∑icle k = 0 ak z k s. Kalirai, S. Ponnusov, V.V. Starkov 167 and | f (z) | ≤ 1 in D. Then the inequality is fair φ∑ k = 0 | AK | R k + 16 9π SR + λs2R ≤ 1, R ≤ 1 3, where λ = 18.6095. . . - a positive material root of the equation 5509980288x5 −97745285925x4 −87178893840x3 −37178714880x2 −6268596224x - - 285212672 = 0. The resulting assessment is unreasonable. An Improviment of Bohr’s Inequality for Analytic Functions A.A. ISMAGILOV, I.R. Kayumov, S. Ponnusamy, A.V. Kaymova, N.Z. SHAKIROV We IMPROVE BOHR’S Inequality for Analytic Functions F Which Was Investigated by I.R. Kaymov and S. Ponnusami. PRECISYLY, The Following Inequality IS Prved: ∑icles K = 0 | AK | R K + 16 9πSR + λS2R ≤ 1, R ≤ 13, What λ = 18.6095. . . is the positive solution to the equation 5509980288x5−97745285925x4−87178893840x3− 37178714880x2−6268596224x−285212672 = 0 and Sr =π  ∑∞ k=1 k|ak |2r 2k is the area of ​​the image of the  disk |z| <R Under the Mapping F, Analytic in the Unit Disk D and Satispying | f (z) | <1, Z ∈ D.

For functions from the S0H, the exact assessment is not known even in the case of | A2 |. The purpose of this work is to receive assessments (not accurate) | An | <5.24 × 10–6N17 and | BN | <2.32 × 10–7N17 for all n ≥ 3 and f = ∈ S0H, and the assessments of the radii of one -leafness of partial sums of single -leaf harmonic display were also obtained. We received assessments of the radius of single -leafness of partial amounts of normalized single -leaf -harmonic displays of a single circle to convex, star -shaped, almost convex, convex in the direction of the region. In the case of display to convex areas, the result is accurate. Keywords: harmonic one -leaf functions, partial amounts, coeff
