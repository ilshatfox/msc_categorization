Kurina1, M.A. Kalashnikova2 1 kurina@math.vsu.ru; Voronezh State University, Federal Research Center "Informatics and Management" of the Russian Academy of Sciences 2 Margarita.kalashnikova@mail.ru; ATOS ITOS SOLUSHENS AND Service in the article presents a brief overview of publications devoted to asymptotic analysis of the tasks of optimal management with multi -standard fast variables. Keywords: optimal control, singular disturbances, different -aimed fast variables, asymptotic decays. When constructing an asymptotic solution to the problems of optimal control, two approaches are used (see, for example, [1]). The first of them is to build an asymptotic solution to the problem arising from the conditions of management optimality. Another approach, called a direct scheme, consists in the direct substitution of the postulated asymptotic decomposition of the solution in the condition of the problem and build a series of tasks of optimal management to find members of asymptotica. Asimptotic behavior of solving the problem of minimizing the quadratic functionality j = 1/2 +inous (y ′ y +u′ru) d t, r> 0, y = c0x +n∑ j = 1 c j, (1) on the trajectories of the linear system d x /d t = a0x + n∑ j = 1 a0 j z j + b0u, x (0) = x0, εi d zi /d t = ai 0x + n∑ j = 1 ai j z j + bi u, zi (0) = zi 0 I = 1, N, (2) In the case of constant coefficients and small parameters εI of the same order of 210, the materials of the school-conference was studied under certain conditions in [2] on the basis of asymptotic solutions to the algebraic matrix equation of Rickati, which has the structure K = K (ε) = (K1 (ε) µ (ε) k2 (ε) µ (ε) k ′ 2 (ε) µ (ε) k3 (ε)), where the stroke means transponing, µ (ε) = (ε1 ... εn ) 1/n. In [3] it is proved that the value of the quality criterion for the constructed approximation of optimal control in the form of feedback, which does not depend on small parameters, differs from the optimal one by the magnitude of the order ε21 + ... + ε2n. This article also considers a critical (non -standard) case, when a quick variable state cannot be unambiguously expressed from its equation with the zero value of the small parameter. We note here an article [4], where a critical case was studied for the task (1) (2) using the concept of block D-detectivity and a block d-stabilization. For the system system (2) in the case when ε0 = 1, lim ε → 0 εk+1/εk = 0, ε = (ε1, ..., εn), in [5] suboptimal stabilizing control in the form of feedback was built , minimizing quadratic functionality on an endless gap. The task of the optimal linear regulator minimizing the quadratic functionality j = 1/2x (1) ′ f x (1) +1/2 1∫ 0 (x (t) ′ q (t) x (t)+u (t) ′ ′ R (t) u (t)) d t, x = (x ′ 1, x ′ 2, x ′ 3) ′, on the trajectories of a three -a -a -a -a -line linear system with variable coefficients D X1/D T = A11x1 + A12X2 + A13X3 + B1U, εD X2/D T = A21X1 + A22X2 + A23X3 + B2U, εµD X3/D T = A31X1 + A32X2 + A33X3 + B3U (3) with a fixed left end, is considered in [6, p. 195-200]. The optimal management for this task has the form U = −R -1B ′ K Y, where k politatively defined solution of the matrix differential equation of Rickati dk /d t = −k a - a of a′k +k sk q, s = Br - 11B ′, with the final condition K (1, ε, µ) = f. Here A =    A12 A13A21/ε A22/ε A23/ε A31/εµ A32/εµ A33/εµ  , b =   b1b2/ε b3/εµ  . Provided that F =   f11 εf12 εµf13f ′12 εf22 εµf23 εµF ′13 ′ 23 εµf33  is a logical form, its blocks Ki J, J = 1.3, I = 1, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, J, JA, They must satisfy a three -a -a -aMA -silly indignant system. Under some conditions, asymptic diversity, asymptotic splitting of equations and final conditions is made to build an asymptotic solution of this system. G.A. Kurina, M.A. Kalashnikova 211 algorithm for bringing to the block diagonal form a linear non -stationary controlled system with multipliers with derivatives (3) is described in [6, p. 146-148]. In this case, splitting transformations are sought in the form of asymptotic decays. Here is the algorithm of the direct scheme method for an asymptotic solution of the non -linear problem of optimal control with three -a -aimed variables of the state JO (u) = t∫ 0 f (x, u, t, ε) d t → min, x = (x ′ 1, x ′ 2, x ′ 3) ′, εi - 1d XI /D T = FI (X, U, T, ε), XI (0) = x0i, I = 1.3. (4) Using the ideas of the method of borderline functions from [7], we look for the solution to the problem (4) in the form of decomposition V (t, ε) = v (t, ε)+ 1∑ i = 0 (πi v (τi, ε)++ Qi v (σi, ε)), v = (x ′, u ′) ′, (5) where v (t, ε) = ∑ j runes, t ∈ [0, t], τi = t/εi+1 ≥ 0, σi = (t –t)/εi+1 ≤ 0, πi v (τi, ε) = ∑ j runes theε Jπi j v (τi), qi v (σi, ε) = ∑ j ≥0ε j qi j v (σi), i = 0.1, v j (t) - regular functions from
