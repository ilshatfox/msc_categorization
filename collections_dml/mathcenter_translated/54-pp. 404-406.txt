Materials of the International School-Conference of UDC 517.518.83 On the impact of the shift of the argument of the approaching function on the quality of approximation of the constant Labbeg operator Fourier I.A. Shakirov1 1 ISKANDER@TATNGPI.ru; Naberezhnye Chelninsky State Pedagogical University for the constant of the Lebeg of the operator Fourier received well -defined close representations. The errors of approximation are estimated in uniform discrete metric, when the corresponding residual members belong to various classes. Keywords: the norm of the operator Fourier, asymptotic equality, the residual member of the Lebeg Constant, the best approximation of the Lebeg Constant. Classic operator Fourier SN: C2π → C2π gives the Constant Lebaga ln = ∥sn∥ = 2 π ˆ π 2 0 | sin (2n +1) t | sin t d t, n ∈ N (l0 = 1, l1 = 1 3 + 2 p 3 π = 1.4359912..). (1) In the first half of the last century by L. Feier, G. Sege, Hardy, various formulas were installed to calculate the value of Constant (1): ln = 1 2n +1 + 2 π n∑ k = 1 k tg πk 2n 2n +1, ln = 16 π2 +φ∑ k = 1 (1 4k2 −1 (2n +1) k∑ m = 1 1 2m −1), ln = 4 ˆ و (2n +1) t th t · d t π2 +4t 2, ln = 4 π2 ˆ و (2n +1) t sh t · ln [ctgh ((n +0.5) t)] d t. They have an important theoretical value, but are difficult to calculate the values ​​of the Lebeg constant. Therefore, the search for simple approximate formulas, allowing to calculate the LN Constant with a fairly small error, is an urgent task. In 1910, L. Feier specified the behavior of the constant (1) of the type LN = O (LNN), establishing a more accurate asymptotic equality LN ≡ L (N) = 4 π2 lnn +O (1) (N → ∞). (2) Since then, an assessment of the values ​​of O (1) in (2), from below and from above, searching for the element of the best uniform (discrete) approximation of the type 4 π2 ln (n+a)+b (a, b ∈ R+0 = 0 = 0 = 0 = [0,+∞)) Many mathematicians were engaged in LN. However, the task of determining the best coefficients a = a ∗, b = b ∗ in the approximate equality of ln ≈ 4 π2 ln (n+a)+b, n ∈ N ((a, b) ∈ω = R+0 × R+0) (3) I.A. Shakirov 405 still remains an unresolved problem of the theory of functions. For classes of strictly increasing (M +) and strictly decreasing (m -) residual members (functions of the argument n and parameters a, b) type ON (A, B) = LN - 4 π2 ln (n +a) —B, n ∈ N ((a, b) ∈) (4) recently the author obtained the following results. Theorem 1 [1]. In the approximate equality (3) the best uniform approximation of the lebe constant in the class m - = {on (a, b) | (a, b) ∈ - = [0.1/2] × [0.3/2] ⊂ω } It is achieved at the values ​​of the parameters A = A - = 0.5 and B = B - = 1.2710077. . ., i.e. steam (a -, b -) & - is a solution to the extreme problem Inf (a, b) ∈ω - SUP norn ∣∣∣∣LN - 4π2 ln (n +a) −b ∣∣∣∣ = sup n ∈N ∣∣∣∣LN - 4π2 ln (n +a -) - b - ∣∣∣∣ = ε - = 0.00065453. . . . (5) Theorem 2 [2]. Entertaining equality (3) The best uniform approximation of the lebe constant in the class m+ = {on (a, b) | (a, b) ∈ω+ = [a+,+ ger] × [0, 3 2] ⊂ω} is achieved at the values ​​of the parameters A = A+ = 0.51188859. . . and b = b+ = 1.26940801. . ., i.e. steam (a+, b+) ∈ω+is a solution to the extreme problem of inf (a, b) ∈ω+SUP n] ∣∣∣∣ln - 4π2 ln (n+ a+) - b+ ∣∣∣∣ = ε+ = 0.00094523. . . . (6) From these theorems it is clear that the behavior of the residual members remains unexplored in the class m 0 = {on (a, b) | (a, b) ∈rapa = (1 2, a+) × [0, 3 2] ⊂ω }, where they can be strictly increasing or waning, or general form functions. We indicate a well -defined ON function (A0, B0) of a common type from M 0, for which the following result takes place. Theorem 3. For the residual member (A0, B0) ∈ M 0 with parameters A0 = EXP (π2 l1 −α0 4) −1 = 0.50485280. . . , b0 = α0, there is an assessment of Inf (a, b) &0 sup n] 4π2 ln (n +a0) −α0 ∣∣∣∣ = ε0 = 0.00031763. . . , (7) where α0 = limn → φ [ln - 4π2 lnn] = 1.27035324. . . - The famous constant Watson. Note 1. The combination of quantities (5) - (7) shows that in thetheom 3 the results of the previous two are more than doubled: ε–/ε0 = 2.06. . . , ε+/ε0 = 2.97. . . . Note 2. In class M 0, there is no residual member that coincides everywhere in N with Constant LN. 406 Materials of the International School-Conference Literature 1. Shakirov I.A.
