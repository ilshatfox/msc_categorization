As an application, new results are given about the representations of positive normal functionals on algebra von Neumann. L.V. Veselova, An.N. Novikov, O.E. Tikhonov 85 keywords: positive functionality, space with the base norm, space with a ordinal unit, algebra von Neumann, weight, almost dominant functionality, singular functionality, and the decomposition of the Lebag. This work is initiated by the approach of A. N. Sherstnev to the theory of integration of relatively normal functionals and weights on algebra von Neumann (see [9, 10]), as well as the solution of the dual problem of building spaces of type L1, associated with positive self -harmonized operators annexed to algebra von Neumann [1, 3]. It seems natural to receive a number of designs and statements as particular cases of a more general approach within the framework of ordered vector spaces, which is implemented in section 1. Section 2 shows how some statements of section 1 together with the known statements of the theory of non -commutative integration allow you to get new results about the ideas of positive normal normal Functionals on algebras von Neumann. 1. The space with the base norm and the space with the ordinal unit, associated with the positive functionality, are the X + - the cone of positive elements in a positively generated ordered vector space X above R. Let F - algebraically associated with x and f + - conjugated cone of positive linear functionals on X . For f ∈ F+, we put J f = {g ∈ F: –λ f ≤ g ≤λ f for some λ ∈R+}. It is easy to check that J F is a linear subspace F, the cone j + f = j f ∩f + spray gives j f and that f is the serial unit in j f ãîùù Moreover, the formula ∥g∥ f = Inf {λ≥ 0: –λ f ≤ g ≤λ f} defines the norm on j f, which turns J f into a full space with an orderly unit. The corresponding single ball {g ∈ F: - f ≤ g ≤ f} denote j f, 1. For such f ∈ ​​F+, we introduce the midnight R f on x: r f (x) = Inf {f (x ′)+ f (x ′ ′): x ′, x ′ ′ ∈ X+; x = x ′ −x ′ ′} (1) and put: x f, 0 = {x ∈ X: r f (x) = 0}, x f, 1 = {x ∈ X: r f (x) ≤ 1} . It is clear that r f (x) = f (x) for x ∈ X +. Sentence [4]. Polyara X ° F, 1 is J F, 1. Theorem 1.1. Let the y — such a subspace of space F, that the canonical bilinear form 〈x, f〉 puts in the duality X and Y, and let J f ⊂ y. Midnight R F is the norm of the second -hand, the case when j f is tightly vy second -poology σ (y, x). Mark 1. Let X - an ordered banakh space with a closed generating cone X +. If F is a positive linear functionality on X, then 86 materials of the International School-Conference F are automatically limited and J f is the linear subspace of the related ordered banakh space X ∗. Theorem 1.1 says in this case that the Rem R f to X is the norm and only when J f *-Slavbo is tightly in X ∗. If you take Ermitov as a part of the algebra von Neumann, and in ka, the accurate is the exact positive
