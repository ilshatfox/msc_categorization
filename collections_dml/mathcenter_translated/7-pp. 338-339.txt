. Construction of the circuit according to the distributions of mass concentration and stream of substance A.Yu. Khasanov, the Kazan Financial and Economic Institute Econot@kfei. In the late 70s of our centuries, KCN.Riy, the reverse edge task was set for the equation of stationary heat transfer according to the boundary conditions of the I and 11 clans. The solution to this problem in the assumption of the symmetry of the desired semi -norfront circuit was implemented in the work [1]. The method of constructing an unknown circuit set forth in it is taking Lem to solve the reverse edge problem for the equation of stationary mass exchange. The possibility of this application is due to the fact that in the condition of the inpatient thermal power supply, the equation of the transfer of mass concentration of the substance is similar to the equation of heat transfer. With a turn of the surfaces by applying or removing the substance, it can be accepted that the flow of the substance is proportional to the concentration gradient. Staging. Determine the symmetrical semi -pointed end of the tour, streamlined by the potential stream of electrolyte, which has the properties of an ideal inconspicuous fluid, according to the equalized distribution of mass concentration and the removal of a substance with 338 of the upper of this contour, determined by the values ​​of the gradient of the concentration of the tension. The solution to this problem is carried out by the method set forth in [1], and can be applied when designing the cathode-tool for the gas on the surface of the metal layer substrate. Literature 1.
