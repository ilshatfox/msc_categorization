) The oscillative function substantiation for periodic regional tasks is considered the periodic regional task of AX ≡ x (s) + b (x; s) = y (s), − least <s <mm, (1) x (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (k) (K) 0) = x (k) (2π), k = 0, m - 1, m + 1 ∈ N, (2) where y ∈ L2 (0, 2π) ≡ l2 is given, x ∈ WM2 (0, 2π) ≡ WM2 - the desired functions, B: WM2 → L2 - this linear limited (including integro -radio) operator, and the AC = 0 Conditions (2) are absent. The approximate solution of the problem (1) - (2) is searched in the form of a polynoma xn (s) = n∑ k = −n αke Iks, αk ∈ C, n + 1 ∈ N, (3) the coefficients of which are determined by the method of oscilizing functions [1 ] From the system of linear algebraic equations (SLAU) n∑ k = −n arkαk = yr, r = 0, 2n, (4) ark = sr+1∫ sr a (eiks; s) ds, yr = sr+1∫ sr y (s) ds, sr = 2πr 2n + 1. (5) 104 Theorem 1. Let the operator B: WM2 → L2 is quite continuous. If the task (1) - (2) has the only solution x ∗ (s) ∈ WM2 for any y (s) ∈ L2, then with all n ∈ N, starting with some, SLAU (4) - (5) is also unambiguously resolved . Approximate solutions (3) converge to the exact solution X ∗ in the space of WM2 with a speed of ‖x ∗ - xn‖w m2 ³ E t n (x ∗ (m) L2, (6) where etn (ψ) l2 is the best approximation in L2 The functions ψ ∈ L2 with all kinds of trigonometric polynomas of the order are not higher than N. Theorem 2. In the conditions of theorem 1, the method of oscilling functions (1) - (5) is stable [2] relatively small disturbances of the coefficients of the SLAU (4) - (5) and optimal in order [2] among all kinds of polynomial methods for solving the problem (1) - - (2).
