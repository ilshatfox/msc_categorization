Resolvent Equation Pain Terr A with a variable unequal core, consider the equation t x (t) = j k (t -) x (s) ds + f (t), t?: O, o, o, about where x (t), and t), and t) and t (t) and t) and t (t) and t) and t (t), and t) and t (t) and t), and K (t) - continuous on [o, oo) functions. In the case of E L 1 [0, OO), asymptotic structure rezole Ruena R nuclei is studied quite well (see “eg” [1]-[2]). l, for also, for unequal nuclei of the type K (t) = 2: sprick (t) eµ • 1 + k = l ko (t), where pn.

We will designate p0 (t) = 2: ckt "'• non -k = l Visimo from the coefficients of CK, degrees OK and their number. Consider the core K (t) = KO (t) + K1 (t) + K2 (t) + ... + kp (t), where k0 (t) e l 1 [0, oo), kj (t) = e>. ... 'p. In this case, the core is K (t) rf. L 1 [0, oo). Multiplying the operator I - to the left by a certain operator I + ё, we get (1 - k) (! + E) = I - I, where l is the operator of the bundle with the core L (t) = k (t) - g (t) +k* g (t). N Lemma. There is quasi -martyr G (t) = e -t 2: gktk k = o such that the nucleus L (t) of the operator L is a summarized function. Thus, the equation with the unexpressed nucleus K (t) of the indicated type can be reduced to the equation with the summarized core 225 L (t), the dpi can be found to be found to the resolventor RL (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) (t) See [1] - [2]). Further from the equality of Rk (t) = rl (t) + g (t) + (rl * g) (t) there is a resolver Rk (t) nuclei k (t). Literature. Literature 1. Derbenev V. A "Tsalyuk 3. b.
