Uniforms of one algebraic surface D.S. Safarov1 1 Safarov-5252@mail.ru; Bokhtar State University, Tajikistan in the work found a parametric representation of decisions of one algebraic surface using generalized elliptical functions of the Weerstrass. Keywords: quasi -carcereidic, quasiconic, elliptical functions. In the complex space C3, we consider the algebraic equation of the type W2 = Z1 (A1Z31 +A2Z22 +A3Z +A4), (1) where Z1, Z2 are independent complex variables, A1, A2, A3, A4 - complex constant, moreover, polynomial G (Z2) = A1Z31+A2Z22+A3Z+A4 does not have multiple roots. Equation (1) for Z1 = 1 is called an equation of an algebraic curve [1]. The task of uniforms of the algebraic surface (1) is to represent the solutions of the equation (1) in the form of z1 = onic (z), z2 = χ (z), w = ψ (z), (2) where ∗ (z), χ (z), χ z), ψ (z) - unambiguous differentiated functions of a complex alternating z. Using linear replacement [1] z2 = 4 A1 (τ - A2 12), W = 4 A1 W1 (3) equation (1) is led to the type W21 = Z1 (4τ3 - G2τ - G3), (4) where G2 = where g2 = where g2 = 1 12 (A22 −3A1A3), G3 = 1 432 (9A1A2A3 −2A32 −27A21A4). Equation (4) for Z1 = 1 is unified using the Elliptical functions of the Weerstrass ℘ (u), ℘ ′ (u). Therefore, with Z1 = 1 algebraic curves of the form (1), (4) are called elliptical. If the G2, G3 are invariants of the Weerstrasse function ℘ (u) = 1 u2 +∑ | m | +| ̸ = 0 [1 (u –mω1 —nω2) 2 - 1 (mω1 +nω2) 2] i.e. ℘′2 (u) = 4℘3 (u) - g2℘ (u) - g3, then equation (4) at Z1 = 1 allows a parametric representation of solutions in the form [1] z2 = 4a1 (℘ (u) - a212 ), w1 = 4℘ ′ (u) a1. (4 ′) 302 Materials of the School-Conference in this case for periods ω1, ω2 are equal to 60 ∑ ′ (m1ω1 +m2ω2) −4 = g2, 140 ∑ ′ (m1ω1 +m2ω2) −6 = g3, (5) and IM (IM (5) (5) (5) (5) ω2/ω1)> 0. The equality (4 ′) establishes a mutually unambiguous correspondence between the points of the algebraic curve (4) and the points of the parallelogram of periods ω function ℘ (u). With z1 ̸ = 1, we find the parametric solution of the equation (1) using generalized two -cordic ones, with periods ω1, ω2 the solution of the equation by the underwear [3]: uction q (z) uction = 0, (6) where q (z) is two -acereodic from periods ω1, ω2 differentiated function of class C 2 (ω) ∩C 1 (ω), satisfying the condition | Q (Z) | ≤ Q0 <1. (7) Such solutions of equations (6) are called generalized elliptical functions [5], [6]. To do this, it is necessary to find a quasi -aidic quasi -fifter display of the region ω, satisfying the condition ∗ (0) = 0, onic (z +m1ω1 +m2ω2) = onic (z) +m1ω1 −m2ω2, (8) where M1, m2 = 0, ± 1, ± 2, ... as you know [2, 3], the quasiconform display of the region ω is understood as a generalized homeomorphic solution w (z) = f (z) equations (6). Differentiated display ∗ (Z), satisfying the condition (8), is called the main quasi -pieridic homeomorphism. In [5, 6] it was shown that under the assumed conditions on the function Q (Z), the equation (6) always admits the only solution of class C 2, satisfying the condition (8), in the form of wor (z) = z +tζρ (z) = z - 1 π ï ω ρ (t) ζ (t - z) dtω, (9) where the two -income function ρ (t) with the periods of theω1, ω2 is a solution to the symbolic integral equation of the form ρ --qsζρ = Q, (10) in which in which (Sζρ) = (tζρ) z =-1 π ï ρ ρ (t) ℘ (t-z) dtω, ℘ (z)-"PE" -function of Weerstrass and integral is understood in the sense of the main value. Since in [4-6] it is proved that tζ: {ρ ∈ L ∗ p, ï ω ρdω = 0}-→ ∗ W 1 p, p> 2, d.s. Safarov 303 where l ∗ p, ∗ w 1 p, p> 2 is the space of two -income function belonging respectively in LP (ω), W 1P (ω), p> 2, and || Sζ || L2 = 1, then in Power Condition (7) The equation has the only solution at | p −2 | <ε, ε> 0: ρ (z) = (1–qsζ) −1q (z). If the condition ω ω (1–qsζ) −1q (z) dω = 0, (11) is fulfilled, the function onic (z) is the only quasi -aodic differentiated quasi -hiccup of the parallelogram ω with the peaks 0, ω1, ω1 +ω2, ω2 to the quadrangle ′ ′ ′ with vertices 0, ω1, ω1 +ω2, ω2. On the plane of the quasi -peridic quasiciforno display of the equation by the underwear, it is possible to determine the so -called generalized elliptical functions of the Weerstrass ℘ (gment (z)), ζ (gment (z)), σ (gment), [5,6] and function ℘ (С z)) satisfies the differential equation ℘′2 (gment (z)) = 4℘3 (gment (z)) - g2℘ (gment (z)) - G3, with invariants G2, G3. Since the construction uction = ρ (z), the following theorem. Let the G2, G3, determined through the coefficients on G (Z2), are invariants of the ℘ (u) and q (z) function - a bicopperiodic differentiated function with periods ω1, ω2, satisfying the condition (7). Let ∗ (Z) - the main quasi -pieridic homeomorphism of the equation by the underwear, determined by the formula (9), uction = ρ (z) and ρ (z) - the solution of the integral equation (10) and the condition (11) is fulfilled. Then the equation (1) allows a parametric representation of solutions in the form of z1 = ρ2 (z), z2 = 4 a1 (℘ (С)) - a2 12), w = 4℘ ′ (С) a1 ρ (z) ρ (z ). Literature 1. Gurvitz A., Karant R.
