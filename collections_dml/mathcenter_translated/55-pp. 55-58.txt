UDC 519.7 On some schemes of partial darkened signatures using the complexity of the problem of a discrete logarithm A.I. Ziyatdinova1 1 aiziyatdinova@ksu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N. I. Lobachevsky provides new examples of partial darkened digital signatures based on the complexity of the task of a discrete logarithm. Key words: darkened digital signatures, partial darkened signatures, the task of a discrete logarithm. A variety of darkened digital signatures (either blind, or signatures blindly) [1] are partial darkened signatures [2]. There are quite a few examples of such signatures, including the problem of a discrete logarithm based on complexity (see, for example, [3]). In our work, two more examples of signatures of this type are described. A feature of partial darkened signatures (Partelly Blind Signatures) is that for signing along with a darkened value (this may be an electronic banknote identifier), an open parameter is sent, which is used in the signing algorithm in the article [4] Signatures similar to the digital signature of the el. Gamal. The authors represent some types of signatures that are most effective for the client - the buyer and signing - the bank. Consider these signatures schemes. 56 Materials of the Youth School-Conference are given two open large simple numbers P, Q, and Q | P −1. In the field zp = {0.1.2 ,. . . , p −1} The open element α of the order q was selected. For a digital signature, a random number SA ∈ Z ∗ P - 1 is selected and P is calculated P A = αSA (Mod P). In this case, SA is a secret key to the signing, and P A is an open key. These values ​​remain constant for all signed messages. To sign the message m ∈ ZP -1, the signing selects the random number k ∈ZP -1, calculates R = αk (mod p) and solves the equation S ≡ SA (m + r) −k (mod (p −1)) (∗) relative to the parameter s. Troika (M; R, S) - signed message. The correctness of the signature can be carried out by checking the equality of RαS ≡ PM+Ra (mod p). Further, the authors [4] represent some other options for the Meta-El-Hamal digital signatures, which are as effective as the scheme discussed above. To sign the message, the client calculates the equation, and the bank checks the validity of the corresponding comparison presented in the next list: (1) S = (M + R) SA + K; αs ≡ pm +ra r, (2) s = sa +k (m +r); αs ≡ p ar m+r, (3) s = sa (m+r)+k −m; αm +s ≡ pm +ra r, (4) s = Sa +K (m +r) −m; αm+S ≡ p ar M+R, (5) S = S = SA (M+R)+K - R; αr +s ≡ pm +ra r, (6) s = SA +K (m +R) - R; αr+s ≡ p ar m+r. Consider the darkened version of the digital signature (∗). In this case, there are three participants in the protocol, of which only two are important for us: the bank that signs, and the client (Alice), who withdraws money from the account and sends the bank a darkened identifier m. When the bank signed this identifier, the client removes the darkening and receives an electronic banknote (E-Cash). We will sign the diagram in detail. 1) the bank (signing) generates a random number k̃ ∈ZQ, calculates R̃ ≡αk̃ (mod p) and sends R̃ to the client. 2) The client, in turn, selects random numbers a, b ∈ ZQ and calculates R = R̃ Aαb (mod p) and m̃ = a - 1 (m+r) −r̃ (mod Q). The calculated m̃ is sent to the bank. 3) The bank signs the darkened message m̃, calculating s̃ = sn (m̃ + r̃) - k̃ (mod Q). Then S̃ is sent to the client. 4) The client calculates S = as̃ −b (Mod Q) by the signed message (electronic banknote) is the three (M; R, S). In order to find out whether the signature is correct, you need to check the following comparison: αSR ≡ pm+rn (mod p), or αs ≡ pm+Rn R -1 (mod p). A.I. Ziythdinova 57 will further consider signatures (1) and (3) from the list presented above. Therefore, imagine their darkened options that are offered in [4]: ​​(1) m̃ = a - 1 (m + r) - r̃, s = as̃ + b; (3) m̃ = a - 1 (m + r) - r̃, s = a (m̃ + s̃) + b −m. The tests remain the same, as the corresponding to the interpreted versions: in case (1): αS ≡ pm+rn r, in case (3): αs+m ≡ pm+rn r, or αs ≡ pm+Rn Rα --M. In the process of checking the signatures, inaccuracies in the work were revealed [4]. Therefore, we had to slightly modify some data in these two versions. Firstly, in both cases, the R calculated by the client will change. It will have the form: r = r̃ - aαb. Secondly, an unknown signature will change in the version (3), which
