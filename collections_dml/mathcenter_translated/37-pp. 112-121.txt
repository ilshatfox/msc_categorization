The tensors of curvature of induced group connectedness in the variety of centered planes in the N-dimensional space PN will continue to study the variety of BR of the centered M-somnic planes l ∗ m = (a, lm) [1], [2]. In the work, the indices accept the following values: i, j. . . = 1, r; a, b. . . = 1, m; α, β. . . = m + 1, n. With the variety of BR, the main stratification of GS (BR) is associated [1]. In this stratification, the reception of Lumista sets group connectivity, determined by the field of the object of coherence γ = {γabi, γαβi, γaαi, γai, γαi}. The object of curvature of group coherence r = {rabij, rαβij, raαij, raij, rαij} is expressed through the components of the object γ and their pfafovs derivatives, for example, rabij = γ a b [i, j] - γc b [i γa | c | j]. The object of curvature forms a tensor containing 4 simple shades corresponding to the toch objects γ. A strong affinity of diversity consists in the task of the fields of the analogues of the planes of the Cartan 113 CN-M-1 = [Bα] and the normals of the 2nd genus Norden Nm-1 = [BA] and is determined by the field of quasiTinsor λ = {λa, λaα, λα}. The differentials of the points of the equipment of the equipment can be represented in the form (cf. [3]): dbα = θbα + (..) Β αbβ + t a αiθ iba + t̂αiθ ia, dba = θba + (...) B Abb + t α aiθ Ibα ​​+ Taiθ IA, where θi is the basic forms of diversity Br, t = {taαi, tαi, tαai, TAI, T̂αI} - tensor of non -special displacements, and t̂αi = tαi - λataαi. The conditions Taαi = 0, t̂αi = 0 characterize the immobility of the plane of the cardan CN-M-1, and TAI = 0-the displacement of the normal 2nd kind nm-1 in the hyperploster of the on-board PN-1 = CN-1 ⊕ nm-1. Theorem 1. Strong affectionate of the variety of BR induces in the main stratification of GS (BR) six types of group connectedness. In this work, expressions of the components of the curvature of the curvature R for each of these types of induced ligaments were found. For example, for ligaments of the 1st type 01 γ and the 2nd type 02 γ, we have: 01 R = {0 Rabij, 0 rαβij, 01 Raαij, 01 Riij, 01 Rαij}, 02 R = {0 Rabij, 0 Rαβij, 02 Raαij, 02 raij, 02 rαij} 0 rabij = t α b [it a | α | j] - δab λα [i t̂ | α | j] + ma [it | j] + Δab m c [it | c [it | c [it | c [it | | j], 0 rαβij = –tαa [ita | β | j] - λα [i t̂ | β | j] + δαβ (ma [it | j] + λ γ [i t̂ | γ | j]), 01 raij = 0 rbaij λb + t α a [it̂ | α | j], 01 raαij = 0 r αij λ a β - 0 rabij λ b α + m a [i t̂ | α | J], (1) 01 Rαij = 0 r β αij λβ - 01 raij λ a α + λam a [i t̂ | α | j], 02 raij = 0 rbaij λb, 114 02 raαij = 0 r αij λ a β - 0 rabij λ b α, 02 rαij = 0 r β αij λβ - 02 raij λ a α, where λ = {λAi, λαi, λαij} is the fundamental tensor of diversity Br, mai = λ β i λ a β -λai - tensor. Theorem 2. To contact the zero of the tensor of curvature of any of the six types of induced group connectedities, the immobility of the plane of the CN-M-1 plane is sufficient with the fulfillment of at least one of the two conditions: 1) displacement of the 2nd kind NM-1 normal in Bortolotti hyperplotti PN -1; 2) appeal to zero tensor MAI. Theorem 3. For the coincidence of the tensors of the curvature of all six types of induced ligaments, the execution of at least one of the two conditions is enough: 1) the displacement of the plane of the cardan CN-M-1 and the normal of the 2nd kind NM-1 in the hyperploty PN-1; 2) the immobility of the plane of the cardan cn - m - 1.
