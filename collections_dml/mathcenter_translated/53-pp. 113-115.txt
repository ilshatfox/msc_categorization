-Partments associated with the positive elements of the algebra of operators, BE -Operator, annexed to the algebra of von man man M, operating in the Hilbert space h. Through l1 (a), licles (a), the spaces introduced in the work [1] are marked. The subset of the I set MPR is called orthoidal in MPR if the following conditions are met: (i) q 6 p ∈ I, Q ∈ MPR = ⇒ Q ∈ I, (II) p, Q ∈ I, PQ = 0 = ⇒ P+ Q ∈ I . Let I - Ortoidal in MPR. Display µ: i → R+, which satisfies the conditions p = ∑ i et Pi (pi ∈ I, pipj = 0, i 6 = j) = ⇒ µ (p) = ∑ i eth µ (pi), 114 an. An. Novikov is called a measure in Ortoidal I. Measure µ on I is called regular, if there is a normal weight ψ on m such that ψ (p) = µ (p) (p ∈ I). Let ψ - a normal semi -endless trace on the algebra of von Neumann M, which satisfies the condition ψ (a) < +φ. Then the formula φψ (b) = ψ (b1) - ψ (b2) (B1, B2 ∈ LSAU (A) ∩M +; B = B1 - B2) correctly determines the element φψ in l + 1 (a). Theorem 1. Let A - inexpected positive opera Rator from m. Then mpr∩lsaurb (a) = IA - orthoidal in MPR. For each φ ∈ LH1 (A) Display µφ: IA → R, determined by equality µφ (p) = φ (p) is quite additive. Display φ 7 → µφ (φ ∈ LH1 (A)) is injective. Consequence 1. If φ ∈ L+1 (A), then µφ is a semi -inferior measure on orthoidal IA. Investigation 2. Let φ - the element l+1 (a) and ψ is the normal semi -visible weight on m such that µφ = ψ | IA. Then φ = φψ. Theorem 2. Let A - a positive injective nuclear operator in a separate Hilbert space H, and b (h) denotes the algebra von Neumann all limited operators operating in the Hilbert space h. There is an irregular semi -ended measure on Ortoi deale IA in b (h) PR, which can be represented as the difference in two regular semi -endless measures on IA. An. AN.N. Novikov 115 l and t.
