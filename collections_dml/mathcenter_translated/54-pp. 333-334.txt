Reverse tasks to determine the right parts of the equation of mixed parabolo-hyperbolic type with a degenerate parabolic part of S.N. Sidorov1 1 STSID@mail.ru; Sterlitamak branch of the Institute of Stretgic Studies of the Republic of Belarus, Sterlitamak branch of the Bashkir State University studied the reverse tasks to determine the dubious parts of the equation of mixed parabolo-hyperbolic type, depending on time. On the basis of the theory of integral equations, the corresponding theorems of the uniqueness and existence of decisions have been proved. Keywords: the equation of mixed parabolo-hyperbolic type, reverse tasks, existence, unity. In the rectangular area d = {(x, t) | 0 <x <l, −α <t <β}, consider the mixed type LU = f (x, t) equation, (1) where lu = {t nuxx chet - B2T NU, T> 0, UXX −UT T −B2U, T <0, F (X, T) = {F1 (X) G1 (T), T> 0, F2 (X) G2 (T), T < 0, N> 0, b ≥ 0, l> 0, α> 0, β> 0 - specified values. Task 1. Find the functions u (x, t) and g1 (t) that satisfy the conditions: u (x, t) ∈C (d) ∩c 1t (d) ∩c 1x (d) ∩c 2x (d+) ∩ ∩ C 2 (D -); (2) g1 (t) ∈C [0, β]; (3) lu (x, t) ≡ f (x, t), (x, t) ∈ D+∪d -; (4) u (0, t) = u (l, t) = 0, −α≤ t ≤β; u (x, −α) = 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ l; (5) u (x0, t) = h1 (t), 0 <x0 <l, 0 ≤ t ≤β, (6) where fi (x), i = 1.2, g2 (t), h1 (t ) - specified functions, x0 - a given point from the interval (0, l), d+ = d ∩ {t> 0}, d - = d ∩ {t <0}. Task 2. Find the functions u (x, t) and g2 (t) that satisfy the conditions (2), (4), (5) and g2 (t) ∈C [−α, 0]; (7) u (x0, t) = h2 (t), 0 <x0 <l, - α≤ t ≤ 0, (8) where fi (x), i = 1.2, g1 (t), h2 ( t) - known functions. Task 3. Find the functions u (x, t), g1 (t), g2 (t) that satisfy the conditions (2) - (8), here fi (x), hi (t), i = 1.2 - specified functions. Note that the study of tasks 1 - 3 is based on a direct initial boundary task (2), (4) - (5) studied in [1]. In [2, 3], for degenerating 334 materials of the International School-Conference of Parabol-Hyperbolic equations, the reverse tasks of finding the functions u (x, t) and fi (x) were studied, when gi (t) ≡ 1. set tasks for the equation ( 1) with n = 0 studied in [4, p. 228–238]. In this work, the corresponding theorems of the uniqueness and existence of solutions to tasks 1-3 for equation (1) at N> 0. Literature 1. Sabitov K. B., Sidorov S. N.
