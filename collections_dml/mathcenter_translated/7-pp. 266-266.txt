. The nonequilibrium effects and identification methods for determining the relaxation characteristics of the Nonyuton oils E.B. Abutaliev, S.M. Mamakamov, U.Kh. Torsunov Tashkent Building Institute (Republic of Uzbekistan) Among the research of the relaxation characteristics of Novo oils, identification methods are of interest. REO logical and relaxation parameters included in differential equations describing hydrodynamic processes can be oscillates with a change in the input or output signals. The report discusses identification methods for determining the relaxation characteristics of oil using non -stationary models. Methods of theory of automatic control systems on the basis of the differential equations of the process, input and output data, the temporary characteristics of the system. The processes of the tixotropic once vulving structure in paraffin oils are long, and the relaxation time may be insufficient, then the spectrum of relaxation is used. Real fluids only have a linear viscosity only for the relatively small values ​​of the shift gradients, therefore, the results are evaluated. The rheological parameters determined by the methods of creep theory allow us to find not only the maximum possible pressure in oil waters, but also the time of the system to enter the stationary regime. These methods are developed to determine normal stresses and elastic characteristics of the hydrodynamics of Nonnyuton oils. 266
