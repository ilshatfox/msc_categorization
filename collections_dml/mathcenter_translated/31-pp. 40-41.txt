. The calculation of the concentrations of aerosol particles during the flow of the cylinder and the sphere of A.K. Gilfanov Kazan State University Solving the problems of obstacles of various forms of the aerosol stream is mainly reduced to calculating the seizure coefficient of particles settling on the obstacle. At the same time, the presence of the streamlined body in the flow of aerosol particles also leads to a change in their concentrations in the surroundings and on the surface of the body. Knowledge of the distribution of particles concentration expands the understanding of the process of the agricultural surveillance. In the work, the fields of the concentrations of aerosol particles are calculated at the flow of the cylinder and the sphere, taking into account the influence of strength of 40 severity. The equations of movement of the aerosol particle are presented in a dimensionless form dv̄ dt = ū - v̄ st + v̄s st, dr̄ dt = v̄, (1) where v̄ and ū ū - the speed of the particle and the bearing environment, v̄s is the speed of stationary sedimentation of the particle, ST is the number of Stakes. The speed of the supporting environment for the task of flowing the cylinder and the sphere in the approach of the two -dimensional potential course of the inconspicuous fluid is described in analytical formulas. To determine the concentrations of particles along the trajectory, a method proposed in [1] is used. Considering the coordinates of the particles with the function of the initial coordinates of the particle, consider Jacobian: j (x0, y0, t) = ∂x ∂x0 ∂y0 - ∂x ∂y0 ∂y ∂x0 = j11 j22 - J12 J21, (2) where x = where x = where x = where x = x (x0, y0, t), y = y (x0, y0, t), (x0, y0) - the initial decartes of the particle coordinates, t - time. The condition for the constancy of the particle flow within the particle tube dedicated in the space can be expressed in the form of [2] | J (x0, y0, t) | CP (x0, y0, t) = | j (x0, y0, 0) | CP (x0, y0, 0) = const, (3) where CP is the density or concentration of particles (the number of particles per unit volume of gas). We introduce additional variables W11, W12, W21, W22 to indicate the speed of changing the components J11, J12, J21, J22 J22 J22: W11 = ∂J11 ∂T, W12 = ∂J12 ∂T, W21 = ∂J21 ∂T, W22 = ∂AJ22 ∂ t, (4) 41
