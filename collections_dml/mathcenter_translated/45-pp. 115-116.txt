Transformations of equivalence for the equations of the movement of the two -dimensional layer of fluid omit the equations of the movement of the dnemo layer of the ideal fluid to the relative function, describe; the thickness of the layer of the y1 technology with the free boundary. The equations for the coordinates are squeaks in the Cartesian system so that the z axis is orthonal to the substrate, the axis X is directed towards the act of rolling power. Liquid: occupies the region! 1 = {(: z: z): -OO <x < +oo, o <z <h (x, t)}, 1 · ds t - time, n - the thickness of the liquid layer. The equations of the movement of the liquid of the style includes the computers of the speed vector (and, W) and the pressure P (rolling forces by replacing the NSRSMS can be included in 116 D. L. KPLCLORL Pressure). The liquid layer has a solid noddal 11ri Z = O and the free border at Z = H (x, T). New coordinates are introduced that fix the boundaries of the region 0 <f, <1: f = t, x = x, 1; = Zn- 1 (h:, y, f) and modifies ceremonious components of the speed vector U = nn, w = w - uf.hr, p = p ch.
