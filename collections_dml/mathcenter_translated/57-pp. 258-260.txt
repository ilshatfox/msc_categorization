Materials of the School-Conference of UDC 517.544 Solution of the problem of R-linear conjugation for the 3-phase correct hexagonal chess field Yu.V. Obnosov1 1 Yobnosov@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the work gives a closed solution to the problem of conjugating power fields in a three -phase flat bicoperiodic hexagonal heterogeneous environment. The case is considered when the field is generated by three endless sets of vortex-sources/drains, the same in each homogeneous phase. The necessary and sufficient condition for solvability of the task, connecting the power of sources/scenes and the intensity of vortices in heterogeneous phases, has been obtained. Using the obtained decision, a picture of the field (current and equitospocial line) for a number of sets of conductors of various phases and fixed capacities and intensities of vortex-sources/scenes was restored. The limiting cases of degeneration of a three -phase environment into two -phase and homogeneous are considered. Keywords: two -peridic heterogeneous environment, comprehensive analysis, a piece-matomorphic solution, conformal display. For the correct hexagonal three-phase chess field (see Fig. 1), the task of constructing a piece-matomorphic in the plane of folution Fig. 1. V (Z) with all hexagons fixed in OK centers with simple poles (the same in each of the three phases ωk, k = 1.2.3), i.e. The reso j v j (z) = Q j - ive j 2π, j = 1.2.3 are set. On the joint lines of the heterogeneous phases, ordinary conjugation conditions are performed: the continuity of normal and the proportionality of the tangent components V (Z) (the proportionality coefficient is equal to the ratio of the resistance coefficients ρk of the corresponding neighboring phases). First, using the corresponding conformal display ζ (Z), it is shown that the task is to lead to the regional task of the R-linear interpretation on the closed three-leaf riman surface Rζ function (1-ζ3) 1/3. At the same time, the bearers of the regional conditions are rays that go out of Yu.V. Obsots 259 from the beginning of the coordinates at the angles of ± π/3 and π. Then, by conducting a new auxiliary function, it is possible to obtain an equivalent flat task of Rlineal conjugation for three equal sectors. The fact of the coincidence of the last task with previously solved in the work [1] was remarkable. This made it possible to obtain in explicitly the only solution to the task when fulfilling the necessary and sufficient conditions Q1 +Q2 +Q3 = 0, ρ1 +ρ2γ2 +ρ3γ3 = 0. The limiting cases of the degeneration of the three -phase and uniform, as well as the case when one of the phases is studied when one of the phases It becomes non -conductive. Numerous examples of the distribution of current lines and equitospocialists for fixed values ​​of the resistances ρk, QK capacities and γk intensities are considered. One of these examples is given below (the general picture of the field is given on top, and lower in each separate phase). -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0.5 1.0 -1.0 -0 -0.5 0.0.5 1.0 -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -2.0 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 -0.5 0.0 -2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Fig. 2. ρ1 = 1, ρ2 = 10, ρ3 = 0.1, q1 = 1, Q2 = −1, γ1 = 0, γ2 = 0 This WAS SUPPORTED BY THE SUBSIDY TO KazAN FEDERAL UNIVERSITY FOR ASSIGNTI Scientific Activities, Project No. 1.13556.2019/13.1.

The Case When The Field is Generated by Three 260 Materials of the Infinite Sets of Vortex/Sources/Sinks that Identical in Each Homogeneus PHASES Considered. A Necessary and Sufficient Condition for the Solvability of the Problem is obtained, Which Relates the Power of Sources/Sinks and the Intensity of Vortices in Dissimilar Phasses. Using the obtained solution, the flow networks (streamlines and equipotentials) for a number of sets of conductivities of different phases and fixed powers of the sources/sinks and intensities of the vortexes was reconstructed. The Limiting Cases of the Degeneracy of a Three-Phase Medium Into Two-Phase and Homogeneous are Consedered.
