Hausdorf distance H (F, G) between the functions F and G, belonging to the class M, calls the distance of the Hausdorf-Minkskoro between their doped graphs F (F) and F (G): H (F, G): = h (f (f), f (g)). Through N EP (F), we denote the smallest evasion of the function F of m from trigonometric polynomas of the order no higher than the Hausdorf-Minkovsky. Through P (F), we denote the oscillation 54 functions F of m: pf) = sup {f (x): x e r} - Inf {j (x): x e jr}. Theorem 1.
