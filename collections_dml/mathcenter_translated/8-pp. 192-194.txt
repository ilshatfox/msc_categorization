Continuation for the Sobolev functions set in Heisenberg groups we identify the Geisenberghn group with spacer2n+1. The metric of Heisenberg is as follows: ρ (p, q) = | p - 1 · q |, where | p | = ((x21 +.. + x22n) 2 + x22n + 1) 1/4 for point p = (x1,., 192 x2n + 1). Levarian vector fields = ∂∂xj+2xj+n ∂x2n+1, j = 1 ,. . . , n, xj = ∂∂xj - 2xj - n ∂x2n + 1, j = n + 1 ,. . . , 2n, x2n+1 = ∂x2n+1 form the base of the algebra Lee corresponding to the HN group. Haara’s binariant measure in GroupHN coincides with the measure of the Lebag in the space R2N+1. Let ⊂ Hn - some area. For the function f ∈ C of (D), we believe ‖f‖ kp (d) = (∫ d | f (x) | pdx+ ∫ d [2n∑ i1, ..., IK = 1 (XI1., XIKF ( x)) 2] p/2 dx) 1/p. Sobolev KP (D) space is defined as a replenishment of the set {onic ∈ C of (D) | ‖ Vents kp (d) <mm} according to the norm ‖ç‖w kp (d). Theorem. Suppose that the area d ⊂ HN is limited and belongs to the C2 class. Then, for any 1 ≤ k, 1 <p <φ, there is a linear limited operator E: w kp (d) 7 → W kp (h n), which satisfies the ratio EF (x) = f (x) for almost all x ∈ D. Horizontal polynomas of the degree no higher than l will call the functions in which all horizontal derivatives (i.e., derivatives along the vector fields XI, I = 1,., 2N) of the L + 1 order are identically equal to zero. Proof of the theorem significantly uses the generalized inequality of Poincare: ‖f - pf‖lp (b) ≤ c (k) rk∇klf‖lp (b), where PF is horizontal Polin degree (k -1), b - geisenbergs ball Radius r, ∇klf is a tensor, the components of which are all horizontal derivatives of the order K functions F, 1 <p <mm, proven by the author in [1], and the method of continuing P.

Suppose that the q operator has a finalized nucleus. Put ‖f‖wq, p (d) = ‖f‖lp (d) + ‖qf‖lp (d). The space WQ, P is defined as a replenishment of the set {F ∈ CU (D) | ‖F‖wq, p (d) <urb} according to the norm ‖f‖wq, p (d). This theorem is generalized in case of WQ, P (D) spaces. A number of investment theorems are displayed from the formulated statements. L and T R A T R A 1. Romanovsky N. N.
