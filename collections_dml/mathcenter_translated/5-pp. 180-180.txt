Tensor works of operas and thorce in the winch spaces are investigated the issue associated with the calculation of the norms of the strains of operators acting between the functional spaces of Leber: is it true that if we have two operators a: lp (µ) -+ lq (v ) and in: lp (µ) -t u (v), then the norm of their tensor work a 0 in: lp (µ μ µ) -+ lh (v g v) sleeps with the work \\ a \ 11 \ in \\ in \\ in \\ their norms? Theorem. The answer to the above question of Polithemn in that and only in that “tea is that 1 ~ p ~ q ~ oo. This result is the answer to the question posed by the author Ya.Yu. Nikitin at the end of May 2000” and is related to some Red hypotheses in probability theory. The positive part of the statement of the theorem can be established using the abstract technique of the theory of tensile works in normalized spaces, but it also has elementary evidence, using only some standard facts of the classical theory of the Lebble integral. As for the negative part of our result - “countertromers” - - for their receipt, we use no assessments from the theory of the endless R -sum -thoroughs in normalized spaces. 180
