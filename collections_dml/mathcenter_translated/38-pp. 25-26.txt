The asymmetric approaches of the classes of periodic functions with flaws of the defect 2 and the inequalities of the Jackson 25 Let LP, 1 ~ p ~ cxj,-spaces of 27g-periodic functions F: jr ---> jr with the corresponding norms 11 · l \ lp = 1 \ · 1 · 1 \ 1 · 1 \ P, CR (T = O, 1,. ..) - space T times continuously differently differently differently (continuous at R · = O) 27R -periodic function. If F E LP and A, {Z. - Positive numbers, then put LLF! LP; a,/j = llaf + + f3f -l/1 "where j ± (t) = scax {± f (t), o}. Let MS LP - some class of functions. The value of E (m, h) p; a, f: j = sup h ~ l l/f - hllp; a,/j fem is called the best (a, 13) - intelligence of the class m in the metric of lp. L ~, t = 1, 2, ..., 1 ~ p ~ cxj, we denote the set of 27r-periodic functions, in which J (r-l) (! (O): = f) is completely continuous, and j. (r) e lp; through W; - a class of functions F e l; in which llfllv ~ 1. For natural n and t through s ~ n, m, we will indicate about the wandering of 27r -periodic polynomial alleys on a row of the defect 2 s. Unders at points 2J7R /P, J E. 26 V.F. Babenko, N.V. Parfinovich Let <{) P, t (a, (h; t) (a, {3> o, l> o, l> o, m e n) there is a 27g /I-periodic integral of the TP order with a zero average value in the period from the even 27g /p-periodic function <{) n, o (a, /3; t), which for t e [o, 7g /n) it is determined with _ '! Out of the way: {a, <{) p, o (a, /3; t ) = -/3, we have proven the following theorem. Empty p, r, t e n, t ~ r, a, /3> O. Then E (wt s2) _ e (<p1, r (a "b; ·) oo 1 '2n, m l; a, , 6 - PT 'where E (<p1, "(a, /3; -)) 00 - the nailo uniform approximately: the function of the function <p ~, t (a, /3; ·) constant subspace. From the theorem at a = /3 = 1, we get the best, and with max {a, 6} = oo, min {a, /3} = 1 - the best unilateral approximations of the class W [Sin, m in the wanderings L 1. In addition, with the help of this theorem and certain results of A. A. Ligun, we establish new accurate inequalities such as Jackson for the best and best nesting L1 -attachments of functions from LJ. and STs for the wanderers s ~ n, m.
