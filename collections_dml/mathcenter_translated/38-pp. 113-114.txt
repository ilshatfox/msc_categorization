The criterion for solving the problem 113 on the aspericity of the convex compact to the task of the asperchpro of the convex compact D of; RP, with a non -resistant inside, is called _ R (x). 'P (x) = - () ~ rn1n, p x xed (1) where the functions r (x) = max p (x - y), p (x) = min p (x - y) yed UEP express respectively From point x to the very minimum. . Lennaya point of the set of D and the closest of the set n = ffilp \ d in the given norm P (x). The function R (x) is convex on FFILP, and the function P (x) is concave on D, the corresponding formulas of the subdiffsrenzial dr (x) and super differential dr (x) (see [1] and [2]) are known. The indicator of the aspericity of RP* = min {rp (x): x e d} is used (usually for the case of Euclidean Norma) when characterizing the properties of a convex body and constructing its methods when close. However, the authors do not know the results of the study of the task (1) received earlier. Theorem. 1) Fuiksi. I 'r (x). Iv. I am a quasi ~ pukla and subdiff reicidated, in S.M. L. .
