UDC 517.54 Bomasturi hypothesis for conformal display of the circle of D.V. Prokhorov1 1 prochorovdv@info.sgu.ru; Saratov State University, Petrozavodsk State University of Bomelry Tryri Trymn characterize the factors of coefficients for class S of all holomorphic and single -legged in a single circle of functions F, normalized by decay F (Z) = Z + A2Z2 +. . . . The number σmn is calculated as the limit of the ratio of re (n −an) and re (m -am) at F, striving for the function of kebek (z) = z (1 --z) −2. In particular, σ23 = 0. We determine the similar numbers σmn (m) for class S (m) ⊂ S limited functions | f (z) | <M, | z | <1, M> 1, with the limit of the ratio re (pn (m) −an) and re (pm (m) −am) at F, striving for the pic (z) = mk −1 (k (z)/ ki function. M) = z + ∑ happen n = 2 pn (m) z n. We prove that σ23 (m) = −4/m, m> 1. This is a joint work with V. G. Gordienko. Keywords: single -leaf function, bomasturi number, kebe function, peak function. Let s denoter the class of all holomorphic and single -leafy in a single circle d = {z: | z | <1} Functions f (z) = z + ger∑ n = 2 an z n. During the long history of the theory of single -leafful functions, the famous function of keb K (z) = z (1- z) 2 = ger∑ n = 1 nzn ∈ S turned out to be extreme in many tasks on the class S. E. Bomburi [2] proved the local hypothesis of Bieberbach About evaluation | An | ≤ n, n ≥ 2, in class S and in the same article set the task of finding numbers now called the bomber, σmn: = liminf am → m n −re an m −re am = liminf s∋ f mm n --re ana M −re am, m, n ≥ 2, (1) where F strives to K Locally evenly inside D. Having performed the so -called material variations in the vicinity of the Keb function, Bomburi put forward the hypothesis that σmn = bmn, where BMN: = min θives [0.2π] n sinθ - sin (nθ) m sinθ - sin (mθ), and proved that σmn ≤ BMN for m = 3 and odd N, see also results in [4] and [5]. BSHUTI and HENAGTER [5] proved the bomasturi hypothesis in the class of SR functions F ∈ S C D.V. Prokhorov 301 material coefficients of his Taylor decomposition. Since according to the local hypothesis of Bieberbach, proven bomasturi in [2], and the proof of de Branzha [3] of the global hypothesis of the bieberbach, BMN ≥ 0 and σmn ≥ 0, and from the results [5] it follows that σmn = 0, provided that BMN = 0. Indeed, in this case, σmn = liminf s∋ f → k n −re an m −re am ≤ liminf sr∋ f → k n −re an m --re am = bmn = 0. In particular, σ23 = b23 = b23 = b23 = b23 = b23 = b23 = b23 = b23 = b23 = b23 = b23 0, which can be installed directly. The bomasturi hypothesis in the entire class S was refuted by the grainer and company in [8] for n = 2 and m = 3. They showed that σ32 = E −1 4e <1 4 = b32. In continuation of this result, it was shown in [10] that σ42 = 0.050057 ... <b42 = 0.1, σ24 = 0.969556 ... <b24 = 1, σ34 = 0.791557 ... <b34 = 0.828427 .... Finding the bomber σmn numbers is reduced to the assessment of linear functionals on the class S, see, for example, [8] and [10]. Namely, σmn = sup {λ ∈R}, where the upper face is taken according to many numbers λ, for which the local maximum functionality of Re (AN - ANAM) in class S is delivered by the function of KEB K (Z). Recently, a series of works appeared, see [1], [6], [7], indicating the return of interest in the bomberry hypothesis. Unlike Bomeliri, Lyung produced the so -called complex variation in the vicinity of Kebe function and received variation formulas, on the basis of which Efraimidis prescribed a whole many paired indices {mn} such that σmn <bmn. In the work [10] of the bomasturi numbers, they were calculated by the method of optimal management, which theoretically allowing you to find any number of bomasturi. However, with the growth of indexes, M and N, the volume of calculations increased so rapidly that it became unrealistic to bring them to the end. On the other hand, Lyung received variation formulas that provided relatively simple sufficient conditions for fixing in some cases violation of the validity of the bomberry hypothesis. Aaronov and BSHUTI in [1] develop the ideas of Bomburi [2] that even and odd coefficients have various asymptotica at | A2 | → 2, which is reflected in the equality of bomasturi Liminf A2 → 2 3 --re A3 (2 --re A3) 3 = 8 3. Aarons and BSHUTs proved that for the functions F ∈ S and for any M ∈N, the inequality 2M - | A2M | 2 - | a2 | ≥ 3m 2 (4m2 −1), 2m +1 - | a2m +1 | √ (2- | a2 |) 3 ≥ P 2 4 15m (M +1) (4m2 −1) (2m +3). 302 Materials of the International School-Conference. The calculation of bomasturi numbers is interesting, among other things, because they characterize the structure of the border of the body of the coefficients Vn: = {(A2,., AN): F ∈ S}, N ≥ 2, for class S B. The surroundings of the point KN: = (2,., n) ∈Vn delivered by the function of the kebble. The point KN is the angular point of the set VN in the sense that there is a family of supporting hyperprafs on the multitude of VN, passing
