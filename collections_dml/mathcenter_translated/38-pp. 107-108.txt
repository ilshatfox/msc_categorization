Let N (C) - about the wanderings of whole functions with the compact topology are condensed. 108 A. M. Dilmukhametova, A. U. Mullabaeva, V.V. Napalkov, by definition, the space of FOK F ~ {F e n (c) • 11/11 2 ~; [l/(z) l'E -! 'J' dµ}, where µ is Lebegova measure. It is known that space F has the following properties (see, for example, [2]): 1) the transformation of Laplace transfers ej1 to F to f; 2) Contacted to the operator of the variable Z is the differentiation operator. These properties underlie the practical application of FOK space. We introduce a generalization of the FOK Foca space in a single case: F13 = {1en (C): 11111 2 = 1 1 L) 1 LL (Z) I2E-! ZL11Dµ}. 1g ft g (in · C. In this work, an operator was found, associated with the RU multiplying operator to a variable Z, and the own function of the conjugated operator in the introduced space was determined and the generalized transformation of JLAPASA was studied.
