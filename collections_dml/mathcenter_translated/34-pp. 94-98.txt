. Building a solution to the Gurs problem for the equation of Liuville V. I. Zhegalov, A. A. Kungurtsev, let D = {0 <x <a, 0 <y <b}. Task (Gursa): Find the function u (x, y) ∈ C (D) ⋂ c1.1 (D), which is in D by the solution of the equation Uxy = k exp u, k = const, (1) and satisfying the boundary conditions of U ( X, 0) = µ (x), x ∈ [0, A], U (0, Y) = ν (y), y ∈ [0, b], µ (0) = ν (0). (2) It is known [1, p. 321] The general representation of the decision (1), first half -obtained by Liwill: Exp U = 2 k ′ (x) ψ ′ (y) [onic (x) + ψ (y)] 2. (3) When constructing formula (3), the functions of ln accord (x), lnψ ′ (y), ln (2/k) are used. Therefore, it should be assumed that K> 0, ∗ ′ (x)> 0, ψ ′ (y)> 0. (4) 96 in the rest Сory, ψ are arbitrary functions. Put µ (0) = ν (0) = 0, (5) for this can always be achieved by substituting u = u0 +w (x, y), u0 = µ (0) = ν (0). (6) Obviously, W satisfies the equation (1) with the multiplier KEU0 instead of K. And yet, taking into account the structure of the right part (3) and the pleasantness ∗, ψ, we put onic (x) = ∗1 (x) - ∈ (0) + 1, ψ (y) = ψ1 (y) - ψ1 + + 1. Therefore, we can (and we will) assume that wor (0) = ψ (0) = 1. (7) now we will look for a solution to the problem. By substituting (3) B (2), I have EXP µ (x) = 2 k onic (x) ψ ′ (0) [1 + onic (x)] 2, expp ν (y) = 2 k ∗ ′ ( 0) ψ ′ (y) [1 + ψ (y)] 2. (8) Having integrated the first of these differential equalities, we find ffic (x) = ψ ′ (0) + K x∫ 0 Exp µ (₽) dă ′ (0) - K x∫ 0 Exp µ (₽) dran. (9) by force (5), (7) from (3) follows ∗ ′ (0) ψ ′ (0) = 2K. Therefore (9), taking into account (4) rewrite: onic (x) = 2 + onic (0) x∫ 0 explode µ (ă) daw 2 - ′ (0) x∫ 0 exp µ (₽) dival. (10) 97 Consciously calculate ′ ′ (x) = 4 accord (0) Exp µ (x) {2 - ∈ (0) X∫ 0 Exp µ (₽) daw} 2. (11) Having put X = 0, we have a ratio ′ ′ (0) = ∗ ′ (0), which you are filled with any value onic ′ (0). Thus, ∗ ′ (0) is not determined from (11). So far, we will still consider ′ ′ (0) an uncertain positive (see (4)) Constant C, A (10) COMMENTION LIVE: ivil (x) = 2 + C X∫ 0 Exp µ (Answers) dran 2 - C X∫ 0 Exp µ (₽) dran, x ∈ [0, a]. (12) It is clear that the denominator should not contact zero. It is indicated through f (x), we see that it is a function that decreases on [0, a] (i.e. to. F ′ (x) = —c Exp µ (x)). The condition of the circulation f (x) in zero is C X∫ 0 Exp µ (Answers) dă = 2. Therefore, to a status condition for the unreason f (x) in zero on [0, a] is the execution of inequality c <2 a∫ 0 Exp µ (cil) dival. (13) Similarly, having solved the second equation (8) relatively ψ (y), we get ψ (y) = 2 + c1 y∫ 0 Exp ν (η) dη 2 - c1 y∫ 0 Exp ν (η) dη, y ∈ [0, b], (14) with a positive constant C1, satisfying the condition C1 <2 b∫ 0 Exp ν (η) dη. (15) 98 is not difficult to see (see (11) and a similar formula for ψ ′ (y)) that requirements (4) are fulfilled. By substituting (12), (14) B (3), after obvious transformations we find Exp U (X, Y) = 8CC1 Exp [µ (X) + ν (Y)] K {4 - CC1 X∫ 0 Exp µ (₽ ) Ddition y∫ 0 Exp ν (η) dη} 2. (16) Having put here x = 0, y = 0, we have cc1 = 2k. By force (13), (15), the boundary conditions (2) must satisfy the inequality K A∫ 0 Exp µ (ă) daw b∫ 0 Exp ν (η) dη <2, (17) a formula (16) at cc1 = 2k Obviously, it acquires the type of Exp U (X, Y) = 4 Exp [µ (x) + ν (y)] {2 - k x∫ 0 explode µ (ă) daw y∫ 0 explinatory ν (η) dη 2. (18) This is the desired solution of the problem. From the above reason, the unity of this decision follows. Thus, to the cauldron of the theorem. If on the segments of your definition µ (x), ν (y) ∈ ∈ C and the condition (17) is fulfilled, then the solution of the problem 1 is only given by the formula (18). Note that for a more general equation Uxy = F (X, Y, U, UX, UY), the correctness of the Gurs problem is proved by the method of sequential approaches [2, p. 205]. 99 L and T R A T R A 1.
