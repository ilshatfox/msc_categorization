The stability of a nonequilibrium cosmological scenario in relation to the initial distribution parameters in the work [1, 2] built a model of cosmological evolution of super -thicker particles in the conditions of squaling of interactions. At the same time, as a section of the interaction of elementary particles in the area of ​​high energies, an asymptotic scattering cross section was used, introduced into [3]: σ0 (s) = 2π S (1 + ln2 s s0) = 2π sλ (s), (1) 57 where S is a kinematic invariant of a four -partial reaction, S0 = 4 - a square of complete energy of the two colliding plank masses, λ (S) = 1 + LN2 S S0 ≈ COST. (2) In [4], the relaxation of the super -weapon components of the cosmological plasma on the equilibrium component in the assumption was investigated that the number of particles in the super -thicker component is much less than the equilibrium of the particles. In particular, it was shown that the solution of the kinetic equation describing the evolution of the ultra -altratic superfluoric component in equilibrium cosmological plasma has the form ∆fa (t, p) = ∆f0a (p) exp   ξaw (t, p) p t∫ 0 y2 (t ′) dtft √ t ′  , (3) where ∆f0a (p) = ∆fa (0, p) is the initial deviation from equilibrium, and dimensionless functions are introduced: y (t)/ t (t)/ t (t) T0 (t); σ ≡ y4; σ0 ≡ y4 (0), where t (t) is the temperature of the equilibrium component of the plasma, t0 (t) - the temperature at the same time of time in a completely equilibrium universe. Dying impulse variable p is a conformal impulse. For the rest of the details, see the article [4]. The relative temperature y (t) of the equilibrium component of the plasma, which is the parameter of the nonequilibrium distribution (3), is determined from the integral equation of the energy balance Y4 + 15 π4 ∑ a ga φ∫ 0 p3∆f0a (p) × × exp ---ran (t, p ) P t∫ 0 y2 (t ′) dtft ′   dp = 1. (4) 58 The results present the results of numerical integration of equation (4) for various initial distributions of particles and graphics, demonstrating the impact of the initial distribution parameters on the process Relaxation of the temperature of the plasma, as well as the results of the numerical modeling of the process of heating the equilibrium component with super -thicker particles for the initial step and exponential distributions based on equation (4), depending on the initial distribution parameters. As a result, it was shown [4] that the cosmological evolution of nonequilibrium plasma is significantly determined only by two integral parameters - the degree of nonequilibrium σ0 and the initial conformal energy of the particles P.L.
