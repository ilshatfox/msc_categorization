Models permitted in the permissible sets for an arbitrary permissible set of A consider the concepts of permitted (limitedly permitted, calculated) in the algebraic system. It is shown that if the M 1-percussion system in HF (M), then in HF (M) there is a universal σ-function and fair principle of reduction, but the principle of uniformization is not always carried out. There is a theorem 1. Let M 1-percussion in HF (M). Then HF (M) has the property of uniforms in that case, when some existential cheekbone enrichment of the M system M is calculated in HF (M). A description of the permitted models permitted in the HF and supervisors, generalizing the Nurtazin theorem [1]. Theorem 2. For the computable system m and n ≤ ω, the following conditions are equivalent: 1) m n-percussion in HF (M); 2) for any n 'm n n-percussion relative to D (n); 69 3) for any computable n 'm n n-calculated.

Gareeva (Kazan, lgareeva@yandex.ru) about the operational analogues of some cellular rings we consider the matrix linear surgery m = m (x, k) above the field K [1] and the right action of group G on a set of X. According to this action, you can build homomorphism OKD A: KG → M, such that A (G1,., GM) (X1... y. . . Δxmgm, y (kg (m) = k [g m]; this operating is studied in [1]). We denote through HX, G (M) the many of all such C S (M) that A (G). . . A (g) c = ca (g) for any g ∈ G. Then hx, g = {hg, x (m) | m = 1, 2 ,. . .} There is a suboperda m. This design is an operational generalization of the algebra of the adjacency (cell rings) of the relations of relations considered in [2], p. 4 ) G (m) | M = 1, 2,. . .}, where (kx) g (m) = {w ∈ K [xm] | wg = w for all g ∈ G}. In particular, albeit g = σn (a group of substances of the nth degree), x-a free switching half-group with the basis X1 ,. . . , XN, and the action G on X is such that XIσ = xσ (I). Then kx (m) ∼ = k [x1.1 ,. . . , x1, n,. . . , XM, 1,. . . , xm, n], and (kx) σn = λn, m - a ring of multisimetric functions [3]. Consider in kx (m) ideal I (m), generated by all differences ∏ i, j x ki, j - ∏ i, j x si, j, j, somewhere ki, j = si, j, or ki, j ≡ Si, J (Mod 2). Then I = {I (M) | M = 1, 2,. . .} There is the ideal of the KX operates, and the σn group acts on (kx/i) (m). We denote through λ (2) n, m under the ring of the ring (kx/i) (m), consisting of elements that are motionless relative to the action σn. Then λ (2) n = {λ (2) n, m | m = 1, 2 ,. . .} Ope 70
