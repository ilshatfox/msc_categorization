) The convergence of close solutions of the weak -rampular integral equations of the first kind in the space of the summarized functions in connection with numerous applications in the tasks of the mechanics and mathematical physics of the weak -and -sulfur integral equation of the type AX ≡ 1 2π 2π∫ 0 ln sin ∣∣∣∣ σ - s 2 ∣∣∣∣ x (σ) dσ + + 1 2π 2π∫ 0 h (s, σ) x (σ) dσ = y (s), 0 ≤ s ≤ 2π, (1) The task arose to theoretically substantiate close methods of its solution with minimal assumptions regarding the initial data y (s) and h (s, σ). To solve this problem, following [1], we use the approach based on finding the conditions of its correct setting. If, as the spaces of the desired elements and right parts, take the spaces of the summarized functions of L1 and the functions that have the first derivatives of L1, then the condition of stability will be violated in the problem under consideration. In this regard, a couple of spaces are proposed that are some narrowings of the space of the summarized functions in which the task of solving equation (1) is correctly set. Let w = w [0, 2π] - the space of 2π -periodic summarized functions, for which the singular integral with the nucleus of 176 of the Hilbert JX ≡ J (x; s) = 1 2π 2π∫ 0 x (σ) ctg σ - s 2 dσ, Understanded in the sense of the main value of Koshi, is also a summarized function, and with the norm ‖x‖w = ‖x‖l1 + ‖jx‖l1, where l1 = l1 [0, 2π] is the space of the summarized 2π-periodic functions with the usual norm . Through W 1 = W 1 [0, 2π], we denote the space of the summarized functions that have the first derivatives from W [0, 2π]. Let us introduce the norm in the following ratio: ‖X‖W 1 = ‖X‖L1 + ‖X‖W. Theorem 1. The weak -raised operator sx = 1 2π 2π∫ 0 ln ∣∣∣∣sin σ - s 2 ∣∣∣∣ x (σ) dσ, s: w → w 1, continuously turn and ‖s -1‖w 1 → W ≤ 2. Theorem 2. Let the nucleus h (s, σ) such that the operator r: w → w 1 is quite continuous. If a homogeneous equation corresponding to the equation (1) has only a zero solution, then the operator A: W → W 1 is continuously turn. Let the PN - either the Fourier operator, which in accordance with each function x ∈ L1 N -n -e, its line of the Fourier according to the trigonometric system, or the Operator of the Plains [2], which sets each function x ∈ L1 Polin qn (s) of degree N, satisfying the conditions of SK +1∫ SK TN (S) DS = SK +1∫ SK X (S) DS, SK = 2Kπ 2N +1, K = 0, 2N. 177 Lemma 1. For any function x ∈ W [0, 2π] Assessment ‖pnx‖w = o (ln n) ‖x‖l1 is true. We denote through W RHα1 = W RHα1 [0, 2π] the space of 2π-periodic functions, which have derivatives to the R-G-G-GO, satisfying the condition of the Helder with the indicator α in the space L1. Lemma 2. If x ∈ W RHα1, then the following assessment is valid ‖x - pnx‖w = o (ln n nr+α). The obtained estimates made it possible to theoretically substantiate the methods of Galerkin and the Plains and to get the convergence of close decisions to the accusable L1 space metric.
