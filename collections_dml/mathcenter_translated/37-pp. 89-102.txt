Complex structures for one indecent nilpotent group of Lee in this work are considered almost complex structures J, associated with levoinariat symptical structures ω, determined in the non -stitent six -dimensional groups of Lee. Such structures are interesting in that each of them can be associated (pseudo) Rimanov metric G, which allows the use of riman geometry methods to study them. In [1], the classification of left -indicative nilpotent groups of Lee is given. It contains 25 groups. In [2], levoinariat integrated structures for indecent nilpotent groups of Lee and their explicit species are calculated. Consider one of the groups of Lee included in the intersection of lists from these works, find associated complex structures and calculate the scalar curvature and the Ricci tensor of associated metrics. Consider a group of Lee [1], whether the algebra is in the basis {E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6} has structural constants C512 = 1, C 6 13 = 1, C 6 24 = 1, C 5 34 = −1 . Note that this algebra Lee has a two -dimensional center Z, formed by E5, E6 vectors. The general element of the X algebra can be represented by a matrix X of order 6, the first four lines of which have the form (0, X3, 0, - X6, 0, - X5), (0, 0, 0, X1, X5, X6), ( 0, 0, 0, X2, 0, X6), 90 (0, 0, 0, 0, X2, X4), and the last two are zero. The general element of the corresponding group Lee G1 has the form G = ID + X, where ID is a single matrix. Left-means sympy structure is specified [1] 2-form ω = θ1 ∧ θ6-θ2 ∧ θ3 + θ4 ∧ θ5, where θi is 1-form, dual base {ei}. The almost comprehensive structure of the type J = (lection) is considered, where I, j = 1: 6. The condition of association with the sympy structure has the form ω (jx, jy) = ω (x, y). From this condition we get: j =  ξ ξ11 μ12 " ă24 ă54 –ran44 –M14 μ61 –ran31 μ31 μ51 –M41 –M11  . The almost comprehensive structure is integrated (complex) if its tensor Neyenheis n (x, y) = 2 ([jx, jy] - [x, y] - j [x, jy] - J [jx, y]) converts to Nyl. Equating the elements of the Neienheis tensor to zero and checking the condition J2 = −1, we get two different families of complex structures: J1 =   0 0 −1 0 - ₽222unk23 1+₽2 22 22 22 22 ξ22 mit23 - ξ31urb231+ξ2 22 0 0 ξ31 1+ă222 ξ23 –M22 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 μ51 0 - oring231+cil2 μ54 0 1 - ξ54 (1+ă 22) –ran23ă 1+ξ2 22 22 22 - edge31 - cil222acy31urb231+cil2 22 μ51 −1 0  , 91 j2 =   0 0 −1 0 ξ31urb23 0 ξ23 –ran31urb23 0 μ31 - 1ă23 0 ă 34 0 0 0 0 ξ51 –M51 —M34 μ31urb23 μ54 0 1 Answers 2 34 - mal - ξMA31 N34M23 N51 —1 0                                                                              .

Lobachevsky, korolev_s_a@mail.ru to study resonances in the system of two weakly tied pendulums, consider the system with two degrees of freedom, consisting of two weakly tied pendulum equations   ẍ + sin x = ε [(a + cos x) ẋ + + + + + + αẏ], ÿ + sin y = ε [(b + cos y) ẏ + βẋ], (1) 92 where ε is a small positive parameter, a, b, α, β - parameters. This system is close to nonlinear integrated. With ε = 0, the system (1) breaks up into two independent equations. The phase cylinder of each of the uninocated equations is divided into two areas: oscillatory, filled with closed phase curves that do not cover the cylinder, and rotational. In the oscillatory areas, new variables of action are introduced - angle (I1, I2, θ1, θ2). Varias of action I1, I2 determine the two -dimensional invariant Thor, θ1, θ2 - angular coordinates on it. The movement on the Torah is conditionally periodic with frequencies ω1 (i1), ω2 (i2). The following is the resonant case when the frequencies are commensurate, that is, the ratio of pω1 (i1) - qω2 (i2) = 0 is performed, where P, Q is natural numbers. The condition of commensuration determines the resonant curve on the plane of variable action. In the vicinity of the point of this curve, a three -dimensional average system is calculated. The functions in the right parts of the equations of this system are obtained in the form of rapidly converging rows. Leaving the main members in the rows, we get the system    v ′ = w + µ (p1u2 + p2uw + p3w2), w ′ = p4 + (αp5 + βp6) cos pv + + µ [(p7 + (αp8 + βp9) cos pv) u + + + (p10 + αp11 cos pv) w], u ′ = p12 + αp13 cos pv + + µ [(p14 + αp15 cos pv ) u + (αp16 cos pv) W], (2) where µ = √ ε, pi is the parameters, and P4, P7, P10, P12, P14 linearly depend on A and B. For the system (2), a study was conducted with 93 standing equilibrium. A numerical study of the system (2) was also carried out depending on the parameters α, β. The work was carried out with the support of the RFFI, project 06-0100270.
