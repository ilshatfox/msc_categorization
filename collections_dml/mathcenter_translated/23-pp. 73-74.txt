DIRECT LIMITS OF Hv-MODULES  In this paper, the category of Hv-modules is considered. Also, it is shown that the direct limit of every direct system always exist in this category. Direct limit are defined by a universal property, and so are unique. The most powerful tool in order to obtain a module from a given Hv-module is the quotient out procedure. By use this method, some results about the connection between the fundamental modules, direct systems and direct limits is proved by considering the fundamental equivalence relation ε∗.  B. Solon (Ivanovo, Russia, solon@icti.ivanovo.su)  QUASI-MINIMALITY IS A SYNONYM OF THE NON-TOTALITY OF ENUMERATION DEGREE  We use notations and terminology similar to those of the monograph [1]. We recall as [2] that A ≤e B (A is enumeration reducible to B), if there is a uniform algorithm for enumerating A given any enumeration of B. Formally,  A ≤e B ⇐⇒ (∃n)(∀x)[x ∈ A ⇐⇒ (∃u)[〈x, u〉 ∈ Wn ∧Du ⊆ B]].  Let as usual A ≡e B ⇐⇒ A ≤e B ∧ B ≤e A and de(A) = {B : B ≡e A} be e-degree of A and de(A) ≤ de(B) ⇐⇒ A ≤e B. Denote by De the set of e-degrees partially ordered by ≤ and by 0e the least element of De .  An e-degree a is called non-total if in it there are no total functions (which are identified with their graphs). Let Tot be the set of all total e-degrees. The first example of a non-total e-degree has given by Medvedev [3]. The Medvedev’s e-degrees were named by Case [4] quasi-minimal later: a is quasiminimal iff  0e < a ∧ (∀f ∈ Tot)[f ≤ a → f = 0e].  75    Sasso [5] generalizes this notion relatively an e-degree c < a: a is c-quasiminimal iff  c < a ∧ (∀f ∈ Tot)[f ≤ a → f ≤ c]. It is clear that any c-quasi-minimal e-degree is non-total, whether but  correctly the converse. It appears not correctly, as was shown in [6] there exist non-total e-degrees which are not c-quasi-minimal for any e-degree c. And still such non-total e-degrees somewhat also are ’quasi-minimal’. In [7] Slaman and Sorbi have introduced the notion of I- quasi-minimal e-degree where ∅ 6= I ⊆ De is a set of e-degrees: a is I-quasi-minimal iff  (∀c ∈ I)[c < a] ∧ (∀f ∈ Tot)[f ≤ a ⇐⇒ (∃c ∈ I)[f ≤ c]].  Theorem . Any non-total e-degree a is f-quasi-minimal for some f ∈ Tot or F-quasi-minimal for some family of the total e-degrees F = {fs} forming a growing sequence f0 < f1 < · · · < fs < · · · < a.
