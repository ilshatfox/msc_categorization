Materials of the School-Conference UDC 517.544.8 Properties of one operator J.E.r. Muangha1 1 gmouangou@yahoo.fr; North (Arctic) Federal University named after M.V. Lomonosov in the article discusses the integral equalities containing a semi -unit operator A in the material Hilbert space L2 (0, π), which are fundamental in the theory of reverse tasks for analytical functions. Keywords: a semi -unit operator, operator functions, the theory of reverse tasks for analytical functions. In the material Hilbert space L2 (0, π), we determine the linear operator A by the values ​​that it accepts on the basic vectors Cosnt, N = 0.1,. . .: A (cosnt) = sinnt. Operator A is a semi -unitary operator. At the same time, a a ∗ = e and a ∗ a = e −p, where E is a single operator, p is the design operator to the core K ER (A) = {1}, and a ∗ - an operator associated with the operator A. that for any natural numbers M and n are such that n ≥ m are fair of equality a (cosmt · cosnt) = cosmt · sinnt, a (sinmt · sinnt) = —sinmt · cosnt and equality resembling the formula of the muavra: (cos t - sin t · a) n = cosnt - sinnt · A. Let further α, β, γ, δ - valid numbers and | β | <α. Then the function γ+δcos t α+βcos t belongs to the space L2 (0, π) and A (γ+δcos t α+βcos t) = αδ --βγival α2 β2 · sin t α+βcos t. These formulas and many others are given and proved in [1]. Consider the function θ ∈ L2 (0, π) is such that CH Aθ ∈ L2 (0, π). Then a (cosθ · chθ) = —sinθ · shu aθ and a (sinθ · chθ) = cosθ · sh a axa. The report set the following equations π∫ 0 e a ∗ θ cos step t = π, π∫ 0 e a ∗ θ sinθ sin td td td t = π∫ 0 θ sin td t, 1 π π∫ 0 cosθch aθd t = cos  1 1 π π∫ 0 θd t    and 1 π π∫ 0 sinθch aθd t = sin  1 π π∫ 0 θd t  , J.E.r. Muangga 243 are fundamental in the theory of reverse tasks for analytical functions. These formulas are very useful and effective when calculating integrals. Так, например, если взять  θ = a +b p λ2 −1  λ+cos t ,  где a,b,λ вещественный числа и λ> 1, то получим, что  Aθ =− b sin t λ+cos t и  1  π  π ∫ 0 θd t = a +b. Therefore, the equality of 1 π π∫ 0 cos (a +b p λ2 − λ +cos t) ch (b sin t λ +cos t) d t = cos (a +b) is true, which cannot be installed by the powerful systems of analytical calculations - Maple and Mathematica.
