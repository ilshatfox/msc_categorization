The worst fractions of the week discuss the functions of the type Rn (z) = ∑n j = 1 1/(z - aj), where aj (poles of the function rn (z)) - some points of the complex plane C are not necessarily different. Obviously, Rn (Z) is a logarithmic derivative of a certain polynomial degree n. For point b ∈ C and functions f, analytical in some single -copper vicinity U Point B, following [1], put α (z) = α (f; z): = ∫ z b f (ζ) dζ, where integration is carried out according to any hidden The paths L (b, z) from this surroundings leading from b to z. With n ≥ 1, the most rational differential of order n-1 functions f (z) at point B, in some single-line vicinity U which f (z) is unambiguous and analytical, or the most common fraction of the N-th Order of the function f (z) at point B We call the smallest fraction of rn (f, b; z) the order ≤ n with the property: f (z) −rn (f, b; z) = o ((z - b) n) at z → b. Theorem 1. Rn (f, b; z) coincides with the logarithmic derivative of the partial amount ∑n k = 0 ck (z - b) k of a number of Taylor function Eα (Z) at point b. Theorem 2. Let the function F Analytical in some vicinity of point b ∈ C, the positive number R is such that a number of Taylor of the Eα (Z) function with the center at point B converges on the circle {z: | z - b | <R}, R = const ∈ (0, R). Then for an arbitrary compact E ⊂ {z: | z - b | ≤ r}, which does not contain the poles of the function F, the unrequited inequality of Lim Sup n → → √ ‖RN (f, b; ·) - f (·) ‖ (e) ≤ r/r is performed. Theorem 3. Let F ∈ H1, B = 0, α (Z) = α (F; Z), 0 <R <1, 144 DR = {Z: | Z | ≤ r}. Then there is such a n> 0 that for all N ≥ n ‖rn (f, b; ·) - f (·) ‖c (dr) ≤ c (‖f‖h1, ‖f‖ (DR)) (DR)) ( rn)/(1 - r), where c (x, y) = (1/π) xe2x/3 (1 + y) ey.

On uniform approximation by logarithmic derivatives of polynomials // ”Theor. functions, its adj. and related cry. ” Mater. School-Honf., dedicated. 130th anniversary of the birth. D.F. Egorova (Kazan, 13–18 September 1999). - Kazan: Publishing House of Kazan. matte. O-va, 1999.-S. 74–77. V.A. Koshcheev (Yekaterinburg) about one overdeck hypothesis relating to the systems of complex functions that satisfy Haar in 1971, continuing the research of Marcheum, Schlenberg and Yang [1], formulated the hypothesis [2], according to which the arreous continuum Q. , allowing the system of linearly independent complex continuous functions, satisfying the condition of Haar, homomorphone with a flat subset. As A. Haar showed in the material case, and A. N. Kolmogorov [3] - in the complex, polynomes according to the system of functions with the condition of the Haar, given and continuously on the compact Q, have the property of the uniqueness of the best approximation for any continuous function, t . Haara condition characterizes Chebyshev systems. We consider the task with additional restriction of NAQ, namely, we require arcuate coherence of not only the Q Continuum itself, but also each of its percontinum and call it 145
