The characterization of traces with suspended inequalities is denoted through the algebra of all the matrices of the nth order above the field C, M+N, M H N-the family of positive and Hermite matrices, respectively. For a, b ∈ MHN, we write A 6 B if 43 b - a ∈ M+n. In [2], a complete description of the class of all functions F is given for which the inequality of TR (AF (A)) 6 TR (AF (B)) (0 6 A 6 B, A, B ∈ MN) is given. If F is a degree function, it is not difficult to prove that for any A, b ∈ M+N, A 6 B, there is TR (A2R+P) 6 TR (arbpar), where r> 0, p> 1. The purpose of this Work - get new characterization of traces with the help of such balanced inequalities on algebra MN. LEMMA 1. Let ∗ is a positive linear functionality on M2, the function F (x) is continuously differentiated and f ′ (x)> 0 on [0, urb). Let for matrices a = λ   1 1 1  , C =   1 - √ α - α α   (λ> 0, α ∈ (0, 1)) The inequality ises (A df (a df (a + tc) dt ∣∣∣∣ t = 0)> 0. Then ∗ is a scalar multiple trace. Theorem 1. Let ∗ - positive linear functionality on mn, function f (x) is continuously differentiated, f ′ (x)> 0 on [0, +urb) and f (0)> 0. If for any a 6 b from m M from m +N the inequality С (AF (A)) 6 | onic (AF (B)) |, then lus is a scalar multiple trace. Note 1. It turns out that if the function F is not constant on (0, و) and onic (AF (B)) ∈ R (or onic (Bf (A)) ∈ R) for any A 6 B of M+N, then ffic is followed. LEMMA 2. Let ∗ is a positive linear functionality on M2, such that with R> 0 and P> 1 for any 44 A, C ∈ M + 2, the inequality ffic (ar d (a + tc) p dt ∣∣∣∣ is performed T = 0 AR)> 0. Then ∗ is a scalar multiple trace. With the help of lemma 2, the following theorem is proved, which is a generalization of some results from [1] and [3]. Theorem 2. Let ∗ - positive linear functionality on MN and at R> 0, P> 1 for any matrices A 6 B from M+N, the inequality ffic (AP+2R) 6 ∗ (arbpar) is made. (*) Then ∗ is a scalar multiple of the trace. Note 2. With p ∈ [0, 1], AP 6 BP follows from A 6 B. Therefore, with R> 0 we have AP+2R 6 Arbpar. Then the inequality (∗) in theorem 2 is true for any positive linear functionality. L and T R A T R A 1.
