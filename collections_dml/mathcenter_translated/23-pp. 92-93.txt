) Degenerate hypergeometric function and solutions of quasi -line equations in its recent work [2, p. 350] L. Simon set the task of the existence of entire solutions of the following quasi -linear equation of an elliptical type: uxx (1 + u 2 x) + 2ucyuxuy + uyy (1 + u 2 y) = 0. (1) the purpose of this report is to show that for for Equation (1) The property of Bernstein has not been performed, that is, there is a non -trivial family of whole solutions. Theorem. For any natural n ≥ 2, there is a whole solution un (x, y), which is material -analytical in the entire plane and grows on infinity as lim sup (x, y) → و (x, y) (x2 + y2) αn /2 = 1, αn = n 2/(2n - 1). At the same time, the following parametric representation occurs x = a (ρ) cos (2n - 1) θ + b (ρ) cos θ, y = a (ρ) sin (2n - 1) θ θ –b (ρ) sin θ, un = (f - ρf ′) cos nθ, (2) where a (ρ) = 1 2 (f ′ - k ρ f), b (ρ) = 1 2 (f ′ + k ρ f), f (ρ) = ρk · φ (k --k2 2, 1 + k; –ρ2 2), (3) φ (a, c; t) - degenerated hypergeometric function of the cummer and k = = n/(n - 1). Since the conversion of the Lyindra was used when constructing N - the UN, the main difficulty is the clarification of which decisions of the obtained linear equation correspond to unambiguous solutions globally defined in R2 (1). Note that the evidence of the injection of this display is based on the properties of the function of the Kummer [1, Ch. 6] and, in particular, for the following statement. 94 lemma. Function A (ρ)/ b (ρ), where A and B are defined B (3), non -negative monotonously increasing, and there is the limiting ratio LIM ρ →+ger A (ρ) b (ρ) = 1 2N - 1.

Ivanshin (Kazan, Pyotr.ivanshin@ksu.ru) The spectrum of one family of operators on a variety with the breakdown, let M - diversity with the placement of F, generated by the locally free action of the switching group of Li H. Let it still (M F) set the integrated connectivity of the Eresman, invariant regarding the action of H. Consider the operatorh = - d2 dx2 +v on L2 (h × p), determined for each layer of laying F, where v ∈ C0 (m), that is, h determines The family of Schrödinger operators (hp) p matter, hp: l2 (rn) → l2 (rn), where n = dim h. Using the Flok representation apparatus [1], the following series of statements can be proved. Drying 1. Let H - compact group. Then the spectrum of the Schrödinger operator h = - D2 dx2 +V continuously depends on the parameter p ∈ P. Drying 2. Spectrum of the Schrödinger operator h =-D2 dx2 + v, where V is evenly a periodic function, there is a limit (celest 95
