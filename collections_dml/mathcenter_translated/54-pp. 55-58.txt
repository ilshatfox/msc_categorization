Methods of approximate solution of the singular integro -radio equations in the problems of diffraction of M.G. Akhmadiev1 1 Bulat-007@mail.ru; Kazan Research Technological University in the work for the numerical solution of the singular integro -disenior equation of the problem of diffraction uses the method of mechanical quadrators. It is proved that this method is resistant to relatively small disturbances of elements of approximating equations. Keywords: close methods, the task of diffraction, the method of mechanical quadrators, the singular integro -differential equations, approximating equations, operator equations. In the works [1] - [6], direct methods of solving the next equation of the wing theory, which has applications in a number of applied tasks, for example, in aerodynamics, theory of elasticity, filtration, management, etc. - 1 π ˆ 1 −1 γ ′ (τ) τ - t d t = f (t) (−1 <t <1), under the conditions γ (−1) = γ (1) = 0. In [2] it was noted that similar results can be obtained for equations of the form 1 π π 1 γ γ ′ (τ) τ - t d t + (tγ) (t) = f (t) (−1 <t <1), where t is quite quite Continuous operator. Following the above works, we consider the singular integro - differential equation found in the tasks of diffraction [7] - [8] d T ˆ 1 −1 onic (τ) τ - t d t + −1 h (t, τ) | τ - t | λices (τ) dτ = f (t) (−1 <t <1), (1) under conditions onic (−1) = onic (1) = 0, (2) where h (t, τ), f (t) - known functions, ∗ (t) - the desired function, λ (0 ≤λ <1) - a numerical parameter, and the singular integral is understood in the sense of the main value of the cat. In this work, for the numerical solution of the problem (1) - (2) the method of mechanical quadrators is used; This is a direct continuation of work [9], where the task is solved by polynomial methods. The theoretical substantiation of the method of mechanical quadrators is carried out using one of the options for the general theory of close analysis methods [10] and the results of the theory of approaching functions. 56 Materials of the International School-Conference is known [1] that the solution to the problem (1)-(2) is submitted in the form of gment √ (τ) = √ 1–τ2 accord (τ), where ∗0 (τ) is a limited function. The approximate solution of the problem (1) - (2) we look in the form (see for example, [1] or [8]) onic (τ) = 1 n +1 n∑ k = 1 (−1) k +1 accord (τk) p 1–τ2un (τ) p 1–τ2 τ --τk = = 1 n +1 n∑ k = 1 onic (τk) n∑ m = 1 tm - 1 (τ) –tm +1 (τ) p 1- τ2 sin (mνk), where νk = kπn+1, τk = cosνk, and tk (τ) and uk (τ) are Polynomas of Chebyshev of the first and second kind, respectively. Following the work [1], [3] and [8], using the properties of the Polynomas of Chebyshev, we find D D T ˆ 1 ip (τ) τ - t dτ = - 2π n +1 n∑ k = 1 ∗ (τk) n∑ k = 1 mum - 1 (t) sin (mνk) = n∑ k = 1 onic (τk) w (τk, t) p 1 - t 2, (3) where W (τk, t) = 2π n n. +1 n∑ m = 1 m sin (mνk) sin (ma), t = cosν. For an integral with a weak feature, we build a quadrature formula. For this purpose, the dodium function h (t, τ) onic (τ) is approximated by the polynoma pτn (hwor) according to the variable τ. Here, through Paper, an operator is indicated, putting in line with any continuous function of its interpolation of Polin Lagrange by nodes τk. Then we have t (hwor) (t) = ˆ 1 −1 h (t, τ) | τ - t | λices (τ) dτ≈ n∑ k = 1 h (t, τk) ng (τk) ˆ 1 −1 lk (τ) | τ - t | λdτ, (4) where LK (τ) is the fundamental polynomas of the lagrange for nodes τk. Thus, using formulas (3) and (4), we obtain a system of linear albraic equations relative to approximate values ​​of the desired function, we denote them through wor (τk). n∑ k = 1 [w (τk, τ j) sin +h (τ j, τk) αk j] wor (τk) = f (τ j) (j = 1.2,.... ) where τm = cosνm; νm = mπ n +1 (m = k, j); αk j = ˆ 1 −1 lk (τ) | τ j τ | λ dτ. We enter into consideration of the space L2, ρ quadratic-dummy functions with a weight ρ (t) = p 1-t 2 with the usual norm. Through L (1) 2, ρ denote the space of the function M.G. Akhmadiev 57 of 57, satisfying the conditions (2), the first derivatives of which are quadratic drilling with a weight ρ (t) ∥icle l (1) 2, ρ = ∥′∥l2, ρ = ∥ accord, ρ = (ˆ 1 −1 ρ (t) | onic ′ (t) | 2D T) 1/2. Let x = l (1) 2, ρ, y = l2, ρ. Then the task (1)-(2) will be written in the form of an operator equivalent equivalent to it, kwor = d d t ˆ 1 −1 onic (τ) τ-t d den+ ˆ 1 −1 h (t, τ) | t --τ | λices (τ) dτ. (6) Theorem. Let F ∈C, H (T, τ) is continuous by variable T and satisfies the condition of the dini-lips according to the variable τ and the equation (6) is unambiguously permitted in X for any right part F ∈ Y. Then with n such that QN = A {ωt (h, 1 n) C + 1 n1 --λ + [ωτ (h, 1 n) c + 1 n1/4] lnn} <1 system (5) has the only solution {∗ (τk)} nk = 1 and approximate solutions onic ∗ n (τ) = 1 n +1 n∑ k = 1 (−1) k +1 accord (τk) p 1–τ2un (τ) √ 1- τ2 k τ --τk converge to the exact solution onic ∗ (τ) with the speed of ∥icle ∗ ∗ ∗ n∥x = o {qn +en - 1 (f) c}, where a is constant, without depending on n, ωs (H, 1 n) C - the continuity module H (·, ·) by variable S evenly relative to the other, and EN -1 (F) C is the best uniform approximation of the function F (t) with algebraic polynomas of the degree of no higher than n −1.
