) Asymptotic behavior of decisions of one class of integro -radical equations is considered with 1 presenting the beginning: ~ task for the integro differentiaal equation with continuous variables hj (t) m1 x '(t) :::: j (t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t -t - l! j (t)) + j = l m2 t + l / kj (t - s) b1 (s) x (s) ds + f (t), z = lo x (t) :: o, t <O, x (o) = ha, (1) (2) where all KJ, AJ, BJ, and F are continuous on [o, oo) integrated function, and the solution x (t) is continuously and once in a piece of line continuously differentia . The asymptotic solutions x (t) are studied in the case when AJ (T), LI J (T), B1 (T) have asymptotic decomposition along the steppe scale in the vicinity +OO, t. e. When uj \ ujk a1 (t), ...., a10 + t + 1 +. . . + (t + l) k + ... , t --t +oo. (3) It is assumed that with some µ> o (4) and that L - · the only most more Bo.L. in the value of the laundry of those, 1st of the root of the equation m1 m2 00 z - l ajae -h1u = - l b10 / e - z t [{j (t) dt = o, rez :::->: µ. (.'5) 1 = 1 j = i o theorem. Let the conditions (3), (4) and the root of L about Sto are fulfilled. Then the solution x (t) of the problem (1) - (2) is represented in the form of x (t) = eat (t + 1) 0 g (t), 122 where a is some 11: 0.mplex number, and g allows the vapor Zhniya (3). Literature 1.

Kolesnikov (Ivanovo, kolesn@ivanovo.ac.ru) about one condition for the continuity of the function of the best approximation from class N00 Let D - a single circle on a complex plane, a single circle; L00 (G) and L2 (G) - respectively, about the wandering of limited measurable functions in g and the space of functions summarized with the square; H00 (G) and H2 (D) of the space of functions that are almost everywhere on g with grace of the values ​​of the values ​​of the values ​​of the analytical functions and functions from H2. Designing ~ i through n: (d) orthogonal addition of H2 (d) in l 2 (g), and through p is the projector on n'3_ (d). Let the function J (z) are defined and continuous on g. The function Y1 (Z) is called the best approximation of function [(: :) in K., ASSE N00 (G), EU., And ll f - yj lloo: 5 ll f - qll, q e n00 (d). In [1] BYOO it is shown that the EU: w row Fourier Fourier Fs absolutely on g, then the G1 function also has a completely converging line of Fourier 11, which means that it is continuous on g. In C: An other calm of the continuity of the function of the best approximation is given a painting theorem. Let ip (z) e l "" "(g). Through AT <. We will designate the Hankel operator attp (j) = p (.pf), f e n2. 123
