) Areas that satisfy the condition of a homogeneous cone on the groups of the carno M-Mauccous group Carno [1] is a coherent single-cylnese nilpotent group of Lee G, algebrah which decomposes into a direct sum of vector spaces V1 ⊕. . . ⊕ vm such that [v1, vk] = vk+1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ m - 1 and [v1, vm] = 83 {0}. Let D (x, y) - metric carno - karateodory of the group G, Deltas (x) = (sixik) - a group of sprains G (see [1, 2]). We denote through b (y, r) the ball in the carno - karateodori metric on G. Let D ⊂ G - some limited area and z ∈ ∂D. We say that D satisfies the condition of the internal homogeneous cone at point Z, if there is a ball b (y (z), r (z)) in the carno -karateodori metric on G such that γz = {zδs (x) | S ∈ (0, S0 (Z)), X ∈ B (Y (Z), R (Z)) ⊂ D. Region D satisfies the condition of the internal homogeneous cone, if it satisfies this condition at its each boundary point Z, and In this case, there is a constant K> 0 such that min {r (z), d (z, y (z))}> k for each point z ∈ ∂d. Also, region D satisfies the condition of an external homogeneous cone, if the G / D area satisfies the condition of the internal homogeneous cone. For areas of carno groups, the concept of a homogeneous cone was introduced by L. Kaponya and N. Harophalo [3] in the study of the properties of solutions of subroilliptical equations. In addition, the region with the condition of a homogeneous cone play an important role in the theory of investments of functional spaces in carno groups [4]. The areas that satisfy the condition of a homogeneous cone are closely related to the regions of John (John region on carno groups are determined relative to the Carno -Karathori metrics in the traditional way, see, for example, [5]). We have installed a theorem. On carno groups, there are limited areas of John that do not meet the conditions of the internal and external homogeneous cones.

Kazantsev (Kazan) The surfaces of Bora-Riman over the Big Disk study algebraic covers of the Big Disk-local compact factorization ∆ = g × [0, 1)/g × {0} cylinder g × [0, 1), where G = γ̂ is a compact Abel group that arises as a group of characters of the subgroup γ ⊂ rdiscr. The latter, as you know, is isomorphically parametrilized by the group of characters ĝ Group G: ĝ = {χa} aives. Each character is χa, a ≥ 0, you can continuously continue on ∆, assuming χa (αr) = χA (α) Ra, α ∈ G, R ∈ [0, 1). The extreme case of this scheme, when γ = rdiscr is the compacting of the boron, gave the name to the indicated coverage, closely related to the riman surfaces due to the presence of a dense complex structure in ∆ everywhere, which is generated by immersion into G of the R̂eUCL group, which turns G into the solenoid. (It is significant that the “opposite” case of the Borovsky case γ = z leads to ∆ = c, that is, to the riman surfaces itself.) The construction of analytical and algebraic structures on the Bigdisa is based on the existence of the algebra of Freche O (∆), the elements of which are generalized analytical Functions, 85
