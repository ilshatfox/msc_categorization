Classification of one subclass of integrated meterized chains of M.N. Kuznetsova1, I.T. Habibullin2 1 mariya.n.kuznetsova@gmail.com; Institute of Mathematics with the UC Ufa RAS 2 habibullinismagil@gmail.com; The Institute of Mathematics with the UTC RAS, the Bashkir State University considers the task of classifying integrated cases of equations of the type of the Toda Toda, X y = f (un+1, un, un -1, un, x, un, y). It is known that the presence of a wide class of integrated reduction indicates the integration of a given equation. We use a classification algorithm based on this observation. The chain is called integrated if there are cliff conditions that reduce it to the endless number of hyperbolic type systems integrated in the sense of Darb. The study of the resulting final system is carried out using the characteristic algebra of the Li-Rinhart. In this work, we will study the subclass of the quasi -clinical chains of the species un, x y = p (un -1, un, un + 1) un, x + r (un -1, un, un + 1) un, y + q (un -1 , un, un+1). Keywords: a double-meter chain, integrated reduction, a characteristic algebra, a degenerate cliff condition, an integrated system, X-integral. Multidimensional equations are the most difficult for integrating and classification. In the study of multidimensional equations, the idea of ​​reduction is often used - information to the system of equations with a smaller number of independent variables. The presence of a wide class of integrated reduction with two independent variables, as a rule, indicates the integrationality of the equation with three independent variables. In the works [1-3] we call the specified equation to the integrated if it allows an endless class of reduction in the form of equations integrated by Darba in private derivatives of a hyperbolic type with two independent variables. When solving classification problems for multidimensional equations in such a production, you can use the apparatus of characteristic algebris Lee. Consider the non -linear chain un, x y = f (un+1, un, un - 1, un, x, un, y) (1) with three independent variables, where the desired function is U = un (x, y) depends on material X , y and the whole n. We set the boundary conditions at two integer points N1, n2z, n1 <n2 −1 un1 = ∗1 (x, y, un1+1, ...), (2) un, x y = f (un+1, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un. un -1, un, x, un, y), n1 <n2, (3) un2 = ng (x, y, un2–1, ...). (4) Determination 1. We will call the chain (1) the integrated if there are functions of 206 materials of the school-conference ising ising ising, which is for any choice of steamed numbers, N2, Odon1 <n2−1, a hyperbolic type system (2)-(4) is integrated according to Darb. In this work, we continue the studies begun in [2.3], where the species integrated in the sense of determining 1, the species of the species un, x y = αnun, Xun, y +pnun, x +rnun, y +QN, (5) were described in the sense of determining 1. Provided that ∂αn ∂un ± 1 ̸ = 0. Here the coefficients depend on the three sequential variables αn = α (un+1, un, un - 1), pn = p (un+1, un, un - 1 ), rn = R (un+1, un, un - 1), QN = Q (un+1, un, un -1). We consider the subclass of the following view chains: un, x y = p (un+1, un, un - 1) un, x+r (un+1, un, un - 1) un, y+q (un+1, un , un -1). (6) We demand that at least one of the derivatives ∂pn ∂un+1, ∂pn ∂un - 1 (7) are not equal to zero. The main result of the work is the following theorem. If the chain (6), (7) is integrated in the sense of determination 1, then it is brought by means of point transformations to one of the following: un, x y = (eun --u - 1 —eun+1-un) un, x, (8) un, x y = (−un +1 +2un qun - 1) un, x. (9) chains (8), (9) were known earlier (see [4]). The work was performed at the expense of the RNF grant (project 15-11-20007). Literature 1. Habibulin I. T.
