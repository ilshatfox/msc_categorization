Lobachevsky, khorevana@mail.ru an important role in the classification of simple algebris Lee over the al -closed field of the field k characteristics p> 0 game the recognition theorem of V. Katz [1], proven in [3] for p> 3. This one. The theorem gives a description of the graduated algebris L = ⊕R I = −Q LI, where L0 is the direct sum of the classic algebris Li, L-1 is an ignorant L0-module, the negative part is born L and 1 and the condition of transitivity is fulfilled: if x ∈ Li, I> 0, x 6 = 0, then [x, l - 1] 6 = 0. In the case of p = 3, the recognition theorem is proved in [2] for q = 1. In this work, the graduated algebras of the characteristics 3 with the local part L -1 +L0 +L1, where L0 is SL (2) or GL (2). In the Algebr Lee class, generated by the local part, there is the only minimum algebra, which is the algebra factor of the algebra Lee generated by forming L -1+L0+L1 and the ratios that are performed in the local part, according to the only maximum degree ideal, which has a trivial The intersection with the local hour. The following results were obtained. Theorem. Let l - the endedly graduated algebra Lee over the algebraically closed field characteristics of 214 ki 3, the minimum among the algebrus Lee, damaged by the local part L -1+L0+L1, where L0 = SL (2) or GL (2), and L -1 - Limited unfinished L0-module. Then L isomorphic one of the following algebra: PSL (3), PGL (3), Podalgebra in the algebra G2, 10 measuring algebra of the series L (ε), contact algebra K (3, 1̄), (SL (2) ⊗ K [x [X ]/(x3)) ⊕ 〈d dx〉, (sl (2) ⊗ k [x]/(x3)) ⊕ d dx, x d dx〉.

The description of the global deformations of the algebra of the type C2 is given in the work [1], [2].
