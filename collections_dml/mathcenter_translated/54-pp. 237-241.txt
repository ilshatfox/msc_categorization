Lykov1 1 alkv@list.ru; Samara National Research University named after Academician S.P. The Queen describes the connection between interpolation and extrapolation structures. It is shown that for a certain class of interpolation spaces obtained by the K -method of material interpolation, there is also an extrapolation description obtained by the replacement in the interpolation structure of the functionality with a parameterized set of accurate interpolation spaces with characteristic functions Tθ, θ ∈ (0.1) (in particular, on a set of spaces of Peter). Keywords: interpolation space, interpolation function, extrapolation space, Peter's spaces, material interpolation method. Suppose that a⃗ = (a0, a1) is a pair of banakhov, i.e. Such a pair of banana spaces that for some Hausdorfovs of the topological space T, continuous investments A0 ⊂ T and A1 ⊂ T. Then, for any element x ∈ T, represented in the form of x = x0 + x1, where x0 ∈ A0 and X1 ∈ A1 can be determined by K -functional: k (t, x; a⃗): = Inf x0, x1: x0 + x1 = x (∥x0∥a0 + t∥x1∥a1), t> 0. Using K -functional, the spaces of the materialk interpolation method are built. If F is a banakhov grille of measurable functions on (0,+∞), then the A⃗KF space is determined by the condition of the limb of the norm ∥x∥a⃗kf: = ∥∥k (t, x; a⃗) ∥∥f. A particular case of such spaces is the spaces of Petra A⃗k θ, Q, θ ∈ (0.1), Q ∈ [1, urb], for which we will use the following norm: ∥x∥θ, Q: = (qθ (1– 11 )) 1 q   +و 0 (t --θk (t, x; a⃗) q d t t  1 q with q <µ, and ∥x∥θ, urb: = sup 0 <t <mm t --θk (t, x; a⃗). 238 Materials of the International School-Conference, we also recall that the interpolation function I is a display from the category of all banana pairs to the category of banach spaces, which has a property: if the linear operator T, determined on A0 + A1 and taking values ​​in B0 + B1, is limited from AI In BI, I = 1.2, the same operator is limited from I (A⃗) to I (B⃗). If at the same time ∥t ∥i (a⃗) → i (b⃗) é max {∥t ∥a0 → b0, ∥t ∥a1 → b1}, then the interpolation function is called The characteristic function of the interpolation function is called the function ρ: t ∈ (0, φ) → (0, urb), determined from the ratio I (R, 1 T R) = 1 ρ (t) R. We will now prove the theorem that connects the interpolation and extrapolation structure . Record ∥x∥1 ≍x∥2 for two norms will mean that with some constant C> 0, independent of element X, inequalities C -1∥X∥1 ∥X∥2 éc∥X∥1 are performed ( Moreover, the uncertainty of one of the norms means the same for another norm). Theorem. Suppose that a⃗ = (a0, a1) is such a banakh that a0 ⊂ a1 and ã0 = a0, where ã0 is a combination of all limits in A1 limited sequences from A0 (the so -called replenishment for Gallicardo). Let x -the space of the K -method of material interpolation: ∥x∥x: = ∥k (t, x; a⃗) ∥f, and, in addition, the operator s: f (t) f (t (t) f (t (t) f (t (t) f (t (t) 2). Then for any family {iθ} θ∈ (0.1) of accurate extrapolate functions with characteristic functions ρIθ (t) = tθ, there is an extrapolation ratio ∥x∥x ≍x∥i log - 1 t (a⃗ ) · Χ (E,+urb) (t) ∥∥∥∥ f. Proof. Recall (see [1, p. 11, (2.10)]) that the following investments are a⃗ j θ, 1 1 1⊂ iθ (a⃗) 1⊂k θ, urb. Here A⃗ J θ, 1 -the space of the J -method of material interpolation, determined using the J -functional j (t, x; a⃗): = max {∥x∥a0, t∥x∥a1} The limb of the norm ∥x∥ a⃗ J θ, 1: = inf strictly measurable function u (t): (0, φ) → a0 ⋂ a1 (see [2, paragraph 3.2]). First, show that A⃗k θ, 1 C⊂ A⃗j θ, 1, K.V. Lykov 239 with a certain constant C> 0, which does not depend on θ ∈ (0.1). The right investment is easy to obtain using a strong form of fundamental lemma of the theory of interpolation (see [3]). According to the fundamental lemma for any x ∈ A⃗j θ, 1 there is such an idea x = ´icle 0 u (s) d s, which ux 0 min (1, t/s) j (s, u (s); a⃗) d s s é γk (t, x; a⃗), t> 0, with some universal constant γ. For such a presentation, we get ∥x∥θ, 1 = θ (1–θ) φ - 0 t - step (t, x; a⃗) d t t θ (1–θ) γ - 1 mm̂ 0 t -θ µ 0 min (1, t/s) j (s, u (s); a⃗) d s d t t θ (1–θ) γ - 1 و 0   µ 0 t --θmin (1, t/s) d t                  J (s, u (s); a⃗) d s θ (1–θ) γ - 1 mm̂ 0 s - θ (1–θ) j (s, u (s); a⃗) d s s = γ - 1 mm ̂ 0 s --θj (s, u (s);
