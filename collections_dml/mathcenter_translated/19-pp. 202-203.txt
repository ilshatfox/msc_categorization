) Generalizations of the inequality of Koshi-Bunakovsky in spaces with indefinite metric in the work [1-2] Generalizations of the inequalities of Koshi-Bunya Kovsky in integral and discrete forms were obtained. For example, the clarification of discrete inequality has the form (1) where the middle part A (x, y) is determined by the arbitrariness. Similar generalizations were obtained for the inequality of Koshi Bunakovsky in the spaces of Minkovsky-Lorenu with a familiar norm. Theorem. Let p p x5-> z :::::: o, u5 - l yt;?: 0. k = i k = l then is fair with the middle part a (x, y) from (1): (Houo - t, x.yk) '~ (Houo - j a (x, y)') '~ 202 The results obtained can be applied to grades of sampling of some integral operators, in the theory of relativity and geometric tasks.
