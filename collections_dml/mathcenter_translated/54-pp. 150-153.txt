UDC 514.764 Geometry of the 6-dimensional H-space type [(33)] Z.Kh. Zakirova1 1 zakirova-kgeu@mail.ru; Kazan State Energy University Studying the geometric properties of multidimensional spaces is an urgent task that has an important theoretical and applied value. It is known that spatio-temporal symmetries give rise to the laws of preservation of energy, impulse and moment of impulse. In particular, infinitezimal projective and affin transformations lead to fundamental field and mechanical laws of preservation in the form of quadratic first integrals of geodetic equations. Interest in multidimensional theories is also associated with the development of supersymmetric theories and the theory of supergravity. As you know, the basis of super -symmetric theories is an increase in the dimension of the variety used. The aim of this article is to study the 6-dimensional pseudoriman spaces V 6 (GI J) with the signature [++----], which allow groups of continuous transformations that preserve geodetic. In this paper, a metric of H-spaceship [(33)] was found, and the type of quadratic first integral of the equations of geodesical this H-space is also indicated. Z.Kh. Zakirova 151 keywords: differential geometry, pseudoriman variety, systems of differential equations with private derivatives. Pseudoriman diversity for which there are non-trivial solutions hi j ̸ = cgi j of Eisenhart equations (see [1]) Hi J, K = 2GI JP, K + GI KI, J + G J Kear, I, called H-spaces. To find a pseudoriman space that allows non -compotetic infinitezimal projective transformation, Eisenhart’s equation must be interpreted. The task of determining such spaces depends on the type of bilinear form LX G, determined by the characteristic of Segre λ-matrix (H −λg). If the characteristic of the tensor LX G is [ABC ...], then we will call the corresponding space the H-space type [ABC ...]. In the work, the integration technique is used in the Kosonormal Rip, in which the Eisenhart equation has the form [2] XR APQ + N∑ H = 1 EH (AHQγH̃PR + APHHH̃QR) = G PR XQware + G QR XP pul (p, Q, R = 1,. ., n), where xr govern ξ μ i ∂xi, γPQR = γQPR = oring, jering Q Iason R J, AI J = HI J - 2Pon, lection I J - components of the normal rapper, g PR = Epδp̃ R and APQ are the canonical forms of the GPR, APQ, γ P LK = EpγL P̃K - ​​components of connectedness in the Crane Rector X. In the case of H-space type [(33)], canonical values ​​are expressed in the form of lami g i j d x i d x j = e3 (2D x1d x3 +d x22) +e6 (2D x4d x6 +d x52), ai j D x i d x j = e3λ3 (2D x1d x3 +d x22) +2e3d x2d x3 +e6λ6 (2d x4d x5 +d x52) +2e6d x5d x6, where e1 = e2 = e3, e4 = e6, ei = ± 1, λ1 = λ3 = λ4 = λ5 = λ6 - roots - roots - roots The characteristic equation DET (AI J (P) −λgi J (p)) = 0. By substituting Eisenharat into the Eisenharat equation, the corresponding canonical values, taking into account the fact that in the case of H-spaceship [(33)] 1̃ = 3 2̃ = 2, 3̃ = 1, 4̃ = 6, 5̃ = 5, 6̃ = 4, we get the system of equations γ16R = γ25R = γ34R, γ26R = γ35R, (1) where R = 1, ..., γ36R are arbitrary , the remaining γpqr invariants are zero. For hprinking type [(33)], the function wor is constant and, therefore, the Hi J tensor will be covariantly constant.
