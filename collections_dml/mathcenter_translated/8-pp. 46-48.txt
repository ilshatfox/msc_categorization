—The genera of the rows according to animated systems in the work, various classes of sequences of L1-footing of the rows according to multiplier systems, as well as the relationship between them. Let {pn} - a sequence of integers, pn ≥ 2, n = 1, 2, ..., m0 = 1, mn = n∏ k = 1 pk; {ψk (x)} - multiplier SIS theme of the price (see [1]) with the forming sequence {pn}. Consider a number of Fourier φ∑ n = 0 anψn (x) functions f (x) ∈ L1 [0, 1]. 46, we denote through SN (F, X) = N-1∑ K = 0 AKψK (X), N-th partial amount of the Fourier of the Fourier function f (x) ∈ L1 [0, 1]. Determination 1. Zol - sequence {ak} belongs to the VP class if for some 1 ≤ p ≤ 2 1 1 n∑ k = 1 kp | ∆AK | p = O (1) for n → urb. Determination 2. Enforcement {ak} belongs to the class FP if for some 1 ≤ p ≤ 2 φ∑ n = 1 m1/p ′ n (mn+1–1∑ k = mn | ∆ak | p) 1/p <mm <mm . Theorem 1. Let for some 1 <p ≤ 2 ak ∈ VP. Then, to fulfill the condition ‖f (x) - sn (f, x) ‖l1 = o (1), n ​​→ φ (1) it is necessary and sufficient to ‖andn (x) ‖l1 = o (1), n ​​→ ∞. (2) Theorem 2. If the sequence AK ∈ V1 ⋂ fp and navy = O (1), then the condition (1) is fulfilled and only when the condition (2) occurs. Analogue of theorem 1 for trigonometric systems is proved in [2], and theorems 2 - in [3]. L and Tr. 47 1. Agayev G.N., Vilenkin N. Ya., Jafarli G. M., Rubinstein A. I.
