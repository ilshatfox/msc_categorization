) The interpolation of the Hermit -Feer in the nodes of Newman in 1964 D. Newmen built rational fractions RN (X), interpoling function | x | In the nodes n = {−1, −a ,. . . - −an -1, 0, an - 1 ,. . . , a, 1}, n = 1, 2 ,. . . , a = a (n) = exp (n - 1/2) such that ‖ | x | −RN (x) ‖C [−1,1] ≤ 3E - √ n. 172 at the same time, as shown in [1], interpolarly polynomas of the lagrange with nodes N for function | x | diverge on the set 0 <| x | <1. In this regard, the question arises of how suitable nodes N are for the interpolation process of the Hermitafeer, which, as you know, has significantly better approximative capabilities compared to the lagrange process. Theorem. Let H2N-1 (G, X)-polynomial ermit-fuel, interpoling function G (x): = x in the nodes of the nd line of the matrix n. Then for any x, 0 <| x | <1, the equality of limn → ° | x --h2n - 1 (g, x) | = +∞. L and T R A T R A 1. Brutman L., Passow E.

Novikov (Samara) Operators of a weak type and independent functions let T: X - → L® [0, 1] - a positively homogeneous operator that is limited from the quasibanach space X into the space of measurable almost every finite functions defined on the segment [ 0, 1] with a measure of Lebegam. Along with the operator t, we consider the operator t̃: xn - → (l °) n, determined as follows: t̃: (XI) و = 1 - → (T XI) ger I = 1. Theorem. Let 0 <p <inous.
