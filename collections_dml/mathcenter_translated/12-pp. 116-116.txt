Some results of the design of the cathode tool A for the dimensional echo A.S. Tikhonov Kaz11SK "1Ji ZOS: Vadar Holly Ververtet E-mail: alexander.'likhonov@ksu.ru The report shows the results of the design of the tool cathode with dimensional electrochemical development (echo) according to the model of the ideal process of a two-dimensional stationary echo, taking into account the overpressure of the anode metal output for current . The setting and solving the specified problem based on the integral transformation of Fourier is devoted to the work [1]. The calculations were carried out both for test examples and for the practice of important ones. A comparison with the results of its predecessors is given. The design of the cathode is used in the test example of the exemplary cathode - symmetric coal with a solution of 90 and with a solution of 270 Â° solution, respectively, with a constant single release on the current. The decision of the Cathode Plastin day parallel to the direction of supply is inherent both using the automatic selection of the parameter of the regionalization and with subsequent manual adjustment of the resulting cathode. In conclusion, pro The form of the cathode is considered, profiled by the inner wall of the gear of the internal gear. Literature 1. Kuznetsov A.V., Tikhonov A.S.
