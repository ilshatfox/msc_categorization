. The diffusion model of the cosmological evolution of the cosmic rays of R.A. Ziatdinov, Yu. G. Ignatiev Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University, Kazan, rushanziatinov@yandex.ru Cosmic rays can be considered as the remainder of the first initial spectrum of superflower particles, then their cosmolus is an important evolutionary evolution It can be described by kinetic equii, which, provided that the transmitted impulse and the presence of squaling, can be brought to the type of Lan Dau equation, which describes particle diffusion in the area with small and large impulses [1]: ∂g ∂τ = 1 x2 ∂x x2 ( ∂g ∂x + 2b (τ) g), (1) 109 The equation (1) should be solved with some initial and boundary conditions, as well as the function G (x) = G (0, X) must satisfy the integral conditions φ∫ 0 G (x) x2DX = 1, وI 0 G (x) x3DX = 1. (2) we will assume that b (τ) is small, but different from zero. Then, decomposing equation (1) in a row in small size b (τ) and presenting its solution in the form of a row G = G0 + G1 +. . . , for zero approximation, we get a solution to the equation of the heat of the water in the spherical system of the coordinate G0 (τ, x) = 1 2x √ πτ ipp (y) [e - (x -y) 2 4τ - e - e - (x+y) 2 4τ] Y Dy. For linear in b (τ) amendments, the corresponding heterogeneous equation of thermal conductivity was obtained, the solution of which is presented in the following form: g1 (τ, x) = 1 x √ ∫ τ 0 1√ T ∫ et, ₽) ă ∫ و –ura E - (x - y) 2 4t × × g0 (t, y) (1 + y2 2 t - x y 2 t) DY DME DT. The found solution is numerically interpreted in the Maple math -math package and is presented graphically. L and T R A T R A 1. Ignatiev Yu.G. // Izv. universities.

Infinite set A = {A0 <A1 <A2. . . }, A ⊂ ω is called strongly imaginary if there is a calculated linear order of the following type L: η + a0 + η + a1 + η + a2 + η +. . . Where η is a dense linear order. Rosenstein found that each strong η-representative set is ∆03-nomination. He proved that all σ 0 2 sets are strongly representative. Fellner is still the same for the π02-monk. Lerman built an example ∆ 0 3-many, which is not very contrasting. Dounini raised the question of the study of ∆03 degrees, which contain strongly contrasting sets. In particular, is it that every ∆03-spectacle contains a lot of η an individual? A negative answer to this question was received. Theorem 1. There is an inexpensive set of a ∈ ∆3, such that if B6TA and B are strongly representative, then B is computable. Theorem 2. If a is a strongly representable set, then there is a computable function F (t, i, s), such that a = ⋃و = 0 (a2i —2i+1), where ai = {t ∈ ω | lims f (t, i, s) = 1}, and 111
