UDC 517.95 A mixed task for a one-dimensional b-hyperbolic equation with an integral condition of the second kind of N.V. Zaitseva1 1 n.v.zaiceva@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky for a hyperbolic equation with the Bessel operator studied a mixed task with an integral condition of the second kind in a rectangular area. The solution was built in the form of a series of Fourier -Bessel. Theorems of uniqueness, existence and sustainability of solving the problem have been proved. To substantiate the existence of a solution to the problem, sufficient conditions were obtained regarding the initial conditions, guaranteeing the convergence of the built row in the class of regular decisions. Keywords: hyperbolic equation, Bessela operator, non -valuable integral condition, unity, existence, stability, a number of Fourier - Bessel, uniform convergence. Consider in the rectangular region d = {(x, t) | 0 <x <l, 0 <t <t}, where l, t> 0 146 materials of the conference are given real numbers, the hyperbolic equation of the type �b u (x , t) ≡ ut t −x --k ∂ ∂x (xk ux) = 0, (1) where k ̸ = 0 is a given actual number. The study of regional tasks for the singular equations is one of the important sections of the modern theory of differential equations in private derivatives [1 - 4], due to their numerous applications in gas dynamics, magnetic hydrodynamics, theory of shells and other areas of science and technology. Recently, in the theory of differential equations with private derivatives, the direction of the theory of non -bore tasks has been developing violently. This is due to the need to summarize the classical tasks of mathematical physics and setting up qualitatively new ones caused by the tasks of modern natural science. The illocal tasks for various classes of differential equations are investigated in the works of many authors [5 - 12]. An extensive study of the regional tasks with non -cabbile integral conditions for hyperbolic equations is presented in the work [13 - 15]. In [16], the initial tasks for the equation (1) under K> −1 with an integral condition of the second kind are studied. In this work, for equation (1) in the field of D, we examine the mixed task with a non -leg integral condition of the second kind at K ≤ - 1. Without losing community in further reasoning, we put that l = 1, since equation (1) is invariant regarding the replacement of x1 = x/l, y1 = y/l. Formulation of the problem. Find the function u (x, t) that meets the conditions: u (x, t) ∈C 1 (d) ∩c 2 (d), �b u (x, t) ≡ 0, (x, t) ∈ D, u (x, 0) = onic (x), ut (x, 0) = ψ (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, u (0, t) = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ t, (xk --1u ( x, t)) ′ x ∣∣∣ x = 1 + 1∫ 0 u (x, t) x d x = 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ t, where scrates (x), ψ (x) are set quite smooth functions that satisfy the conditions coordination (xk -1 accord (x) ′ x ∣∣∣ x = 1 + 1∫ 0 onic (x) x d x = 0, (xk -1ψ (x)) ′ x ∣∣∣ x = 1 + 1∫ 0 ψ 0 ψ (x) x d x = 0.

The method of spectral analysis [17] proved theorems of uniqueness, existence and stability of solving the problem, as well as auxiliary lemma 1 - 3 to justify the convergence of a series (3) in the class of regular solutions.

If Funsion pul (x) ∈C 2 [0.1] and there is a production pul ′ ′ ′ (x), which has a final change to [0.1], the function ψ (x) ∈C 1 [0.1] and there is a derivative ψ ′ ′ (x), which has a final change to [0.1], and onic (0) = ψ (0) = onic (1) = ψ (1) = onic (0) = ψ ′ (0) = ∗ ′ (1) = ψ ′ (1) = onic ′ ′ (0) = onic ′ ′ (1) = 0, then estimates | onic | ≤c7n - 4, | ψn |
