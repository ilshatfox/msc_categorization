Some properties of integrated periodic operas and tori -tori, the properties of operators of the type 1 - P are investigated, where it is a neutral, local compact, nervous relative to labor (<) - a periodic operator operating in the VSP (R1) - the space of continuous and limited on R1 integrated vector function, llxll = supljx (t) ijc. "So far, t is on that such an operator can be presented in the form of - 00 px = j (dsp (l, s)) x (s), where p (t, where P (t, s) = {pij (t, s)}-comprehensive-OS NIGHTURAL P X N-matrix, which, with each T of R1, is limited to R1 variation and satisfying the conditions: 00 1) lim v [pij (t + h, s. )-pij (t, s)] = o, t e r1, i, j = 1, p; h--to-oo 00 2) Sup v pij (t, s) <oo, i, j = 1, p; 3) p (t + "-', s + w) = p (l, s). t -OO for operator P, we determine the function P (~), taking the values ​​in. S (joint venture [o, w], joint venture ~ o, Шj, believing 00 "" p (~) = l: with "f (dsp (t , s-mw)) x (s), ~ e 51 = {~ e c1: 1 ~ 1 = 1}. M = -OO O denotarize through p (p) the many own numbers of the function P (o, that is, many of these ~ E 5 1, for which the operator 1 p (about the irreversible, and for ~ e (p), put A (~) = dim ker (1 - p (~)). It turns out that every ~ e r (p) can be built a (whether the nosos independent elements from Ker (j- p) of the type of EHR ((-w- 1 ~ n ~) t) bj (t), bj (t + w) = bj (t), j = 1, 2 , "" a (~). We denote through the closure of the linear shell of the many EHR ((-w-1 ln ~) t) bj (l), j = 1, 2, "., a (o, ~ e r (p (r (p. ). Theorem 1. Let.
