UDC 517.544 Martsinkevich indicators and the task of leaps for β-analytical functions D.B. Kats1 1 katzdavid89@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in this paper we study the task of leap and some solutions to the Belters equation. Both the task of the jump and the equations of Belters have numerous applications in physics and mechanics. They are studied for cases of analytical (i.e. 0analytic) functions and hidden contours. We are discussing these issues for cases ofβ-analytical functions and indestructible curves. Expanding the well -known technology of solving these problems for such cases, we get previously unknown results. Keywords: fractals, fractal, Martsinkevich indicators, metric characteristics, indestructible curves. One of the extremely demanded in the mechanics and physics of generalizations of the equations of the Kosha -Riman (see, e.g., [1]) is the equation by the underwear ∂φ = µ∂φ, | µ (z) | <1 here, as usual, ∂: = 1 2 (∂x + i ∂ ∂ ∂), ∂: = 1 2 (∂x - i ∂ ∂ y) in the case of µ (z) = βz, 0 ≤ β <1 right reverse operator for the differential operator under the ∂––µ∂ (an analogue of the famous operator t from [1]) was explicitly found by the Kazakh mathematician A. Tungatarov [3]. The decisions of the corresponding equation by the underwear are called β -analytical functions. Nowadays, the study of the analogues of the analogues of the regional task of Riman and the related issues for such functions have been further developed in the works of mathematicians such as Ricardo Abreu-Blai, Juan Bori-Rayes, Dixan Peni-Peni and Zhanmaria Vilier (see [4], [4], [4], [4]. 6]). For analytical (i.e. 0 analtic) functions, the regional task of Riemann is well studied in the following setting: let γ have a oriented curve on D.B. Katz 185 of a complex plane on which the functions G (t) and G (t) are set. It is required to find all the holomorphic in C \ γ functions φ (z), which have continuous limit values ​​φ+(t) and φ - (t) on the left and right, respectively, disappearing at an infinitely removed point and satisfying the regional condition φ+(t) = G (t) φ - (t)+ g (t), t ∈ γ. The classic results in this area [7] were obtained for the case of a piece of smooth contour. On indestructible contours, the task of Riemann for analytical functions was solved by B.A. Katsa [9]. Ricardo Abreu-Blai, Juan Bori-Rayes, Dixan Peni-Peni and Jean-Maria Vilier used the methods proposed in these works to solve the problem of Riman and the task of leaps for β-analytical functions on indestructible curves. They obtained the following conditions for the resolving of such tasks. Let γ - a lot on a complex plane, 0 <ν≤ 1. Class Ha (γ) consists of the functions f (t), which satisfy the condition of the Hölder Ha (f; γ): = sup {| f (t) - f (t ′) | | t - t ′ | ν: t, t ′ ∈ γ, t ̸ = t ′} <φ If a lot γ is compact, then its dimension of Minkovsky [10] is determined by the equality of dmγ: = limsup ε → 0+ log n (γ ; ε) - logε, where n (γ; ε) means the smallest number of circles of radius ε, forming the coating γ. Such a dimension of a flat continuum always lies in the interval [1; 2]; If γ is a hidden curve, then dmγ = 1, and for an indestructible curve, Minkovsky's dimension can exceed a unit. The work [5] proven that the task of leaps (a special case of the problem of Riemann with G ≡ 1) for β -analytical functions on the indestructible circuit γ is permitted if G ∈ Ha (γ), and ν> 1 2 dmγ. (1) Further, in [6], the solvability of the problem of the Riemann for β -analytical functions at the indestructible circuit γ is established in the assumption that the circuit is a dsumamy, and the gelder condition with the indicator ν> d/2 satisfy the task of the task of Gelder. (2) The concept of D-Summianess was introduced by J. Harrison and A. Norton [11]; The γ circuit is called D-Sumy if the integral ˆ 0 n (γ; x) xd-1d x conges. As shown in [11], d-sumemism of γ entails the inequality of DMγ≤ D, and with dmγ <D, the multiple γ is D-Summable. 186 Materials of the International School-Conference recently the author [12], [13] introduced a new metric characteristic of indestructible curves-the indicator of Martsinkevich. The purpose of this report is to show that this characteristic allows you to weaken the conditions 1 and 2.
