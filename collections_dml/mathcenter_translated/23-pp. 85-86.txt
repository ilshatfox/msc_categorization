Rational approximations of functions such as Makarov -Stiltyes in the Hard Hard space for any element f of its smallest evasion from the totality of RN ⊂ HP - rational functions of the degree not higher than n - we denote through HPRN (F). In the assumption that the measure µ is absolutely continuous on the segment [−1; 1] and its density µ ′ with some A, b ∈ (−1; + و) satisfies the condition µ ′ (x) ³ (1– x) a (1 + x) b with x → ± 1, x ∈ ( - - - 1; 1), (1) denote µ̂ (z) = ∫ 1 −1 dµ (x) 1– xz. Theorem 1 (N. S. Vyacheslavov). Let the parameters p ∈ (1; +∞], a, b ∈ (−1/p; +φ) are fixed and weak asymptotic (1) is fair. σ is the average harmonic numbers a + 1/p and b + 1/p. Theorem 2 (E.P. Mochalina). We fix the parameter P from the interval (0, 1) and the measure µ, the density of which satisfies the condition (1). 87 Then, for each natural value n, the inequality of HPRN (µ̂) ≥ Cnν (p) exp {−π √ σn}, where the degree ν (p) = 1/2 - [1/p+1] is performed, and the square brackets indicate the whole Part of the number concluded within them; the positive value of C does not depend on the n.

Gaysin (Kazan, Tagir.gaisin@ksu.ru) About the principle of the maximum for diversity over algebras found the type of A-differentiated functions on some varieties over local algebras, including compact ones. We use the results set forth in [1], [2], [3]. It is known that a ∼ = rd (a) ⊕r, ah ∼ = rd (a) h ⊕ rh [1]. As you know [1], A-differentiated functions G: am → A, Dimr A = N, have the form: G = EI · GI, I = 0 ,. . . , n - 1, where the EI is an attentive basis of the local algebra A, GI in a certain special material basis (which we will call standard), have the form: G (X1,., XM) = G (X1,., XM, XM ) + n∑ | p | = 1 1 p!
