) Operators of a weak type and independent functions let T: x - → l ° [0, 1] - a positively homogeneous operator that is limited from the quasibanach space X into the space of measurable almost every final functions determined on the segment [0, 1] with the measure of Lebugam . Along with the operator t, we consider the operator t̃: xn - → (l °) n, determined as follows: t̃: (XI) و = 1 - → (T XI) ger I = 1. Theorem. Let 0 <p <inous. The following statements are equivalent: 173 1) the operator T is limited from the space X to the space LP, ∞. 2) there is Q ∈ (0, P] that the operator t̃ acts from the space LP, Q (X) to the space L (I) ° (Linger). 3) the operator T̃ acts from the space lp (x) to the space l (F) ° (linger). If the operator t is invariant relative to the shift, then each of the conditions 1) - 3) is equivalent to the condition 4) there is Q ∈ (0, P] that the operator T̃ acts from the space LP, Q (X) to the space l ° (linger) = {(XI) ∈ (LQ) N: SUP I | XI | <aged almost everywhere}. Let us explain the designations used in the formulation of the theorem: lp, ∞ = {x ∈ L odd: ∃c> 0: M (t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: t: | x (t) |> τ) ≤ c/τp}, τ> 0; lp, q (x) = {(XI) ∈ XN: (‖XI) ∈ LP, Q}; L (I) ® ( lip) (respectively, l (f) ° (lday)) consists of all followers (xi) ∈ (l °) n those that if with each i ∈ N function XI and XI are equal to the equally proper -probative sense of the function (respectively, the functions of the XI and XI are equally proper), then SUP I | XI | <aged almost everywhere. The XI functions are determined, generally speaking, in another probabilistic space. Operators, limited from LP to LP, ux, are called low -type operators P Thus, the theorem gives, in particular, the probabilistic characterization of such operators. Close to 3) The condition was used by E. M. Nikishin [1] to describe operators who allow factorization through the space of LP, urb. L and T R A T R A 1. Nikishin E. M.
