The CQ [0, 1] space of the determination of the differential operator is denoted through DL by the determination of the differential operator LY = Y (N) (X) + P2 (X) Y (N -2) (X) +. . . + pn (x) y (x), pj (x) ∈ C [0, 1], x ∈ [0, 1] (1) with the edge conditions of the type: vj (y) = uj (y) - (y, ip) = 0 (j = 0, 1.., N), (2) where uj (y) = n - 1∑ k = 0 (ajky (k) (0) + bjky (k) (1)) , (y, worj) = 1∫ 0 y (x) ip (x) dx, uction (x) ∈ C [0, 1]. We assume that the forms of uj (y) are normalized ([1], p. 65-66). Operators of the type (1)-(2) are found, e.g., in [2]. 88 Theorem. Cut DL by the norm of space CQ [0, 1] (q = 0,., N - 1) coincides with many functions from CQ [0, 1], satisfying those conditions from (2) in which uj (y ) do not contain derivatives of order above Q. In the case of ∗j (x) ≡ 0 (j = 1,., N) and q = 0 This result is contained in [3].
