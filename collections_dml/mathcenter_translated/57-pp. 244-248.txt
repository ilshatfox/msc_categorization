Introduction The process of describing the analytical dynamics of mechanical systems consists in constructing differential movements of movements, the solutions of which satisfy the required conditions. Famous dynamic analogies [1.2] allow the use of the principles and methods of classical mechanics to build the equations of the dynamics of a controlled system consisting of elements of various physical nature. The necessary kinematic properties of the system are set by some ratios between the coordinates and speeds of the system, which are determined by the equations of contact ties [3], the equations of servos [4], or the equations of software ties [5], corresponding to the purposes of control [6,7], when additional conditions are superimposed. on the movements of the system along the integral diversity determined by the equations of the connections, and in its environs. The determination of control influences in accordance with the traditional method of Lagrange multipliers used in classical mechanics leads to the fact that the connections imposed on the system represent the first integrals of the equations of the dynamics of the closed system, which leads to the need to coordinate the initial conditions with the relations of relations. At the same time, the numerical solution of the equations of the dynamics of the closed system is unstable in relation to the equations of relations, and the stabilization of the connections is ensured by the representation of the disturbances of the connections by linear differential equations [8]. However, this can lead to the instability of the trivial solution of the equations of disturbances in relations if the characteristic equation has equal roots [9]. In the general production, the task of stabilizing relationships is reduced to determining the expressions of Lagrange multipliers or control influences in which the connections are described by private integrates of the speaker equations of the controlled system, R.G. Mukharlyamov, K.Z. Askarova, I.E. Kaspirovich 245 and the corresponding integral diversity sustainably asymptotically. The right part of the system of differential equations dx/dt = x (x, t), x = (x1,., XN) that allows private integrals F (X, T) = 0, F = (F 1,.. f m), m é n, is determined from equalities: fx+ft = φ (f, x, t), x = vτ+vν, fvτ = 0, f = 〈∂f ∂x〉, vν = f+(φ, x, t) - ft), f+ = ft (fft) −1, φ (0, x, t) = 0. Stabilization of the connections set by the equations dx dt = v, m (x) dv dt = x (x, v , t)+ (b (x, v, t), λλ). f (x, t) = 0, σσ (x, v, t) = 0, σσ = (σ1,., σr), x (t0) = x0, v (t0) = v0, (1) is ensured , if the left part of the equation of the differential bonds of the exam (x, v, t) = 0, lus press = (ḟ, σσ) satisfies the condition d accord, t) dt = φ (f, ip, ffic, x, v, t), φ, φ, φ, φ (0.0, x, v, t) = 0, ḟ = (D F 1 dt,., D f m dt), (2) of which the λλ multipliers are determined in the right part of the dynamics equation (1). In particular, equality (2) can be represented by a linear differential equation: d dt   fḟ σσ         0 М 0k10 k11 K12 K21 K22     σσσ  , which is at K10 = ω2IM, K11 = 2αIMM , K12 = k20 = k21 = 0, k22 = γir corresponds to the method of J. baumgarte [8]. The well -known modifications of the J. Baumgarte method in relation to the index systems (M +1), M> 2, are either limited to the private type of combination of relations equations with their derivatives [9], or directly used for the subsystem described by the equations of mechanics [10]. The solution to the problem of managing the system, taking into account the dynamics of executive devices, leads to the need to develop general methods for stabilizing relationships in higher order systems [11]. 2.
