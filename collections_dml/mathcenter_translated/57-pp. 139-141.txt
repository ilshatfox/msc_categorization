N.I. Lobachevsky 2 lbmironova@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, the Elabuga Institute for the coefficients of Gurs and Koshi for the equation of the third order Bianchi, which requires to find a solution with an additional search for the coefficients of the equation, is proposed a new approach to highlighting options for resolving these tasks in an explicit form. Instead of the introduction of additional boundary conditions for these purposes, it is proposed to set conditions that allow factorize the differential equation. Keywords: Gurs’s task, the task of Koshi, factorization, Bianchi equation, Rieman's function, and permissibility in quadrature. In the parallelepiped d = {x0 <x1, y0 <y <y1, z0 <z <z1}, consider the equation UX Y Z +Aux Y +Buy Z +Cuxz +Dux +Euy +F Uz +G U = 0, (1) It is one of the equations with the dominant private derivative, the theory of which has been developing intensively in recent decades. Many of the already obtained results can be found in monographs [1] - [2]. The task of Gurs for (1) is to find its solution that satisfies the conditions u | x = ∗ (y, z), u | y = ng (x, z), u | z = ∗3 (x, y). (2) here x, y, z - the edges D at x = x0, y = y0, z = z0, respectively. We assume that the conditions of smoothness a ∈C (1.1,0), b ∈C (0.1.1), c ∈C (1.0.1), d ∈C (1.0.0), are fulfilled. e ∈C (0.1,0), f ∈C (0.0,1), g ∈C (0.0.0), ∗1 ∈C (1.1) (x), ∗2 ∈C (1 1) (y), ∗3 ∈C (1.1) (z), (3) as well as the conditions for coordination on the ribs d wor (x, z0) = ∗3 (x, y0), ng (y, z0) = ∗3 (x0, y), ng (y0, z) = ∗2 (x0, z). (4) In [3], the Riman method has built a solution to this problem (see also [1]), and the solution formula received there should only be considered structural, since only the fact that it exists is known about the function of Riman. There are certain results related to the construction of Riemann function in explicitly [1, p. 35–46], [2, § 2 from chapter 3]. Objective. To deliver the conditions of the Gurs problem in terms of coefficients of equation (1). The approach to the determination in the equation of unknown coefficients, based on the introduction of additional boundary conditions, is well known. We replace 140 materials of the conference of this approach with restrictions on the structure of the equation related to the possibilities of its factorization. We use the following options for recording the equation (1) in a factorized form: (∂x +α) (uy z +βuy +γuz +δu) = 0, (5) (∂2 ∂y∂z +β ∂y +γ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂z +Δ) (ux +αu) = 0, (6) (∂ ∂y +α) (uxz +βux +γuz +δu) = 0, (7) (∂2 ∂x∂z +β ∂x +γ ∂ ∂z +δ) (uy +αu) = 0, (8) (∂ ∂z +α) (ux y +βux +γuy +δu) = 0, (9) (∂2 ∂x∂y + β ∂x +γ ∂y +δ) (UZ +αU) = 0. (10) In this case, we believe that α ,. . . , Δ for each option. Find the conditions that provide an idea (1) in the above form. We will write the results obtained in the terms of the designations: h1 = Ax +AB —E, H2 = AY +AC - D, H3 = BY +BC - F, H4 = BZ +AB —B, H5 = CX +BC - F, H6 = CZ +AC - D, H7 = DX +BD - G, H8 = Ey +CE - G, H9 = FZ +A F - G, K1 = By Z +Aby +CBZ +BD - G, K2 = CXZ +ACX + BCZ + CE - G, K3 = AX Y + CAX + Bay + A F - G. We demand that the ratio coefficients (5) coincide with the coefficients of the equation (1). As a result, we obtain equalities α = b, β = a, γ = c, Δ = D, which occur if H1 ≡ H5 ≡ H7 ≡ 0. Similarly, we act when considering the remaining options for factorization of the equation (1). As a result, we get the conditions that are groups of identity for A ,. . . , G, providing an idea (1) in any of the listed factorized forms. Each of the factorized equations can be represented in the form of a system of two equations. For example, (6) can be replaced with a pair UY Z +Auy +Cuz +Du = V, VX +BV = 0. (11) The boundary conditions go to U (X, Y0, Z) = ivil (Y, Z), u (x, y, z0) = ∗3 (x, y), (12) v (x0, y, z) = ∗1y z (y, z)+a (x0, y, z) ∗1y (y, z) + C (x0, y, z) ∗1z (y, z)+ D (x0, y, z), uction (y, z) = ψ1 (y, z). (13) The task (1) - (2) goes into two, and they should be solved alternately: first you need to find the function V (X, Y, Z) from the second equation (11) by condition (13), and then solve V. AND. Zhegalov, L.B. Mironova 141 Equation for U (y, z) with the already known function V (first equation B (11) with conditions (12)). The latter is the classic task of Gurs for the second -order equation (X is considered as a parameter). In other cases, pairs of consistently solved tasks are also obtained: one trivial (for the first -order equation), the other for the equation of the type Ux y +pux +quy +r u = ω (the task of the Gurs). The conditions for solvability of this task of Gurs are explicitly obtained on the basis of the Riman method according to the formula (1.20) from [1] are known [4] - [6]. They are recorded in the form of relationships connecting the coefficients p, q, r. As a result of the application of the indicated ratios to the second -order equations obtained in the process of replacing equations (5) - (10) systems of equations, we are convinced
