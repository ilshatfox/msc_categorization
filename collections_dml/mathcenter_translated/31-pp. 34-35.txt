Streamed wing profile with devices of active control of the stream of R. A. Gaifutdinov NIMM of Kazan State University, rinrinrin@mail.ru in this work continued the research of S.E. Belousov [1] to build a streamlined symmetric profile with the selection of fluid from the external stream and blowing out In the stern. The idea of ​​considering this task belongs to L. I. Sedov, and its implementation was carried out by G. Yu. Stepanov [2] using the formula of Keldysh - Sedov. The analytical solution of the same problem is given in [1], but using the Signorini formula. Based on the analytical formulas of work [1], an algorithm and a program of their numerical implementation were compiled. A series of numerical calculations was carried out. From their analysis, conclusions were drawn about the impact of selection and blowing on the aerodynamic characteristics of the built profile. The results obtained are tested by the direct method using the Fluent program. I express my gratitude to the scientific leader Professor N. B. Ilyinsky for the proposed topic of research. The work was supported by the RFFF, project 05–08–01153 and FCNTP, the RI --112/001/465 project. L and T R A T R A 1. Belousov S.E.

Galaev Saratov State University, rector@sgu.ssu.runnet.ru Classification of the algebra of the riman diversity (agrm) is a well -known classical result [1 ]. This work sets out the classification of the algebra of the Hydronomy of the Lorentsev diversity (AGLM). The algebra of the n + 2-dimensional diversity of diversity can be identified with the gaggra g ⊂ so (1, n + 1) (n ≥ 0). The theorem S. Wu and the results of M. Bergeta [1] allow us to consider only poorly irrelevant, which are not irrelevant (CH) Aglm G ⊂ SO (1, N + 1) (all such algebra G does not have its own invariant unbearable subspace in R1, N +1, but has an invariant isotropic line l ⊂ R1, n + 1, therefore G is found in parabolic subpassion SO (1, N + 1) L ⊂ SO (1, N + 1)). For Podalgebras g ⊂ so (1, n + 1), consider the space r (g) = {r ∈ Hom (∧2r1, n + 1, g) | r (u ∧ v) w + r (v ∧ w) u + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + R (w ∧ u) v = 0 for all u, v, w ∈ R1, n+1} tensors of curvature type G. Determination 1. Podalgebra G ⊂ so (1, n + 1) is called an algebra of a berge if span {r (∧2r1, n + 1) | r ∈ R (g)} = g. 35
