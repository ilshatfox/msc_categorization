Limited weight (q, p) –ISKENT with minimal regularity and their properties S.K. Vodopyanov1 1 vodopis@math.nsc.ru; Federal State Budgetary Institution of Science Institute of Mathematics. S.L. Sobolev SB RAS, Novosibirsk State University We give the properties of display with θ-ovy (q, p) the border distortion. The main attention is paid to modular inequalities for displaying this scale and their applications. Keywords: quasiconic analysis, Sobolev’s space, Poletsky function, the module of the Krivn family, modular assessment. In the works [1,2], the basic properties of the next class of display are investigated. Definition. Let θ: rn → [0, urb]-a measurable function (called weight) is such that 0 <θ <imes n-soh is everywhere. Display f: ω → rn, n ≥ 2, is called the display C (internal) limited θ-spring (q, p) –– (briefly: f ω; q, p; θ, 1)), n −1 ≤ q ≤ p <inous, if: 1) F continuously, open and discrete; 2) F belongs to the Sobolev class w 1 n - 1, loc (ω); 3) Jacobian j (x, f) ≥ 0 for n. x ∈ Pi; 4) Display F has a final coin: adjd f (x) = 0 p. on many steen z = {x &: Detd f (x) = 0}; 5) the function of the local θ-spring (q, p) —Phi ω x 7 → k θ, 1q, p (x, f) =  θ n-1 q (x) | adjd f (x) | J (x, f) n -1 p, if j (x, f) ̸ = 0, 0 otherwise belongs to the class lϱ (ω), where ϱ is from the condition of 1 ϱ = n - 1q - n --1p (ϱ = = = ϱ = ∞ with q = p). Enter the following designation k θ, 1q, p (f; ω) = ∥∥k θ, 1q, p (·, f) | Lϱ (ω) ∥∥. In [1, 2] it was shown that in the case of θ ≡ 1, q = p = n class ID (ω; n, n; 1.1) coincides with the class of display with limited distortion, the foundations of the theory of which were laid in the 60s last century Yu.G. Reshetnyk. Recall that the display f = (F1,., FN): ω → RN of the Sobolev class w 1n, LOC (ω) is called a display with a limited distortion, if inequality | D F is performed for H N-CHICH OF ALL CHOUSED. x) | n é k j (x, f), 90 materials of the school-conference where k ∈ [1, urb)-constant, d f (x) = (∂ fi ∂x j (x)) i, j = 1,. .., n - Matrix Jacobi, | d f (x) | and j (x, f) - its operator norm and determinant, respectively. The fundamental topological result of Yu. G. Reshetnyak [3] lies in the fact that any inconsistent display with limited distortion continuously, openly and discretely. The behavior of the module of the family of curves during the display of the class ID (ω; q, p; θ, 1) is formulated in the following statement. Theorem 1. Let F: ω → Rn-display with limited θ-spring (q, p) distortion, n −1 <q é p <mm, and weight function ω (x) = θ-n-1 q-(n −1) (x) locally summarizes RUME. If γ is the family of curves in the area ω, then the inequality is fair (mods f (γ)) 1/s ék θ, 1q, p (f; ω) (modωr γ) 1/r, (1) where s = pp - ( n - 1), r = q q - (n - 1). Here γ is the family of curves in the region ω ⊂ rn, n ê 2. The Borelic function ρ: ω → [0, urb] is called permissible for γ, if γ ρd S ê 1 for each locally hidden curve γ ∈ γ. The totality of all permissible functions is denoted by Admγ. For the weight function ω: rn → (0, φ) and p ∈ [1, urb) we determine the ω-spring p-module of the family γ with the formula modωp γ = inf The weight function is supposed to be locally summarized and 0 <ω <imes H N-Help is everywhere. With ω ≡ 1, we get the usual definition of the P-module, and instead of MOD1P γ we write modp γ. If admγ = ∅ (this case is realized only when the γ family has at least one curve that sets a constant display), then we believe the Modωp γ = urb. The key tool in the evidence of the formulated theorem is the generalization of Lemma Poletsky from [4], which describes the totality of “suitable” parameterizations for the Curves of the Family F (γ) = {f γ ∈ γ}. Theorem 1 gives a positive answer to the question of work [5] on the receipt of modular inequalities of type (1) for general families of curves, provided that F ∈W 1 n - 1, LOC. From inequality (1), capacitive grades of work can be obtained [1, 2]. It should be noted that in a number of tasks, modular inequalities make it possible to obtain more subtle results compared to the corresponding capacitive research under partial financial support for the fundamental research program SB RAS (project No. 0314-2016-0006), partial support of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (state assignment No. 1.3087. 2017/4.6 and agreement No. 02.a03.21.0008), and partial support of the RFFI Grant (project code No. 17-01-00801).
