Saifullo2 1 Faizullo100@yahoo.com; Bokhtar State University named after N. Khusrava, Tajikistan 2 smpk1992@mail.ru; Bokhtar State University named after N. Khusrava, Tajikistan in the work for one reduced system of differential equations of the second order obtained the presentation of the variety of solutions in explicitly, when the coefficients of the first equation, interconnected in a certain way. The properties of the decisions obtained were studied, and the task with the initial data K1 was also considered. Key words: a redundant system, diversity of solutions, a rectangle, a singular coefficient, the properties of solutions, let D rectangle d = {(x, y): 0 <x <δ1, 0 <y <δ2}. Next, we denote γ1 = {y = 0, 0 <x <δ1}, γ2 = {x = 0, 0 <y <Δ2}. In the area D, consider the system of the next type  2u ∂x∂y + a1 (x, y) rα ∂u ∂x + b1 (x, y) rα ∂u ∂y + c1 (x, y) rα + β u = f1 (x, y) rα + β, ∂u ∂x + a2 (x, y) xγ u = f2 (x, y) xγ, (1) where r 2 = x2 + y2, a1 (x, y), b1 (x, y), c1 (x, y), f1 (x, y), - specified functions in the area D, α> 2, β> 2, γ = 1 (α, β - whole positive numbers). Differential equations and redundant systems with regular, singular and super -sulfur coefficients were studied in work [1] [10]. In this note, based on the method of developed in [3], the presentation of the variety of solutions of the system of equations (1) is obtained using one arbitrary constant. Through C2 (D), we subsequently denote a class of functions that have continuous derivatives of the first order in D and such that ux y ∈C (D). So, the theorem is proven 1. Let the equations (1) α> 2, β> 2, γ = 1 (α, β are whole positive numbers) coefficients and right parts are proven in the following 218 “Lobachev Readings - 2019” to the conditions: 1) a1 (x, y) ∈C 1x (d), a2 (x, y), f2 (x, y) ∈C 1y (d), b1 (x, y), c2 (x, y), f1 (x , y) ∈C (D); 2) c1 (x, y) = r 2 ∂ ∂x (a1 (x, y) r) +a1 (x, y) b1 (x, y); 3) | A2 (x, y) −A2 (0.0) | ≤ h1rα1, h1 = const, α1> α−1, | b1 (x, y) −b1 (0.0) | ≤ h2rβ1, h2 = const, β1> β -1, | a2 (x, 0) −a2 (0.0) | ≤ h3xγ1, h3 = const, 0 <γ1 <1; 4) A1 (0.0) <0, B1 (0.0)> 0, A2 (0.0)> 0; 5) a) ∂ ∂x (a1 (x, y) rα) = ∂ ∂y (a2 (x, y) x) in d, b) ∂ ∂y (f2 (x, y) x) + a1 (x , y) f2 (x, y) xrα = (a2 (x, y) x - b1 (x, y) rβ) × × eXp [−W β B1 (x, y) −b1 (0.0) W (0.0) W (0.0) W (0.0) W (0.0) W (0.0) W (0.0) W (0.0) W (0.0) W (0.0) W (0.0) 2) β 2 −1 (x, y)] 1 (y)+∫ x 0 f1 (t, y) (t 2+y2) α+β 2 × EXP [W β B1 (T, Y) +B1 (0.0) W (2) β 2 −1 (t, y)] d t) +f1 (x, y) rα +β in D; 6) We require the existence of limits of lim x → 0 a2 (x, y) x = a12 (y), limx → 0 f2 (x, y) x = f 12 (y); 7) f1 (x, y) = o (r ν), ν> α+β -1.

The resulting decision has a property 10. If y → 0 lim y → 0 u (x, y) = ng (x). 20. If y → 0 and x → 0, then lim x → 0 {lim y → 0 u (x, y)} = lim x → 0 ng (x) = o (x - a2 (0.0)). 30.

Based on the obtained integral presentation of decisions, the following problem with the initial data was set and solved. The task is K1. It is required to find a solution to the system of equations (1) from class C2 (D) according to the initial condition LIM X → 0 {XA2 (0.0) Lim Y → 0 U (X, Y)} = P1, where P1 is a given constant. So, the following theorem theorem 2. Let all the conditions of theorem 1. Then the only solution, the problem K1 is expressed by formulas (2), (3), (4), where C1 = P1. 220 "Lobachev readings - 2019" Literature 1. Wilczynski E.J.
