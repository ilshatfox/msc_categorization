The parabolic fabrics of the ox with the tensor of curvature of the minimum rank are classified by the eight -dimensional fabrics of the pain with the tensor of curvature of the minimum rank, i.e.. With such a teenzo rum, which in a suitable basis has only two non -zero components. In /lj, fabrics of this type are divided into two types, NRI than with CKANNMI NE. The equations of .1 · Iperbolic tissue of her of the first type (roots of characteristic1 · 0 equations are not SCHSNNESS and various), and it is shown that their structure 01.1RS is judged by some permitted four -dimensional algebra Lee. M. N. A! ITIPOL 9 CO this work found the final equations and the geometric properties of the para. The workers of the first type of pain are described. (The roots of a characteristic equation coincide). To Ka. Zava Theorem. There is an ODPOPPA. LTERPROPICIAL SS.Mastao Zh.M.lteri: R 11.
