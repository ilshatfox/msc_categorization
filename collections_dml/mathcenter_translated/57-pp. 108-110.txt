UDC 517.956.6 The task with the conditions of frequency for the equation with the operator of Lavrentiev - Bitsadze with two lines of change of type in the rectangular region A.A. Gimaltdinova1 1 AA-gimaltDinova@mail.ru; The Ufa State Oil Technical University for the equation of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type with two perpendicular lines of type change in the rectangular region studied a non-puncture task with frequency conditions. The allegations of the uniqueness and the existence of its decision have been proved. A.A. Gimaltdinova 109 Keywords: a mixed equation, a non -bore task, periodicity conditions, unity and existence of a solution. For the equation lu ≡ (sgn x) uxx + (sgn y) uy y + bu = 0, b ∈ R, (1) in the rectangular area d = {(x, y) ∈ R2 | - l <x <h, - −α <y <β}, α, β, l, h ∈ R+, the following non -kaulal task has been studied. Task. Find the function u (x, y) that satisfies the conditions: u (x, y) ∈ C (D) ∩c1 (D) ∩c2 (D1 ∪D2 ∪D3 ∪D4), lu (x, y) ≡ 0, ( x, y) ∈ D1 ∪d2 ∪d3 ∪d4, u (x, y) ∣∣ x = h = u (x, y) ∣∣ x = −l, ux (x, y) ∣∣ x = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = h = ux (x, y) ∣∣ x = −l, y ∈ [−α, β], u (x, y) ∣∣ y = β = onic (x), u (x, y) ∣∣ y = - - - α = ψ (x), x ∈ [--l, h], where wor and ψ are the set sufficiently smooth functions, di - the same area D in the corresponding quarters of the Xoy plane. Previously, for equation (1) for b = 0, the first regional task was studied [1]. The solution to the problem was built in the form of a number of a number of bi -united systems of the corresponding spectral problem for an ordinary differential operator with a breakdown coefficient. The uniqueness of the solution is proved on the basis of the completeness of the bi -ore system in the space of L2 [—L, h]. In case of proof of the existence of a decision, i.e. When justifying the convergence of a series, the problem of small denominators arose. In this regard, estimates were obtained about the separation of small denominators from zero with the corresponding asymptotic, which allowed to prove the existence of a solution to the problem. In [2], the task is considered for l = h. The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFI-RB (project 17-41 020516). Literature 1. Gimaltdinova A.A.
