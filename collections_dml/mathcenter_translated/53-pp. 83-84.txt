Some ratios for the logarithmic block of compression. The relationship of the completeness of the exhibiting system with the behavior of integers of the exponential type, which turns into zero on the sequence of indicators of the specified system, is a well-known fact. So, for example, the work [1], [2] show that the criterion of completeness in an unlimited convex of the loy area of ​​a special type can be given in terms of such a characteristic of the sequence of zeros λ = {λn} n> 1 as the upper logarithmic density l̄ (λ. ) (in the distance for brevity-the logarithmic block-density): L̄ (λ): = Lim a →+ger Lim T →+ger 1 ln a ∑ t <λn6at 1 λn. (1) In connection with the foregoing, we believe that obtaining any ratios for the value of L̄ (λ) will be useful for the best results in the mentioned issues of completeness. We will consider the positively non -flowing after the milking of material numbers with the only maximum point +∞. By λn, n> 1 we mean the numbering of this sequence without taking into account multiples. We will denote the multiplicity of the point λn through νn, and then the very multiple of the following {λn, νn} n> 1 denote the letter λ. According to Lemm 3.2 of the work [1], the limit of A (1) is always related, so the value of L̄ (λ) is determined correctly. We also need to enter the following values ​​into consideration: η (λ): = lim n → φ λn+1 λn, (2) 84 A.F. Kuzhaev, A. I. Rafikov σ (λ): = lim n → و νn λn, σ̄ (λ): = lim n → ¾ νn λn. It is clear that η (λ)> 1. We will assume that everywhere in the long -term sheet, if the nasty is not stipulated, for the λ, the value (1) is considered after the pre -finishment. If σ (λ) = σ̄ (λ), then instead of σ (λ) and σ̄ (λ) we will write simply σ (λ). Theorem. Let σ (λ)> 0 and η (λ) 6 = 1. Then the assessment σ (λ) ln η (λ) 6 l̄ (λ) 6 σ̄ (λ) ln η (λ) is fair. Consequence. Let there be a value σ (λ), and simultaneously σ (λ) 6 = 0 and η (λ) 6 = 1. Then the formula l̄ (λ) = σ (λ) ln η (λ) is fair. L and T R A T R A 1. Malliavinp., Rubel L.A.
