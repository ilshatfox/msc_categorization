Rodionov2 1 valery_zakharov@list.ru; Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosova 2 rodionovtv@mail.ru; Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov proposed a criterion of the compactness of the compactness of the positive limited Radonovsky of the Natikhonovsky space, dating back to the criteria for the Polish space. For the general Hausdorf space, where the spaceCB space of limited continuous functions can be trivial and not to separate points and isolation, a criterion of S-S-compactness is proposed, where S is a uniformly closed linear space of metapolunetous functions. These results are significantly based on the solution to the problem of the Rice -Radon -Freche of the description of the Radon integrals as linear functionals received by the authors earlier. Keywords: Radonov measure, Prokhorov's property, uniform narrowness, weak compactness, rice theorem about the presentation. The famous criterion of Yu. V. Prokhorov (1956) claims that for the weak compactness of a closed set of limited radon measures in a complete separatic metric space (T, G) relatively weak topology generated in the RMB ≡RMB (T, G) limited radonical measures family CB ≡CB (t, g) of limited continuous functions, the fulfillment of two conditions is also necessary: ​​152 Materials of the School-Conference (απ) for any ε> 0 there is such a compact set of C that | µ | (t \ c) <ε for all µ ∈ M (uniform narrowness); (β) SUP (| µ | t | µ ∈ M) ∈ [0, urb). These conditions are sufficient for weak compactness in the Tikhonovsky (quite reed) topological space [2, IX.5.5]. However, they will not be necessary even in case of positive measures [3, 4.5.3, 4.5.4]. In the case of the general Hausdorfov (i.e., separated) the topological space (t, g) with ensembles G and F open and, accordingly, closed sets, it makes no sense to consider CB-ISTO compactness, due to the possible triviality of the CB family: it may consist of only Only constant functions. Therefore, V.K. Zakharov examined in [4] the weak compactness of the linear space s ≡ s (t, g) of symmetrisaled (metapolunetous) functions, which is an uniform closure of the linear space of the linear space SC U B +SC LB, consisting of F +G of limited functions, semi jerks from above and, accordingly, semi -intake from below. The following theorems give a description of the S. Theorem 1. Let (t, g) - topological space and k ≡ {g ∩ f | G ∈ G&F ∈F} - an ensemble of symmetrisaled sets. Function F: T → R is a symmetrized leopard, when for any ε> 0 there is a time final coating (ki ∈ K | i ∈ I) of the set T, that ω (f, ki) ≡ SUP {| f (t) - f (s) | | t, s ∈ Ki} <ε for any i ∈ I. Theorem 2. Let (t, g) - topological space. Then the family of S is a linear subspace of the linear space F of all functions F: t → R, closed relative to multiplication, module, finite Supremum and infimum, uniform convergence of sequences and division into functions separated by a constant from zero. Thus, S is the narrowest subfamily in F, containing the CB family and the characteristic functions χ (G) and χ (f) for all g ∈ G and F ∈ F and the properties listed in theorem 2. Say that the orientation (µn ∈RMB | n ∈ N) S-S-SBO to the measure µ is converged if lim (∫ f dµn) (n ∈ N) = ∫ f Dµ for any F ∈ S. Theorem 3. (1) Let (T, G)- Hausdorfovo space. Then the S-S-Sabba Topology on RMB is Khausdorfova. (2) Let (t, g) - Tikhonov’s space. Then C-Slaba Topology on RMB is Khausdorfova. The proof of statement (2) is much more subtle than the proof of the statement (1). Since we did not find it in the sources available to us, we were forced to prove it ourselves. Note that the proof of the statement (1) presented in [2, IX.5.3] applies not to the Radon measures as the functions of the sets, but “measures” in the sense of N. Burbaka. VK. Zakharov, T.V. Rodionov 153 S-S-S-S-TOPOLOGY on RMB is stronger than the CB-cube of topology, but strictly weaker than the trivial topology of convergence on the Borelev sets used in [3, 5.6.14]. Replacing the condition (απ) with a more stringent condition of locally uniform narrowness (αζ) for any g ∈ G and any ε> 0 there is such a compact subset C ⊂g, that | µ | (g \ c) <ε for all µ ∈ M, we get it The next criterion. Theorem 4. Let (t, g) - Hausdorfovo space and m ⊂ (rmb)+. Cl M set M sets in s-I-s-topology is S-S-Ibo compact tog
