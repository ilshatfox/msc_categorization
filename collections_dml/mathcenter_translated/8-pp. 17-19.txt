) The general projection method of solving the singular integro-radio equation is considered the syllabular integro-radio-differential equalization aung ≡ ′ (t)+a (t) С (t)+λ π +1 −1 h (t, τ) τ- t dτ = f (t), −1 <t <1, (1) under the initial condition gment (−1) = 0; (2) here a (t) ∈C [−1; 1], f (t) ∈L2 [-1; 1] ≡y, h (t, τ) ∈ C ([−1, 1] 2) are given functions, λ is an arbitrary parameter, and ∗ (u) -the desired function from the space of Sobolev 0 w 12 [−1, 1] ≡ x with the norm ‖ (t) ‖x = ‖ware ′ (t) ‖y, ship x, where l2 [-1; 1]-swag The space of quadratically summarized functions with the usual norm. The general projection method of solving the problem (1) - (2) is proposed and its theoretical justification is established in the sense of Ch. 14 [1] and ch. 12]. According to this method, the approximate solution is searched in the form of a polynomial wor (t) = n - 1∑ k = 0 αk accord (t), (3) which is determined as the solution of the next operator equation angno ≡ pnaphous ≡ pnf, gment (−1) = 0, (4) where PN is the linear polynomial projection operator of the rank nhern and with the norm ‖pn‖ → y = o (1), n ​​→ ∞. Note that equation (4) is equivalent to a system of (n+1) linear algebraic equations relative to unknown coefficients α0, α1 ,. . . , αn Polynoma (3). For a computing scheme (1) - (4) the following statements are true. Theorem 1. Let the task (1) - (2) has the only solution onic ∗ ∈ X for any right side F ∈Y. Then the equation (4) has the only solution onic (t) for any λ ∈R and at least with large navys. The approximate solution (3) at n → ∞ converges to the exact solution onic ∗ (t) in the space X with a speed of ‖ vents ∗ - onic‖x = o {en (d accord) y}, (5) where En (G. ) Y - the best average approximate approximation of the function g (t) ∈ L2 [−1, 1] with algebraic polynomials of the degree not higher than n. Theorem 2. Let material functions A (t) 6 = 0 and h (t, τ) = h (τ, t), and PN - ORTOGONAL design operator. Then the approval is fair: 1) the task (1) - (2) has the only solution for any material λ and the material right part F ∈Y; 2) for any natural n equation (4) has the only solution onic (t); 3) an approximate solution (3) converges to the exact solution of the problem (1) - (2) with speed (5).
