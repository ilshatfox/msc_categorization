A mixed non -stationary task for the function of electric field strength in the study of electromagnetic phenomena in the atmosphere is often used by Maxwell’s equations in quasi -stance electric approximation [1, 2]. However, this approximation describes slow processes in the atmosphere well. When describing fast processes, for example, thunderclasses, it is necessary to consider the full system of Maxwell’s equations. 52 In this work, the system of equations of the maxwell of the species of the type ROT ~ h (x, t) = 4π C (σ (x, t) ~ e (x, t) + ~ j st (x, t)) + 1 c ∂ ~ e (x, t) was studied (x, t) ∂t, (1) rot ~ e = −1 c ∂ ~ h (x, t) ∂t (2) in the area ω, dipho -nomorphic ball layer in R3, with the border ∂ω = γ1 ⋃ γ2 ( Γ1, γ2 - two components of the coherence of the border, each of which is dipho -nomorphic to the sphere in R3), t ∈ [0, T]. B (1) - (2) The assumption is taken into account that the magnetic and dielectric permeability satisfy the condition µ (x, t) = ε (x, t) = 1. System (1) - (2) is supplemented by the boundary condition of ~ eτ ∣∣∣ ∂ω = 0 (3) and the initial conditions ~ e ∣∣∣ t = 0 = ~ e0, ~ h ∣∣∣ t = 0 = ~ h0. (4) In the subject of the task (1) - (4) it was supposed to: σ (x, t) - the function of class C1 ([0, t]; lip (ω)), satisfying the condition 0 <σ ∗ 6 σ (x , t) 6 σ ∗, ~ j st (x, t) - a given class function {c1 ([0, t]; l2 (ω))} 3. When studying atmospheric phenomena, the main interest is the electrical field ~ e (x, t). To find the electric field from (1) - (2), the equation 1 C2 ∂2 ∂2 ∂2 ∂T2 + 4π C2 ∂ ∂t (σ (x, t) ~ e (x, t) + + can be obtained. ~ JST (x, t) + + ROT ROT ~ E (X, T) = 0. 53 The generalized setting of the problem is formulated in the work, the possibility of applying the Galerkin method to it is justified [3], with which the existence of the existence and uniformity of the solution is proved In functional spaces determined by the setting of the task. The issues of a numerical implementation of the solution of a mixed problem within the framework of the finite elements method are considered [3, 4].
