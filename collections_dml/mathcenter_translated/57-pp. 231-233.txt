Lomonosov, Laboratory of Infinite Analysis and Mathematical Physics of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics In this article, using a generalized integral inequaliMankovsky, a new property has been found that the systems of orthonomated functions possess. This property is illustrated by informative examples. The connection of the property under consideration with the spectral theory of linear operators was also discussed. Keywords: a function with a compact medium, Lyandra polynoma, the task of the LiUville assault. It is well known that various kinds of inequalities played and continue to play a significant role in mathematics (see [1] and links there). Significantly expands the use of inequalities in functional analysis The following theorem. Let xn (x), n = 1.2 ,. . . - a system of functions orthonomated on a segment [a, b], and let CN> 0 - elements of a converging numerical series with the sum of C = ∑mber = 1 Cn, then the following inequality is true: ∫ b a [و n = 1 cn | xn ( x) | ] 2 d x ≤c 2. (1) To prove this theorem, we take the function of the type: ω0 (y) = θ (y) θ (1- y) exp [ - 1 4 y (1– y)], (2) where θ (y) is a function Hevisaida [3]. This function has a compact medium: supp ω0 (y) = [0.1] and with the exact multiplier there is nothing more than the well -known function “hat” [3]: ω0 (y) ∼ω1/2 (y −1 /2). Further, we construct from function (2), constant CN and functions XN (X) the following function F (X, Y) of two variables: F (X, Y) ≡ n∑ n = 1 cn xn (x) ωn (y), (3) in which n is the natural number and ωn (y) = ω0 (y −n +1). The function (3) is continuous on the rectangle [a, b] × [0, n], therefore, with p> 1 on it for her justly generalized integral inequality of Minkovsky [2]: {∫ b a [∫ n 0 | f (x, y) | d y] p d x} 1 p ≤ ∫ n 0 [∫ b a | f (x, y) | p d x] 1 p d y. (4) 232 Materials of the School-Conference The result of the use of inequality (4) for P = 2 has the form: √ Cifta [n∑ n = 1 cn | xn (x) | ] 2 d x ≤ n∑ n = 1 cn. (5) When output formulas (5), both the orthonormation of the XN (X) function system and the compactness of the carriers of integer shifts of the function (2) were used. Finally, since the sequence of integrals in the right side of inequality (5) is a monotonously increasing sequence limited by Constanta C, then, directing N to infinity, we will receive the statement of the theorem. We illustrate the application of the proven theorem of a number of examples. Example 1. Let cn = 1/n2 and pn (x) - Lyandra polynomas [3]: pn (x) = 1 2n n! d n d xn (x2 −1) n, (6) then, according to the function proven above, the function (6) satisfy the inequality: ∫ +1 −1 [φ∑ n = 1 p 2n +1 n2 | pn (x) | ] 2 d x ≤ π 4 18. (7) Example 2. Let us consider on the segment [0.1] the next task of the Liwill assault: −d 2u (x) d x2 = λu (x), u (0) = 0, du (1) d x = u (1 ). (8) Own values ​​λn Tasks (8) are expressed through the roots µn of the transcendental equation: sinµ = µ cosµ (9) as follows: λn = µ2n, and n = 0 corresponds to the own value λ0 = 0, and the orthonomated own functions of the task (8) equal: x0 (x) = p 2 x, xn (x) = p 2 sin (µn x) | sinµn | , n ≥ 1. (10) Put cn = 1/µ2n, where µn is the positive roots of the equation (9), then due to the inequality (1): ∫ 1 0 [ger∑ n = 1 1 µ2n | sin (µn x) | | sinµn | ] 2 d x ≤ 1 2 (φ∑ n = 1 1 µ2n) 2. (11) For the exact assessment of the right part in the inequality (11), we will use the following known result (see [4], task 30.09): φ∑ n = 1 1 µ2n + z2 = tanh z z - tanh z - 3 z2. (12) Storming in identity (12) a variable z to zero, we find that ∑icles n = 1 1/µ 2 n = 1/5. I.A. Marouseev, A.E. Rassadin 233 Thus, for functions (10) with natural n, the inequality is fair: ∫ 1 0 [φ∑ n = 1 1 µ2n | sin (µn x) | | sinµn | ] 2 d x ≤ 1 50. (13) It is interesting to note that inequality (13) indicates the connection of the theorem proven above with the spectral theory of linear operators [5]. Obviously, inequalities (7) and (13) do not exhaust all the consequences of our theorem, therefore, the report shows other examples of the application of inequality (1). The prospect of this work is the distribution of the results obtained to the orthonomated functions determined in limited areas of RD spaces with dimensions D ≥ 2. In conclusion, it should be noted that the choice of the function of the type (2) for the design of auxiliary function (3) is not fundamental for evidence of the mentioned above Theorems, that is, other infinitely differentiated functions can be used as a function with a compact carrier, for example, the atomic function of the row-bacon UP (X), which subordinates the next linear functional-radical equation [6]: D UP (X) D X = 2UP (2UP (2UP x +1) −2up (2
