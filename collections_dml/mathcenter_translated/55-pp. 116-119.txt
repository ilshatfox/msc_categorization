UDC 519.688, 511.174 Silovsky subgroups of the AT-group A.V. Rozhkov1, M.V. Rozhkova2 1 ros.seminar@bk.ru; Kuban State University 2 ros.seminar@bk.ru; Krasnodar College of Management, Technology and Technology studies Silov’s subgroups of the AT-groups above the sequence of final cyclic groups. The issue was resolved from the Coer notebook. Keywords: group theory, computer algebra packages, Silovsky subgroups, groups of the group, not local finite periodical groups. The introduction of bernsidic groups is endless of course generated periodic groups. The first instrumentation of the group, given by the specified representation, and not by the contact, more precisely, implemented in the form of the final machine, is the design of S.V. Aleshin [1]. In [2], the design of Aleshin was generalized and introduced by the AT-group class (Aleshinsky Type Groups or, in a wider reading, Automorphisms of Trees Groups). Let A = (A1, A2,.) - the sequence of sets, each of which contains at least two elements. Kits U = (A1,., AN), AI ∈ AI, we will call the arreas of length n, | u | = n. We turn the set of all cules into a tree, connecting the vertex u = (a1,., An) and v = (a1,., An, an, an+1), n ​​∈N. The endless motorcade is γ = (a1, a2, ..., an, ...) by the way in the tree t. The tree t is clearly shown in the figure:; ✟ ✟ ✟ ✟ � �. . . ❍ ❍ ❍ ❍ ✟ ✟ ✟ � � ❍ ❍ ❍ ❍. . . . . . . . . ∈ A1 ∈ A2 T =. Any autorphism F wood, fixing the initial peak, is unambiguously set by a set of rearrangements of the ribs t, placed in its peaks: f = {f (u) | u ∈ T}, where f (u) is a rearrangement of the set A | u | +1, placed in A.V. Rozhkov, M.V. Rozhkova 117 vertex u. The permutation f (u) will be called Ue, and if only the length n of the u peak u, then the n-th accompanying rearrangement of automorphism f. Definition. Automorphism F wood is called root if f (;) is the only non -identifying accompanying rearrangement of automorphism f. Let the γ - a one -nuclear path in the tree t. Automorphism f of wood is called longitudinal, with the guide by γ, if from f (u) ̸ = 1 it follows that u = (γ1γ2.. .Mb an+1), for some n ∈ N and an+1 ∈ An+1 , moreover, an+1 ̸ = γn+1. Determination of AT groups. Let F - some of the root and longitudinal automorphisms of the tree t. The G = G R (F) group is called the AT -group over the sequence A if a group of permutations is πn = g r (f (u) | f ∈ F, | u | = n) is transit on the many an+1 for any n ∈N. It should be noted that any AT -group is endless and has a trivial center [2]. Let g -AT -group above the tree t. Let further, u ∈ T, | u | = N, - the top and stg (u) - the stabilizer of the vertex U GroupG. Then the narrowing of the stg (u) on the support of Tu with the initial vertex U is also an AT group, but above the sequence A (n) = (an+1, an+2, ...), and its generative many will be “tails” longitudinal generating groups. We will call this group N-cutting and denote. The most important case of AT groups, the most affordable proceedings, are regular AT groups. Definition. If the sequence A = (A1, A2,.) Consists of groups, and all accompanying permutations F (U) are elements of the regular representation of the corresponding groups of an, a total AT group we will call regular. The most important and most studied subclass of regular AT groups is the class of Atω groups. Determination. Let the pan = (p1, p2, ...) -a sequence of simple numbers, then a regular AT -group above the sequence of cyclic groups A = (AP1, AP2, ...) is called atω -group. Regular AT groups over the sequence of final cyclic groups should be noted that until now, in any periodic AT group that is not a P -group, Silovsky subgroups have been found. There were serious suspicions that in the class of periodic Atω-group over a limited but not constant sequence ω, all Silovsky subgroups were locally finite. Therefore, in [3] the question was raised about the Silovsky subgroups in the more class of the AT groups. Question 16.79. Is it true that in any of the certainly generated AT group above the sequence of cyclic groups, the orders of which are limited, all Silovsky subgroups are locally finite? However, the class of final cyclic groups from cyclic groups of simple order is very different. It is fundamentally important that a cyclic group of simple order is generated by any united element and this changes a lot. For example, in the case of a sequence of final cyclic groups, there is a regular AT -group G, which contains a subgroup F, which is 118 material
