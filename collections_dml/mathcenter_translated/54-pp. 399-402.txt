Chistyakov2 1 Schistyakova@hse.ru; National Research University "Higher School of Economics" - Nizhny Novgorod 2 vchistyakov@hse.ru; National Research University "Higher School of Economics" - Nizhny Novgorod for a segment I = [a, b] and metric space (M, D) on the set of M I acting from I to M, the pseudometric {νn}, called jointly, is determined by the sequence of the sequence Variation module. It is shown that if the two sequences of functions {f j} and {g j} of m i are such that {f j} is compactly compact to I, {g j}, which is accepted on I and limsup J → و (f j, g) = o (n ) Pron → ∞, then {f j} contains a total converging on I subsequence, the limit of which is a conditionally regular function. Keywords: metric space, joint variation module, fitness, the principle of choice, regular function, generalized variation. The classic result of the theory of the functions of the material variable is the following principle of choosing E. Helli (1912): evenly limited sequence of material non -flowing functions on the segment [a, b] of the material line R contains an intended subsequence. This theorem was summarized in various directions (mainly for the functions of limited and generalized limited variation) in the work [2, 8, 10–13], etc. The purpose of this work is to present a new sufficient condition (replacing the limitations of generalized variations) for the existence of a preoccupation Undergoing in the context of the space m i functions of the form F: I = [A, B] → M, where M is the metric space with metric D. This condition is based on the concept of a joint module of the variation of two functions f, g ∈ M I, developing the concept of a variation module (= modulus) of one function [1] (also [3–5]). Joint increment of two functions f, g ∈ M I on a two -point set {s, t} ⊂ i is called (always final) value ([6]) | (f, g) ({s, t}) | = SUP Zorn ∣∣D (F (S), Z)+D (G (T), Z) - D (F (T), Z) - D (G (S), Z) ∣∣. If n ∈ N and {II} Ni = 1 - a set of n two -point sets II = {Si, Ti} ⊂ I, then for brevity we write {II} ni = 1 ≺ i, if s1 <t1 ≤ s2 · · · · · · · ≤ sn -1 <tn -1 ≤ sn <tn (so the segments [s1, t1],., [Sn, tn] do not lean on each other). The set {II} ni = 1 ≺ i is called the breakdown of the segment I if t0: = s1 and si = ti - 1 for all I = 1,. . . , n, which is indicated through {ti} ni = 0 ≺ i. The joint module of the variations of two functions f, g ∈ M I is the following 400 materials of the International School-Conference Telness {νn (f, g)} mmn = 1 ⊂ [0, urb], determined for all n ∈N ([6]) : νn (f, g) = sup {n∑ i = 1 | (f, g) (II) | : {II} ni = 1 ≺ i}. With each n ∈ N, the function νn is (expanded) pseudometric on M I, i.e. νn (f, f) = 0, νn (f, g) = νn (g, f) and νn (f, g) ≤ νn (f, h)+νn (h, g) for all f, g, h, h ∈ M I. In addition, for all f, g ∈ M i, the sequence {νn (f, g)} و = 1 does not decrease, ν1 (f, g) ≤ νn (f, g) ≤ n1 (f, g) and νn+m (f, g) ≤ νn (f, g) + νm (f, g) for all n, m ∈ N. Thus, if ν1 (f, g) of course (for example, when f and g are limited), then exists limn → φνn (f, g)/n ∈ [0, urb). For a sequence of functions {f j} ≡ {f j} φj = 1 ⊂ m i and f ∈ M i, we denote through f j → f to the i -processing {f j} to f, i.e. lim j → φ (f j (t), f (t)) = 0 ∀ t ∈ I, and through f j â F to I uniform convergence {f j} to f, i.e. lim j → φdurb (f j, f) = 0, where (expanded) uniform metric Dun on m i is set by the rule durb (f, g) = suptussi d (f (t), g (t)). If now n ∈N, F, G ∈ M I and {F J}, {G J} ⊂ M I is such that f j → f and g J → G (corresponding to f j â f and g y y) on I, then νn (f, g) ≤ liminf j → φνn (f j, g j) (corresponding to. νn (f, g) = lim j → inous (f j, g j)). The main result of the work is the next premise principle of choice [6, Theorem 1] (recording of the type ofµn = o (n) in it means, as usual, that limn → φµn/n = 0): theorem 1. Let two sequences of functions {f j} , {g j} ⊂ m i - that (a) with any t ∈ I close in M ​​set {f j (t): j ∈N} compact; (b) g J → G on I for some function g ∈ M I; (c) µn: = limsup j → φνn (f j, g j) = o (n). Then {f j} contains an undergoing, which is appropriately converged on I to some function F ∈ M i such that νn (f, g) ≤µn for all n ∈N. Here are some comments and investigations. Everywhere below symbol C means any constant function C: I → M. 1. Condition (c) in theorem 1 is not necessary in the case of the current sequences {f j} and {g j}, but it is necessary for uniformly converging sequences: indeed, if f j â F and g y â g on I, and νn ( f, g) = o (n), then lim j → φνn (f j, g j) = νn (f, g) = o (n). Condition (c) in theorem 1 is not invariant regarding equivalent (in the topological sense) metrics D on m; Moreover, it may not take place
