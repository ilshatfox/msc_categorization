) Iliterative methods of gradient type for finding quasi -free nonlinear operator equations are considered the equation f (x) = 0, where f: h1 → h2 is a non -lineociated operator, H1, H2 - the Gilberta space. In cases where the resolution of the original equation is not guaranteed, the task of finding its quasi -playing is set, i.e., points X ∗, which delivers a minimum to H1, the functionality of the miserable ffic (x) = 12‖f (x) ‖2. We believe that instead of the exact operator f (x), only its approximation f̃: h1 → h2, which has in the vicinity of ωr points x ∗ about 133 gato gato up to a third order and satisfying the conditions ‖f̃ (x) - f (x) ‖ ≤ δ, ‖f̃ ′ (x) - f ′ (x) ‖ ≤ δ, ‖f̃ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ‖ ≤ δ ∀x ∈ ωr, where δ is a known level of error in the task of the operator f (x). The iteration process of the approximation of the quasi of the quasi x ∗ x0 ∈ H1, XN + 1 = PM (xn - ctor - γf̃ ising (xn) (xn) (xn)) + ctor, (1) where PM is the design operator for fixed closed subspace M ⊂ H1 . The parameter ă h1 satisfies the condition ‖ (pm - e) (x ∗ - perf) ‖ ≤ ∆. Theorem. Let the initial approximation X0 is closely close to quasi of the X ∗ of the initial equation, error Δ, ∆ is quite small. Then, with suitable constants C, l> 0, q ∈ (0, 1), for the sequence {xn}, the ratios are performed ‖xn - x ‖ ≤ lqn + c (δ + ∆) + ∆, lim n → nder ‖xn - x ∗ ‖ ≤ c (δ + ∆) + ∆. (2) According to (2), produced by the method (1) approaches {xn} are stabilized at N → urb in the vicinity of quasi -rejection x ∗ radius C (δ + ∆). Thus, the problem of the practical implementation of the scheme (1) removes the problem of choosing the moment of stopping iterations. A similar (1) process in relation to the case f (x ∗) = 0 was studied earlier in [1]. L and T R A TARARO. Bakushinsky A. B.
