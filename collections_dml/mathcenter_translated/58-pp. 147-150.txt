Mingaleeva2 1 svpn.1402@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 minga.mba.m@gmail.com; The Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the article provides a pair of spaces, which are in a sense of narrowing of the spaces of continuous functions, in which the problem of solving the symbolic integral-reduced equation of the first kind on the segment of the material axis is correctly set correctly. The unambiguous resolution of the computing diagrams of the method of moments and the method of collocation and the convergence of these methods in the selected space, and, as a result, uniform convergence, have been established. Keywords: integro-differential singular equation, correctness of the task, unambiguous solidity, consipligration of the approximative method Consider the singular integro-radio-radio equation (S.I.D.) of the type K x ≡ 1 π 1∫ —1 x ′ (τ) t −τdτ+ 1 π 1∫ −1 h (t; τ) x (τ) dτ = y (t), −1 <t <1, (1) where x (τ) - desired, y (t) and h. (t, τ) - known functions, under the regional conditions x (−1) = x (1) = 0, (2) a the singular integral iphous (onic; t) = 1 π 1∫ −1 onic (t) t −τdτ is understood in the sense of the main value of Koshi. According to the classical theory, such equations relate to incorrectly on the tasks, and incorrectness may be associated with the united solution, its absence or instability. This means that to solve this problem you can not use conventional approximate methods. However, the latest studies conducted at Kazan University ([1], [2], [3]) revealed that in some cases, the correct setting of the problem of solving equation (1) can be distinguished with the subsequent application of approximative methods of the solution. In this article, equation (1) is considered on a pair of spaces (x, y). 148 “Lobachev Readings - 2019”, we denote through the 10th space the functions of X (T) that satisfy the condition (2), such that ρi x ′ is a continuous function, are continuously differentiated on [-1, 1]. The norm is determined as follows || x || x = || ρx ′ || C +|| ρi x ′ || C. Here || x || C = max - 1≤t≤1 | x (t) |, ρ (t) = √ 1 - t 2. As a space of right parts, we choose the space of continuous functions y (t) such as I (ρY) is also a continuous function, with the norm || y || y = || ρy || C +|| I (ρy) || C. The correctness of the task is established on this pair of spaces. For this, the equations are built computational schemes of the method of moments and the collocation method. Method of moments. The approximate solution of equation (1) is searched in the form of xn (t) = √ 1 - t 2 n∑ k = 1 γkuk - 1 (t) = n∑ k = 1 γk sink arccos t, (3) where uk -1 (t ) - Polynomas of the Chebyshev II of the II. Applying the condition of equality zero n M moments of the wire of the II of the II genus, we find unknown coefficients γk, k = 1, n from the system of linear algebraic equations (SLAU) (J +1) γ J +1 +n∑ k = 1 γkβk J = y j, j = 0, n −1, (4) where βk j = 2 π2 1∫ −1 1∫ —1 √ 1–τ2 √ 1 - t 2h (t; τ) uk - 1 (τ) u j (t) dτd t, y j = 2 π 1∫ −1 √ 1 - t 2y (t) u j (t) d t. Collocation method. A close solution is sought in the same way as in the method of moments, in the form (3). Applying the condition of equality zero inhumines in the nodes of collocation, which are the roots of the Polynoma of the Chebyshev Ith, we will find unknown coefficients γk, k = 1, n from the sludge n∑ k = 1 γk [kuk-1 (t j)+ 1 π 1∫ −1 √ 1–τ2q (t j; τ) uk - 1 (τ) dτ] = y (t j), j = 0, n −1, (5) t j = cos 2 j +1 2n π, j = 0, n — N ​​— N one. S.V. Panina, L.Ch. Mingaleeva 149 through W R H; we will denote many functions that have a continuous derivative of the RB order that satisfies the condition of the Helder with the indicator α, 0 <α ≤ 1, R ≥ 0. The theorem is established. Let the conditions are fulfilled: 1) the function y ∈ W R H; the nucleus h (t; τ) ∈ W R H; according to the variable t, it is evenly related τ, 0 <α ≤ 1, r ≥ 0; 2) S.I.D. (1) is unambiguously permitted in space X with any right side Y from Y. Then, starting with some n ∈ N, Slau (4), (5) have the only solution {γ ∗ k}, k = 1, n. Approximate solutions x ∗ n (t) = √ 1 - t 2 n∑ k = 1 γ ∗ kuk - 1 (t) converge to the exact x ∗ (t) in space x with speed || x ∗ n −x ∗ || X = o (l n nr+α), 0 <α≤ 1, r ≥ 0. The consequence. In the conditions of the theorem, there will be a uniform convergence of close decisions to the accurate with speed || x ∗ n −x ∗ || C = o (lnn nr+α), 0 <α≤ 1, r ≥ 0. || ρ (x ∗ N ′ −x ∗ ′) || C = O (lnn nr+α), 0 <α≤ 1, R ≥ 0.
