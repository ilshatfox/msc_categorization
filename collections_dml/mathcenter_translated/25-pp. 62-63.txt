Mathematical modeling of the mechanical system "Pipeline -Summary of the pressure" considers mathematical models of the mechanical SIS of the theme "Pipeline - pressure sensor". As an example, we give one of them. In a linear production corresponding to the small deflection of the elastic element and small indignations of the velocity of the working environment, the mathematical model is determined by the next equations and boundary conditions: <fjxx + <{jyy = o, (x, y): o < + oo, 1u11u1 <UO/2; <ru (x, Â± UO/2, t) = o, x e (o, +oo); Chjx (o, y, t) = o, y (-wo/2, a) u (b, UO/2); 62 IPX (X, YO, T) = W (Y, T), U E (A, B). lim (R. -pipt (x, y, t)) = P (t), U E (-wo/2, UO/2); w ~ oo l (w) = mw + dw '"" + 6w "' 1 + {zw + 7w = RO (y, t) - R. + PIPT (O, U), E) (a, b). Here IP (x, y, t) - the potential of the speed of the working environment, W (y, t) deflection of the elastic element, UO - transverse size of the pipeline water, p (t) - the law of change in the working environment at the input to the pipeline, RO (U, T) - a distributed external load, and, b - the coordinates of the ends of the element, x, y - decartons coordinates, bar and point correspond to differentiation according to x and t.
