Balgimbaev1 1 Sholpan.Balgyn@gmail.com; The Institute of Mathematics and Mathematical Modeling (Almaty, Kazakhstan) establishes LP - the limit of one class of pseudo -diodecture operators with a symbol, insignificant in spatial variable, on D -derivatives of 1 <p <mm in the presence of weights. Keywords: pseudo -dysphenerated operator, operator symbol, d - dimert. Pseudo -radiographic operators (PDOs), i.e. Operators having a presentation TAU (x) = (2π) −d ∫ rd a (x, perf) û (hole) e2πi xisingunk are important in the theory of general differential operators with variable coefficients, as well as in harmonic analysis. A study of the limitations (classes) of PDOs between various normalized spaces of functions and distributions is one of the important tasks of the theory. It is usually assumed that the symbol A: RD × RD → C operator TA is smooth, both in spatial variable X and in the frequency variable ctor, and satisfies some growth conditions (descending). BEAN, Z, R, C - many natural, whole, real and complex numbers, respectively; N0 = n∪ {0}; R+ = (0,+ inous); ZD = {1.2 ,. . . , d} (d ∈ N). For Sh.A. Balgimbaeva 47 x = (X1,., XD), y = (y1,., Yd) ∈ RD put X y = x1y1 +. . .+ XD YD, | X | : = | x | 2 = p xx; x ≤ y (x <y) ⇔ xκ ≤ yeth (xκ <y) for all κ ∈ ZD. Next, td ≡ (r/z) d-d-dimensional torus. Let S (RD) and S ′ (RD) - the spaces of the Schwartz of test functions and distributions, respectively; F̂ ≡ fd (f) - the conversion of Fourier for f ∈ S ′ (RD). Further for α = (α1,., Αd), γ = (γ1,., Γd) ∈N0, we use standard multi -cynx designations: ∂α f (x) (≡ ∂αx f (x)) = ∂ ∂ ∂ α11 · · ∂ αd d f (x), where ∂κ = ∂∂xκ, κ ∈ ZD; | α | = α1 +. . .+αD, α! = α1! · · · ΑD!; (α γ) = α! γ! (α -γ)! (γ≤α). Let, further, s ′ (TD)-the space of 1-periodic (in all variable) distributions, i.e., the totality of all f ∈S how mail (RD) such as 〈f, ∗ (·+ă)〉 = 〈f , ∗〉 for all lus ∈S (RD) and any lection ∈Zd. It is known that F ∈S ′ (TD) if only if SUPP F̂ ⊂ ZD, i.e., distribution F̂ is converted to 0 on the open set RD \ ZD. For f ∈ L1 (RD) (⊂S ′ (RD)) and g ∈ L1 (td) (⊂s ′ (td)) we have f̂ (perf) = ∫ rd f (x) e -2πiunkd x, ₽ ∈Rd ; ĝ (cil) = ∫ td g (x) e -2πiunkd x, ăzd. We fix the vector D = (D1,., DN) ∈ NN, N ∈ N, N ≤ D. Then x = (x1,., XD) ∈ RD = RD1 · · · × RDN Imagine in the form of x = (X1,., XN), where xν = (xkν -1+1,... , xkν) ∈Rdν. Next, we denote Ka = D1 +. . . + dν, k0 = 0 and introduce the sets kaa = {l ∈N: kν -1 + 1 ≤ l ≤ kν}, ν ∈ Zn. We introduce the weight m = (m 1,., M n), where ma = (mkν -1+ 1,., Mk door) and minlornaν ml = 1. For yν ∈Rdν determine the action t ∈R+ by Yaν as follows T M ν yν = (t mkν -1+1 ymmaν -1+1,., t mkν ykν) and designate [yν] ν: = {t> 0: t --m ν yν = (t −1) mνyν ∈ {yν ∈Rdν: | yν | = 1}}. If x ∈RD, we put T M X = (T M 1 X1,., T M N XN). We denote the first order difference for the function f (x): r d → r by ν-th “pack” of the variable ∆νy f (x) = f (x1, xν-y,., Xn. ) - f (x), ν ∈ Zn, y ∈Rdν. We give a generalization of the determination of the continuity module definition. A set of functions {ω1 (t1), ω2 (t1, t2) ,. . . , ωn (t1,., tn)} we will call the continuity module if the conditions are fair: 1. For each ν ∈ Zn functions ων (t1,., tν): (r+) → R+ continuous, concave, concave, concave monotonously increasing for each variable TL, l ∈ Za; 48 Materials of the School-Conference 2. ων (T1,., Ta) is invariant regarding any rearrangement of variables T1 ,. . . , tave; 3. For each µ, ν: 1 ≤µ <ν≤ n ων (t1,., Tν) ≤ 2ν -µωµ (t1,., Tµ). Let the symbol a (x, lection) satisfy the conditions: I. For any ν ∈ Zn, l ∈ Kν and α ∈
