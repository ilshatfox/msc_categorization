. The use of obvious variable schemes in solving the problem of continuous smelting of steel 1 r.F. Kadyrov, A.V. Lapin Kazan State University, Kazan 1 Introduction The task of cooling the steel ingot in the process of continuous smelting is modeled by the task of Stefan with prescribed convection [1, 2]. The theorems of existence and uniqueness for such tasks are proved in [3]. With a numerical solution, completely implicit schemes or implicit schemes with approximation according to the characteristics of the transfer operator are traditionally used (see [4–6] and the bibliography of these works). These schemes are unconditionally stable, however, for their numerical implementation, iterative methods such as the upper relaxation method, which have a low 1 work, were performed with the support of the RFFI, project No. 01-01-00068 141 The use of obvious variable schemes. . . the speed of convergence. Acceleration of calculations is carried out by applying the methods of decomposition of the region [7.8] and/or multi -section procedures. As you know, obvious schemes with a constant step have only conditional stability, which significantly narrows their area of ​​application in solving applied problems. At the same time, in the works [9–11], effective algorithms are proposed based on obvious schemes with variable steps to solve both linear and nonlinear non -stationary problems. This note sets out the results of the application of obvious schemes with variable steps to the non -stationary non -linear task of continuous smelting of steel. 2 The setting of the regional task is ω ∈ R2 - a rectangle [0, lx] × [0, LY] with a rounded lower left angle, radius of rounding R> 0, ω = ω ∪ ∂ω. Let further v = ω × (0, lz) - a three -dimensional region with the border γ = ∂v, consisting of parts: γ0 = ω × {0}, γn = {(x, y) ∈ ∂ω: x = 0 ∨ y = 0} × (lm, lz] ∪ ω × {lz}, γs = {(x, y) ∈ ∂ω: x 6 = 0 ∧ y 6 = 0} × (0, lz], γm = {(x , y) ∈ ∂ω: x = 0 ∨ y = 0} × (0, lm], where 0 6 lm <lz.

Kadyrov, a In the subject of the application in the considered application, the region V is busy with a metal ingot (or melt), while ω is a quarter of the cross -section of the ingot, its length, while LM is the length of the primary cooling zone of the ingot. The temperature field of the ingot is subject to the determination. Passing for some time T> 0 from the moment the cooling starts. The temperature is t = t (x, y, z, t) is specified at each point (x, y, z) at any moment in time t ∈ [0, TF - time - time The end of the process of smelting). We determine the function of enthalpy h (t) and the temperature of the Kirchhof K (t) as follows: h (t) = ρ   t∫ 0 c (ă) dival + l (1– fs (t))                    , K (t) = t∫ 0 k ( cil) dă, where ρ, c (t), k (t) and l - density, heat capacity, thermal conductivity and hidden heat heat, fs (t) - liquid fraction for temperature t: fs (t) = {1, t> TS, 0, t <tl. Here TS - melting temperature, TL - crystallization temperature. The following drawings depict examples of graphs for the functions of enthalpy and the temperature of the Kirchhof. Note a monotonous continuous dependence = h (t), this also allows you to determine the reverse function t = t (h). 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 5.5 6.5 7.5 8 8.5 9.5 10 x 10 6 6 Enthalpy Temperature (C0) H (T) (K J/ M 3) 1100 1200 1300 1500 1600 35 40 45 50 55 60 KIRCHOFFM Transformation Temperature (C0) K (T) (K W /M) Fig. 2: Schedule H (t) Fig. 3: Graph of K (T) 143 The use of obvious variable schemes. . .
