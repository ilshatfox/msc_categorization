Based on these conditions, theorems of the existence and unity of the solution of the equation (1) are proved. II. The iterative method of finding the solution of equation (1) is proposed and its convergence is proved. III. The convergence is proved and effective evaluations of the errors of the abstract method of gallerkin solutions to equation (1) based on an arbitrary full system of functions in L2, ρ, and its specific implementations are considered. IV. The computing schemes of the quadrature method are offered and their justification is given on the basis of the theory of monotonous operators, while effective errors are obtained, taking into account the structural properties of the source data.
