Abed2 1 airat.bikchentaev@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 Samialbarkish@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University for normalized algebra and k ∈N are introduced and investigated ∥ · ∥-outdated classes PK (A) = {T ∈A: ∥T K+1 A∥ ≥ ∥t a∥k+1 for all a ∈ A C ∥A∥ = 1}. It is shown thatP1 (a) ⊂pk (a) for all k ∈N. If t ∈P1 (A), then t n ∈P1 (A) for all n ∈ N. If A is united, u, v ∈ A is that ∥u∥ = ∥v ∥ = 1, v u = i and t ∈ Pk (a), then u t v ∈ Pk (a) for all k ∈ N. In particular, if a isomal c ∗-algebra and t ∈Pk (a), tou ∗ ∈Pk (a) for all isometrics ∈A and k ∈N. Let A is toilet, then 1) if the element t ∈P1 (A) is turned on the right, then the right reverse element t −1 ∈P1 (A); 2) with ∥i∥ = 1 class P1 (A) consists of normal elements; 3) if the spectrum of the element t ∈P1 (A) lies on a single circle, then ∥T X ∥ = ∥X ∥ for all x ∈A.

The operator t ∈ B (h) is called paranormal if ∥t 2x∥h ≥ ∥t x∥2h for all x ∈H С ∥x∥h = 1, see [1] - [3]; isometry, if t ∗ t = i; Hyponormal if t ∗ t ≥ t t ∗. C ∗ -algebra is the complex banakh ∗-algebra is such that ∥x ∗ x ∥ = ∥x ∥2 for all x ∈ A. According to the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, any C ∗-albra can be realized as C ∗ -dalgebra in b (h) for some guilbert space h. Let A - normalized algebra above the field λ, a1 = {x ∈ A: ∥x ∥ = 1} and k ∈ N. Recall that t ∈A quasinilpotent, if ∥t n∥ 1n → 0 with n → ∞; Normalid, if ∥t n∥ = ∥t ∥n for all n ∈N.
