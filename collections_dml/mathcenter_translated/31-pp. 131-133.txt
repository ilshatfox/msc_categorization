. Some diversity of the algebrian Leibrus with whole exhibits S. M. Ratsev Ulyanovsk State University, www.ulsu.ru The characteristic of the main field is zero. In the recording of the elements, the brackets are lowered during their lefton -in -armed arrangement, that is, ABC = ((AB) C). Legebra Leibniz are determined by the identity (xy) z = (xz) y + x (YZ) and are generalizations of algebrus Lee. For arbitrary diversity V exponential growth of the dimensions of the PN (V), the concepts of the lower and upper exhibitors are introduced: EXP (V) = Lim N → least √ Dim Pn (V), EXP (V) = LIM N → ger N √ DIM PN (V). If these two numerical values ​​coincide, then it is EXP (V). 131 Let G - the endless algebra of the Grassman. Then, from the algebra G regarding the switching operation, we get the algebra Lee G ( -), and with the operation of zero multiplication we get Abeli ​​Algebra Lee G0. We define G̃ as a straight amount G̃ = G ( -) ⊕ G0 of vector spaces G ( -) and G0 with multiplication (G1 + G01) (G2 + G 0 2) = [G1, G2] + (G 0 1G2) 0. The resulting Algebra will be algebra Leibniz. Let ṽ2 = Var (G̃). It is known that ṽ2 has almost polynomial growth. Theorem 1. 1) ṽ2 is the smallest variety of algebrus Leibniz, in which no standard identity is performed. 2) the basis of identity ṽ2 are the identity of y1 (y2 (y3y4)) = 0 and z (xy) (xy) = 0. 3) diversity ṽ2 has an endless basic rank. Any own submarine in ṽ2 has a final base rank. 4) Codlin of diversity ṽ2 is almost final. We determine the diversity of the algebrian Leibniz ñSA as an identity (x1x2). . . (X2S+1x2S+2) = 0. For arbitrary variety V ⊆ ñsa, we introduce the following values: QN (i, v) = max {λi | λ `n, mλ (v)> 0}, p (v) = max {i | lim n → → qn (i, v) = +φ, i = 1 ,. . . , s}, where mλ is the degree of unprincipled representations of the SN group corresponding to the division λ of the number n. Theorem 2. Let V ⊆ ñSA and P (V) ≥ 1. Then the following inequalities will be performed for any n: n - p (v) qn (p (v), v) ≤ 2s + p (v) - 1, nβp (V) n ≤A DIM PN (v) ≤ anαp (V) N 132 for some A, α and β. Consequence. There are no submarines in ñsa, the growth of which would be intermediate between polynomial and exponential. Theorem 3. Let V ⊆ ñSA. Then 1) Exp (v) = p (v) ∈ {1,. . . , s}; 2) If EXP (V) = 1, then the DIM PN (V) sequence is limited by polynoma. The dynamic model of the geodetic tube in the metric of Schwarzshilda L. I. Rozakov Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University Gumlei@rambler.ru is one of the sections of Riman geometry, which can be considered in the theory of gravity as a dynamic theory of particle theory in gravitational fields determined by metric tenzor The four -dimensional Rimanov space with the Lorentsev signature (−1, −1, −1, +1). At the same time, the trajectories of massive trial particles correspond to the time -like geodesic, and the isotropic ones are of the Blessed. Exploring the geometry of geodetic lines, it is possible to restore local (and even global) geometry of space-time. The most complete study of the geometry of space-time is achieved by a study of the geometry of the geodetic tube, i.e., the conspiracy of close geodetic. The purpose of the work is the study of geometry geodetic 133
