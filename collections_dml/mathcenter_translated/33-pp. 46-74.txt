. Study of derivatives of speed and pressure functions for the task of non -stationary movement of the viscous weak -minded gas1 K. A. Zhukov, A. V. Popov Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, Moscow 1 initial-stringing task Consider the system of linear equations that describes the non-stationary movement of the viscous weak-lean barotropic gas: ∂p ∂t + k div u = g, ∂u ∂t + ∇p = µ∆u + f. (1.1) 1 work was carried out with the financial support of the RFFIF, project No. 02-0100490, and the programs of the Russian Academy of Sciences “Theoretical Problems of Modern Mathematics” (project “Optimization of computational algorithms for solving the problems of mathematical physics”) 46 K. A. Zhukov, A. V. Popov desired Values, pressure P and speed vector U = (U1, U2), are the functions of Eler's variables (t, x) ∈ Q = [0, T] × ω. Through µ indicates a dynamic viscosity coefficient, which is considered a well -known positive constant. In the future, we will assume that µ <1. The equation includes function F (vector of external forces), which is a known function of Euler variables. A positive constant characterizes the compressibility of gas [5, 10] is indicated through K. We will consider the gas to be ill -impermeable if K> 1. Complete the system (1.1) with the initial and boundary conditions (p, u) | t = 0 = (p0, u0), x ∈ ω, u (t, x) = 0, (t , x) ∈ [0, t] × ∂ω. (1.2) Below we will assume that there is the only classic solution to the problem (1.1), (1.2). In this work, the dependences of the temporary and spatial derivatives of the problem of the problem (1.1), (1.2) on the parameters of the problem K and µ. A priori assessments of functions (p, u) and their derivatives, depending on the values ​​of K and µ are required to assess the error of numerical methods for solving this problem [1,2]. The task (1.1), (1.2) is closely related to the non -stationary task of Stox and the tasks arising in solving the problems of Stox using disturbances due to the assumption of weak fluid compressibility. Therefore, the methods used in this work are based on the ideas of classical works [4, 6]. In the monograph [11], the solutions for the problem of the type of Stox were obtained, and in the article [9] - for the inpatient generalized problem of Stake, that is, in the case when the first equation has the form of Divu = G. In the work [8], the nature of the behavior of the solution of the problem λp+ divu = g, ∇p+ µarn = f was investigated. In [5, 10], the analogue of theorem 2.2, 2.3 of this article in a particular case has been proved. The expression (·, ·) denotes a scalar work in space L2 (ω), and ‖ ‖ ‖2 or ‖ · ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ нор нор нор is the norm in l2 (ω). Expression 47 Study of derivatives of speed and pressure functions. . . ‖ · ‖ (N) 2 denotes the norm in the spacewn2 (ω), and expression | · | (n) 2-midnight obtained by summing the L2-Norm of all private derivatives for variables X and Y of order n. Below we will also use the norm ‖u‖ - 1 = SUP eed ∇∇ ax. For a scalar work and norms of functions in the q region, we use the following designations: (u, v) q = t∫ 0 (u (t), v (t)) dt, ‖u‖ (n) φ, 2 = SUP 06T6T ‖U (t) ‖ (n) 2, ‖u °, −1 = sup 06t6t ‖u (t) ‖ - 1, ‖u‖ (n) 2.2 = √ Cap t) ‖ (n) 2) 2 dt, | u | (n) 2.2 = √ Cap (| u (t) | (n) 2 dt, ‖u‖2, - - - - - - - 1 = √ Earls t∫ 0 ‖u (t) ‖2−1 dt. The letters X and Y in the lower index in functions indicate private derivatives of functions by variable X and Y, respectively. This designation is stored when the function depends on one variable - it means an ordinary derivative of this variable. The private derivative of the functions U by a temporary variable will indicate the point: ∂u/∂t = u̇. The total number of points and indices X, Y will determine the order of a mixed derivative. We will use the ε-nevio AB 6 εA2 + 1 4ε B2. When using it, the letter ε or ε with the index will always be used. 48 K. A. Zhukov, A. V.
