Hyperperson in the projective-metric space D.A. Abrukov Chuvash State Pedagogical University named after AND I. Yakovleva, Cheboksary E-TAI/: Malinan@clmv.Sh.ru, the work examines the regular hyperpanne vn- \ [j 1, dive in the projective-metric space to "with the absolute QN-L [2]. Polar relative to the polar regarding Absolute QN-L Hyperperson VN-I. A connection has been obtained between polar normalizations in the sense of A. Norden of regular hyperfoons VP-I and V ,, _ 1. Double-free ones were found [ZJ images V ,, _ 1 in p, and v "_1 in ? "Hyperfonets VP-I and VN- \ in P, as well as the conditions of the degeneration of hyperpoles VN-1 and-2-Â· 2 VN-1 into hyperkvadriki QN-1 and QN-1. It has been proven that the normalization of regular hyperpoles VN-1 and V ,, _ 1 induces two pairs of dual affinity without torsion. Their internal geometry is studied. Literature 1.
