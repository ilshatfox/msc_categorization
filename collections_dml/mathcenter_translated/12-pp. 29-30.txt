. The direction of the initial growth of the crack from the top of the casp with a semi -infinite neckline V.V. Ermolaeva, L.V. Sinyushin for Aza certain states Enoye univa sit the task of finding the direction of the beginning: 1 growth of cracks from the top of the caspa is solved on the basis of the hypothesis: "The initial spread of the treshine occurs in the plane, for which normal tearing stresses IJ (3 have: .1Aximal value of the coefficient intensity "[1]. Thus, if Z0 is the top of the caspa, and a ::: = c (j) / ji z - zoi, z -+ z0, where / 3 = arg (z - z0), then for Determining the direction. in. 29 It is necessary to solve the equation:} {: rz) iz - zo lap} c = c. = O. In s'1uchas of the semi -nerd cut, the appearance of which is half a display of the upper half -fringed IM (> O using functions (2 (( + i (b2 + 1) / (b2 - 1)) 2, z (() = (( + i (b2-1) / (b2 + 1)) 2, o> 1, ish ( > Oh, for.: Pcqa definitions Rz. It comes down to solving the equation of the form A sin -o + in cos -u + s 3 -u + d cos 3 -o = f relative "'/, where a, c, c, s. , D, f are determined from the regional conjuring the first main task of the theory of elastic Sty [2]. For this, the chi is in the plane with the specified neckline an exact decision was obtained. Determination.'1iv from the equation /., Find / 3. = 2 ')' •. The task of determining the direction of crack growth is solved for the case of setting the boundary voltage in the form of W n - it = - ~ - - t e (-o +oo). W E (o 21r ·). T + I ''. '. And for the case of the application of concentrated force at one boundary point, which corresponds to the rupture of the first kind in the vector of boundary efforts. Literature 1. Panasyuk V.V.
