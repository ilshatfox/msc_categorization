Determining the comprehensive constant spread of cylindrical dielectric waves by the methods of potential theory in [1] is proposed a numerical method for finding material constant spread of β surface waves of cylindrical dielectric voluminous volumes with an arbitrary contour of cross -section. This task is (see e.g. [2]) in determining such values ​​of the β parameter in which there are non -trivial solutions of the Helmholtz equations ∆u+χ2ju = 0, ∆v+χ 2 jv = 0, m = (x, y) ∈ SJ, J = 1, 2; (1) satisfying the conditions of the conjugation of u+ - u - = 0, v+ - v - = 0, m ∈ C, 1 χ21 (βu - ∂τ - ωµ0 ∂v - ∂ν) - 1 ∂u+ ∂ττ - ωµ0 ∂V+ ∂ν) = 0, m ∈ C, (2) 1 χ21 (β ∂V - ∂τ+ ωε1 ∂U - ∂ν) - 1 χ22 (β ∂v+ ∂τ - ωε2 ∂u+ ∂ν) = 0, m ∈ C. Here χj = √ k20n 2 j - β2, k20 = ω2ε0µ0, εj = ε0nj, j = 1, ε1 <ε2, s1 - the area on the plane R 2, limited by the smooth contour 244 C, s2 = R 2 \ S̄1, U+ (U -) - the limit values ​​of the function u from the outside (from the inside) of the circuit C. This work is devoted to the determination of the complex distribution β λ, where λ is the intersection of the Riemann surfaces of the analytical continuation of the functions LN 12 (β) and LN2 (β). We will assume that the functions of U and V satisfy the partial condition on infinity: there is the number R0> 0, such as for anywhere M, such that | m | > R0, the functions U and v are represented in the form U = ger∑ n = − least αne inφh (1) n (χ1 (β) r), v = ger∑ n = − least βne inφh (1) n (χ2 (β2 ) r), (3) where r and φ are the polar coordinates of the point m. Similarly [1], looking for solutions to the problem (1) - (3) in the form of the potentials of the simple layer U (m) = ∫ c fj (β; m, m0) ∗J (m0) DCM0 V (m) = ∫ c fj (β; M, m0) ψj (m0) DCM0, (4) where fj (β; m, m0) = i 4 h (1) 0 (χj | m −m0 |) (5) - fundamental solution to the Helmholtz equation (1), a ∗j, ψj - unknown densities belonging to the space of the functions continuous in helder, we obtain the task: to determine such β ∈ λ, in which there are non -trivial solutions of the system of integral equations t1 accord, t2 accord, t1ψ1 - t2ψ2 = 0, 1 χ21 [βk1ψ1 + ε1ω (P1phouses + 1 2 ∗)] - - 1 χ22 [βk2ψ2 + ε2ω (p2aper - 1 2 onic)] = 0, (6) 245 1 χ21 [βk1 accord (p1ψ1 + 1 2 ψ1)] — - 1 χ22 [ βk2 accord + ε2ψ (p2ψ2 - 1 2 ψ2)] = 0, where (tj venting) = ∫ c φj (β; m, m0) onic (m0) dcm0, (pj pul) (m) = ∫ c ∂ ∂νm Φj (β; m, m0) onic (m0) dcm0, (kj pul) (m) = ∫ c ∂ ∂τm φj (β; m, m0) onic (m0) DCM0, J = 1, 2. Note that that The nuclei of the TJ operators have a logarithmic feature when the arguments coincide, the nucleus of the PJ operators do not have they are features, and the nuclei of the KJ operators have a feature like koshi. We highlight the features analytically: we introduce integrated operators with features in the form of the amount of the operator without features and operator with known own values ​​and own functions. We get: r (1) 2 (β) x1 + (r (1) 1 (β) −r (1) 2 (β)) x2 + lx1 = 0, (7) r (1) 2 (β) y1 + (R (1) 1 (β) −r (1) 2 (β) y2 + LY1 = 0, (8) (β β21 (R (3) 1 + S) - β χ22 (R (3) 2 + S)) y2 + β χ22 (r (3) 2 + s) y1 + (9) + ω ((ε1 χ21 + ε2 χ22) x2 - ε2 χ22 x1) + ω ((ε1 χ21 R (2) 1 - ε2 χ22 r (2) 2) x2 + ε2 χ22 r (2) 2 x1) = 0, (β χ21 (r (3) 1 + s) - β β22 (r (3) 2 + s)) x2 - (10 ) −µ0ω ((1 χ21 + 1 χ22) y2 - 1 χ22 y1) + 246 + β β22 (r (3) 2 + s) x1 - µ0ω ((1 χ21 r (2) 1 - 1 χ22 r (2) 2) x2 + ε2 χ22 r (2) 2 x1) = 0, where lx = - 1 2π 2π∫ 0 ln | sint - t0 2 | x (t0) dt0, r (k) j x = 1 2π∫ 0 h 0 h 0 h 0 H (k) j (β, t, t0) x (t0) dt0, j = 1, 2, k = 1, 2, 3, sx = 1 2π 2π∫ 0 ctg t0 - t 2 x (t0) dt0 + i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i iy 2π 2π∫ 0 x (t0) dt0, h (1) j (β; t, t0) = 2πφj (β; m, m0) + ln | sin t - t0 2 |. h (2) j (β, t0) = 4π | r ′ (t) | ∂ ∂νm φ (β, m, m0), h (3) j (β, t, t0) = 2 | r ′ (t) | ∂ ∂νm h (1) j (β, m, m0) - i. x1 (t) = (∗1 (t) - ∗2 (t)) | r ′ (t) |, x2 (t) = ∗ (t) | r ′ (t) |, y1 (t) = (ψ1 (t ) - ψ2 (t)) | r ′ (t) |, y2 (t) = ψ1 (t) | r ′ (t) |. Note that the functions h (i) j, i = 1, 2, 3, j = 1, 2, do not contain specialty. The system of equations (7) - (10) can be recorded in the form of a (β) W = 0. This task is a nonlinear spectral task for the operator A (β), β ∈ λ. We describe the method of its numerical solution. For the sampling of the operator A (β), we use the Galerkin method with a base of trigonometric functions. The choice of such a basis is based on the fact that the Eikt functions are its own functions of operators L and S in the corresponding spaces and they are responsible for their own values ​​(see, for example, [3]): λK = {ln (2) at K = 0, 1/1/1/1/ (2 | k |) with K 6 = 0} for the operator l and λ′k = {i at k ≥ 0, −i at k <0} for the operator s. As a result, 247 we obtain the task of determining the values ​​of β ∈ λ that meets non -explosive solutions of the system of linear algebraic equations an (β) Wn = 0, where the coefficients of the matrix an are integrated functions of the parameter β. As an approximate solution of the β of the initial problem (1) - (3) the roots of equations are selected | DET (A (β)) | = 0. (11) to localize the roots of β equation (11) function | DET (A (β)) | stable and determined the surroundings of the points are local
