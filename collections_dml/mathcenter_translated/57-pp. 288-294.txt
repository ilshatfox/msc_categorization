The materials of the school-conference of large k authors prove (using theλK) the existence of good matrices at s ≤ m/2, d = ω (p km). It turns out to be fair (see [6]) Drying 3. With a fixed K (and large S) forM> cs logk (ed/s), some implementation of the random matrix λk (M × D) will be S -Korosha.

Sabitov1 1 sabitov_fmf@mail.ru; Sterlitamak branch of the BashSU, Sterlitamak branch of the Institute of Strategic Studies of the Republic of Belarus in the work for various classes of the equations of hyperbolicotype in rectangular areas the first boundary task was studied. The criterion of uniqueness has been established. The solution was built in the form of the amount of orthogonal rows. When justifying the convergence of a series, the problem of small denominators from one and two variables arises. Estimates of the separation from zero with appropriate asymptotics have been established, which made it possible to prove the convergence of the rows in the class of regular solutions and the stability of the solution relative to boundary functions. K.B. Sabitov 289 Keywords: a wave equation, a wave equation of high orders, the task of the conductor, the criterion of uniqueness, existence, a row, small denominators, stability. 1. The task of the conductor for the string equation is the study of the issues of unstable fluctuations (vibration resonans in liquids in thin -walled tanks of missiles with its own vibrations) is closely related to the task of the conductor for the wave equation. This task was studied by many mathematicians (see [1, 2]). First, we consider the task of the conductor for the string equation UT T −UXX = 0 (1.1) in the rectangular area g = {(x, t) | 0 <x <l, 0 <t}, l, t> 0. The task of the conductor. Find the solution of equation (1.1) from class C 2 (G) ∩ C (G) in the region, which satisfies the boundary conditions U (0, T) = U (L, T) = 0, 0 ≤ T ≤ T, (1.2) u (x, 0) = onic (x), u (x, t) = ψ (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ l, (1.3) where ∗ (x), ψ (x) - specified sufficiently smooth functions, with This ∗ (0) = onic (l) = ψ (0) = ψ (l) = 0. Theorem 1.1. If there is a solution to the problem (1.1) - (1.3), then it is only when sinαπm ̸ = 0 for allm ∈N, i.e. When the ratio of the parties t /l = α of the rectangle is an irrational number. Let's move on to the substantiation of the existence of a solution to the problem (1.1) - (1.3). Let the condition sinαπm ̸ = 0 is fulfilled with all m ∈N. Then the solution of the problem of the conductor can be determined in the form of a number of a fourier u (x, t) = √ 2 l + φ∑ m = 1 um (t) sinµm x, (1.4) where um (t) = onic cosµ t + ψm ψm ψm ψm cosαπm sinαπm sinµm t, √ 2 l ∫ l 0 onic (x) sinµm x d x, ψm = √ 2 l ∫ l 0 ψ (x) sinµm x d x. Theorem 1.2. If the number α = t /l is an algebraic number of degrees N> 2 and functions ∗ (x), ψ (x) ∈ C 5 [0, l], ∗ (J) (0) = onic (J) (L) = = 0, ψ (j) (0) = ψ (j) (l) = 0, j = 0,2,4, then there is the only solution to the problem (1.1) - (1.3) and it is determined nearby (1.4). Theorem 1.3. If the number α has limited elements and functions ∗ (x), ψ (x) ∈ C 4 [0, l], onic (j) (0) = onic (j) (l) = ψ (j) (0) = (0) = ψ (j) (l) = 0, j = 0.2, then there is the only solution to the problem (1.1) - (1.3) and it is determined nearby (1.4). 290 Materials of the School Conference remark. Note that in the work [3, § 14], the unambiguous resolving of the task of the conductor for the string equation for all numbers µ = tt+l, satisfying the inequality ∣∣∣µ - m n ∣∣∣> k n3 at any m, n ∈N and Some k = const> 0, by the theory of display. 2. The task of the conductor for a two -dimensional equation of a hyperbolic type of high order will consider the equation in private derivatives LU = ∂ 2p U ∂t 2p - ∂ 2p U ∂x2p = f (x, t) (2.1) in the rectangular region d = {(x, t ) | 0 <x <l, 0 <t <t}, where l, t are the set positive numbers, p purpose, and set the following task. The task of the conductor. Find the function u (x, t) that meets the conditions: u ∈C 2P - 1 (d) ∩c 2p (d), (2.2) lu (x, t) ≡ f
