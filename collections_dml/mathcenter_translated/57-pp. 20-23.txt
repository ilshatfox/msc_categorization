UDC 517.16, 519.651 New approximations for the full elliptical integral of the 1st kind E.C. Alekseev1 1 kometaarella@mail.ru; Moscow State University. M.V. Lomonosov, Laboratory of Infinite Analysis and Mathematical Physics of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics for a complete elliptical integral of the 1st kind found its estimates from below and from above, expressed through elementary functions. The report shows the graphs of the received assessments, as well as the graphs of their relative errors, depending on the module of this integral. The suitability of the received approximations for engineering applications was discussed. Key words: hypergeometric function, Landen's transformation, ellipse length. Through the full elliptical integrals of the 1st kind (PEI-1): K (K) = ∫ π 2 0 d accord 1–k2 sin2 accord, k ∈ [0.1), (1) Solutions of a wide circle of mathematical, physical and technical are expressed tasks [1-4]. To find the numerical values ​​of function (1) there are a number of algorithms, for example, an algorithm based on the transformation of Landen [5]: K (K) = π 2 و n = 1 (1+ f n (K2)), (2) where where The symbol f N denotes N once the used function F (x) = 1 - p 1 - x 1+ p 1 - X, I display the gender of the interval [0.1) in myself. However, the endless work (2) is unsuitable for studying a number of issues arising, for example, when describing long Josephson contacts [2] or in the study of the range of communication channel [3], precisely due to the recurrent nature of this formula. The use of the well-known representation of PEI-1 by a steppe, which is a special case of hypergeometric function [1]: K (K) ≡ π 2 f (1 2, 1 2, 1; K2) = π 2 و n = 0 [(2n) !] 2 24n (n!) 4 k2n, (3) also does not lead to clarifying the behavior of “as a whole” expressions depending on the function (1), because these latter also boil down to the steppe rows, that is, an endless procedure again arises, True now in the form of summation. E.C. Alekseeva 21 Thus, to determine the global behavior of the values ​​that include PAI-1, it is advisable to have estimates for function (1), which boils to the final number of operations over elementary functions. One of the possible options for such assessments is given by the following theorem. With k ∈ (0.1) PAI-1 satisfies inequalities: k-(k) <k (k) <k+ (k), (4) where k-(k) = π 4k arcsink+ ln √ 1+ k 1–k   (5) and k + (k) = π 2 p 2k arcsin kp 2 + ln √ 1 + k 1–k 2–k + p 2–k2 2 + k + p 2–k2  . (6) The proof of the theorem is based on the known [1] formula for the derivative of the function (1): k dk (k) dk = e (k) 1–k2 −k (k), k ∈ (0.1), (7 ) where E (k) = ∫ π 2 0 √ 1–k2 sin2 accorder (8) is a complete elliptical integral of the 2nd genus (PAI-2) [1]. From the formula (7) it follows that the PEI-1 and PAI-2 are connected by integral correlation: K (K) = 1 K ∫ K 0 E (Q) 1–q2 d Q. (9) Further, it is well known that the length l of the ellipse with semi -hello A and B (A> b> 0) is expressed through function (8) as follows [5]: l = 4 ae  √ √ 1– b 2 a2                         . (10) On the other hand, in the book [6] (see task 17 of paragraph 4 of chapter 1) a bilateral estimate of the length L this ellipse through its semi -axles: π (a +b) ≤ l ≤π √ 2 (a2 +b2) . (11) Having rewritten the inequality (11) using the module K = p 1–b2/a2 PAI-2 from the formula (10), we find that: π 4 (1+ √ 1–K2) ≤ E (K) ≤ π 2 p 2 √ 2–k2, k ∈ [0.1]. (12) 22 Materials of the School-Conference Thus, combining formulas (9) and (12), by virtue of the known properties of the integral of Riemann, we will come to inequality (4), and the functions (5) and (6) are calculated as k-(k) = π 4k ∫ k 0 1+ √ 1–q2 1–q2 d Q and K+ (K) = π 2 p 2k ∫ k 0 √ 2–q2 1–q2 d q, respectively. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 K 1 2 3 4 KHKL Fig. 1.

The graphs of the relative error of the PAI-1 assessments from below (dashed line) and from above (point line) in Fig. 1 shows graphs of PAI-1 assessments from below and top depending on its module K. From this figure it can be seen that the graphs of functions (5) and (6) are quite satisfactory to the function of the function (1) (a continuous line in Fig. 1). In order to express the degree of this satisfaction quantitatively, we introduce the relative errors of the definition of PAI-1 by the approximations from below and from above: δ-k (k) = k (k) −k-(k) k (k), δ+k (k) = K +(k) −k (k) k (k). (13) E.C. Alekseeva 23 in Fig. 2 shows the dependencies (13) on the module of the elliptical integral k. Rice. 2 demonstrates that with k ∈ [0, 0.9], the functions (13) do not exceed the value of 0.01 (the horizontal line in Fig. 2), which is enough for engineering applications, for example, to determine the wave resistance of the strip line (see [see. 4] and links there). In conclusion, we note that since the functions K (K) and K (P 1–K2) are linearly independent solutions of the next differential equation of 2
