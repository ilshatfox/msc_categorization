) Cluster asymptotics of the indignation of the Laplace operator in the S2 sphere in the work [1] - [2] V. Guillaimin and N. The type inside one cluster studied asymptotic numbers of the operator L = ∆ + V in the sphere of SN with smooth odd potential V ( i.e., V (τs) = −v (s) for any s ∈ Sn, where τ is an anti -emergency display). In particular, the rating was received | µki - λki | = O (k - 2), I = 1, 2, ..., NK, where NK is the multiplicity of its own numbers λki operator L0 = ∆, µKi - the own numbers of the operator L. In the future, the asymptotic spectrum and regulatory traces for its own numbers Operator L in sphere S2 were investigated in [3] - [4] in the case of the odd V and in [5] - [7] - in the case of arbitrary V. In particular, from the results of work [7] it follows that with v ∈ C2 ( S2) there is an asymptotic formula k∑ i = −k [µki - λki - c0] = o (k - 1), (1) where λki = k (k+1) is the own numbers of the operator L0 frequency (2K+1) . It should be noted that from the evidence of the theorem 3 of the work [7] a stronger statement follows, namely, O (K -1) in the formula (1) can be replaced with O (K -α), α> 1, although this is not noted. In this work, we prove a stronger statement than the above, namely, the main theorem 1. Let V (ω) - an arbitrary, generally speaking, comprehensive function from class C3 (S2). Then, for the own numbers of the operator L, the asymptotic formula K∑ i = −k µki = (2k + 1) [K (K + 1) + C0] + C1k −2 + O (K -2), (2) where C0 = where C0 = 1 4π ∫ s2 v (ω) dω, c1 = 1 32π3 ∫ s2 ∫ s2 v (ω) v (ω0) √ 1– ( - → ω, - → ω0) dωdω0 - 1 16π ∫ s2 v 2 (ω) dω dω , ( - → ω, - → ω0) - scalar product of vectors - → ω = (cos onic ). 260 Proof. Let r0 = (l0 - ze) −1, r = (l - ze) −1 - resolvengtes, λk = k (k + 1), µki, k = 0, 1, 2, ..., −k 6 i 6 k, - respectively, the own values ​​of the operators L0 and L; f (i) k = y i k (∗, θ) - spherical functions (the Orthonor of the world's own functions of the operator L0). Then, due to the limited operator V, the number ρ> || v ||. By applying the SP operator ( - 1 2πi ∮ | λk --z | = ρ z (·) DZ) (SP - trace of the nuclear operator) to both parts of the identity R (Z) = R0 (Z) - R0 (Z) V R0 (Z ) + (R0 (z) v) 2r0 (z) + · · + (−1) n (r0 (z) v) nr0 (z) + · · · and using the deduction theorem, we get k∑ i = —- k µki = (2k + 1) [k (k + 1) + c0] + αk + β (1) k + β (2) k + ... + β (n) k + ... (3) where αk = inous∑ m = 0, m6 = k amk λk - λm, amk = k∑ s = −k m∑ l = −m (v (l) m, f (s) 2, (4) β (j) k = (−1) j+1 2πi sp ∮ | λk --z | = ρ z ((r0 (z) v) j+2 r0 (z) dz, j = 1, 2, ... from we conclude equalities (3): since β (j) k is the subsequent amendments of the theory of disturbances and their order with k → φ is less than the αk order, it is enough to prove the following theorem. Theorem 2. Let K à 1 and V ∈ is enough to prove formula (2) C3 (S2). (2k + 1) (2m + 1) 16π2 ∫ s2 ∫ s2 v (gment, θ) v (wor0, θ0) pk (cos α) pm (cos α) ds ds ds DS S0, where ds = sin θ dθd accord, ds0 = sin θ0 dison, cos α = ( - → ω, - → ω0), pk (cos α) - the lynastra polynomials, normalized by the condition pk (1) = 1. Next, we introduce the unitary matrix T (ω0) =   sin ∗0 cos θ0 cos ∗0 sin θ0 cos ∗0 - cos ∗0 cos θ0 sin θ0 sin θ0 sin ∗0 0 - sin θ0 cos θ0   (5) 261 and vector ω̃ = (sin α cos ψ, sin α sin ψ, cos α), 0 6 α 6 π, 0 6 ψ 6 2π. Then, for AKM numbers, we get the formula AKM = (2K + 1) (2M + 1) 16π2 π∫ 0 Q (α) pk (cos α) pm (cos α) sin αdα, (6) q (α) = 2π∫ 0 dψ ∫ s2 v (ω0) v (t (ω0) ω̃) dω0. (7) Note that Q ′ (0) = Q ′ (π) = 0, which is easy to verify, using formulas (5) and (7). Since 2π∫ 0 sin ψdψ = 2π∫ 0 cos ψdψ = 0, then (7) of the smoothness of functions Q and V coincide. Further, since π∫ 0 pk (cos α) pm (cos α) sin αdα = 0 at m 6 = k, then by virtue of equality [8] (p. 41) I (α, m, k) = α∫ 0 pk (cos θ) pm (cos θ) sin θdθ = = 1 (m - k) (m + k + 1) [mpk (cos α) PM -1 (cos α) - - qpm (cos α) pk- 1 (cos α) - (m - k) cos αpk (cos α) pm (cos α)], (8) by intriguing (6) in parts, we get akm = (2k + 1) (2m + 1) 16π2 π∫ 0 q ′ (α) i (α, m, k) dα. (9) In order to study αk, inequalities will be needed [9] (p. 172) for polynomials of the Lyandra √ sin α | pk (cos α) | <√ 2/(πk), 0 6 α 6 π, k = 1, 2, ..., (10) and asymptotic formula [8] (chap. VI, §2); [10] (c. 302) pk (cos α) = cos [(k + 1/2) α - π/4] sin1/2 α {f0 k1/2 + f1 k3/2 + f2 k5/2 + o (k --7/2)} + 262 + sin [(k + 3/2) α - π/4] sin3/2 α {g0 k3/2 + g1 k5/2 + o (k --7/2)}}} + + cos [(k + 5/2) α - π/4] sin5/2 α {d0k −5/2 + o (k --7/2)} + o (1) k --7/2 sin --7 /2 α, (11) where K> 1, ε 6 α 6 π - ε ∀ε> 0, f0 = √ 2/π, f1 = - (3/8) √ 2/π, g0 = (1/8 ) √ 2/π, f2, g1, d0 - permanent. In the future, we also need an estimate of the amount RK = ∑ m6 = k k1 --αm1 --β | m - k | q (m + k) p for k → ∞. To this end, we will prove Lemma. Lemma 1. For k à 1 and p + q + β> 2 there is an asymptotic rk = {o (k - α --β + 2 ln k), β 6 2; O (k - p --α), β> 2}, q = 1; Rk = {o (k - α --β+2), β 6 2; O (k - α --β + 2) + o (k --p - α
