) The relic of the assaditipatriom for the Lavrentiev -Bitsadze equation with operas and the thor of the demon of the seel is considered the equation of the type of their + sign ybyu = o, 82 k fj where VU = 8 2 + -8 is the Bessele operator. U U (1) Let D - an area limited at x , and at x $ about the characteristic of the aircraft of the equation (1), emerging from point B and intersecting with the ox oo at point C (-1.0) and a segment [s, o] axis oh. Part of the region D, lying in the half-plate x> o (x <o), denote through d+ (d-). 147 Task. Find in the area j) an even equalization solution (1), continuous in D, taking on the curve of and on the characteristics of the Armed Forces of the EAAD ~ -t continuous values ​​ILG = <p (s), ULVC = 'Lf; ), and satisfying under x = about the conditions “gluing u (+o, y) = and (-0, y), di (+o, y) dh dh (-0, y) dh (2) (3) Let U (x, y) - solution to the problem (1) - (3). Enter the designations u (o, y) == t (y), o <1, and "(o, y) = v (y), o <u <1. (4) (5) let U (x , y) - solving the problem of type N: Find the even solution of the equation {1) in the area D+, satisfying the grains of the same ustobi. , y) - Solving the problem of Koshi: Finding even the equalization of equalities. Then u (x, y) determined by the formula and (x, y) = {~ (x, y) (x, y) e d+, and (x, y) (x, y) e D will be solving the problem (1 )- (3) if it satisfies the second condition from (3) and condition (4). By substituting (6) in condition (4) and in the second boundary condition (2), we obtain relatively T (y) and v (y) system of integral equations. The unambiguous resolution of the obtained system of integral equi is clearly proved. 148
