The dual geometry of the regular hyperpolos distribution in the space of affino-metric coherence in the work of the indexes accept the following values: ī, j̄ = 0, n; I, j, k, l = 1, n; i, j, k, s = 1, m; u, v, w = m + 1, n - 1; α = m + 1, n. 14 Consider the space of affinity AN, N, determined by the system n (n + 1) forms of Pfaff {θi, θij} [2], rist, rijst - tensors, respectively, the torsion and curvature of this space. It is known [4] that the system (n + 1) 2 pfuff forms {ωī j̄}, where ωi0 = θ i, ω00 = - 1 n + 1 θkk, ω i j = θ i j - 1 n + 1 δijθ k, ω 0 J = 0, (1) determines the space of projective connectedness PN, N, associated with AN, N. In the space of PN, N, we consider the regular hyperpolos distribution of the M-dimensional linear elements h, m <n-1 [5], determined by the system of differential equations ωni = λ n ikω k 0, ω v i λ v ikω k 0, ω n v = a N vαω α v, ω i v = n i vkω k 0. Distribution H in the space of an, n in the 2nd differential surroundings of its forming element induces: 1) the space of projective connectedness p̄n, n, dual associated with an, n space pn, n, and the spaces of pn, n and p̄n, n can be flat only at the same time; 2) the variety of h̄ in p̄n, n, dual source. Theorem 1. If the layer forms θkn, θ v n initial space are turned into zero, then the space of projective connectedness p̄n, n is associated with the space of affinity ān, n according to the scheme (1) determined by the system of forms of the pfuff {θ̄i, θ̄ij}, where θ̄i = ω̄i0, θ̄ i j = ω̄ i j - δij ω̄00. In conditions of theorem1 of space an, n and ān, n are dual in relation to each other; The ratios θkn = θ v n = 0 (2) 15 are a necessary condition for the duality of the spaces an, n and ān, n. According to [1] associated with an, n space pn, n is called the space of projective-metric coherence KN, N, if it has an invariant field of local hyperkvadrick Q2N-1: AIKX IXK + 1 C (GI0X I + CX0) 2 = 0, A [Ik] = 0, g0i = gi0, g00 = C = const 6 = 0. The space of an, n is called the space of the affino-meter coherence of mn, n [3] if the space is, n, associated with the original space of affinity anch , n, is the space of projective-metric coherence KN, N. It is shown that the space of projective connectedness 0 p̄ n, n without steaming is the space of projective-metric coherence 0 k̄ n, n with the field of local absoluts Q̄2N-1, the equations of which are recorded in the form of āik x̄ i x̄k + 1 c (ḡi0x̄ i + cx̄0) 2 = 0, āik = āki, ḡi0 = ḡ0i, C = const 6 = 0. According to theorem 1, the necessary condition, under the performance of which the space is 0 k̄ n, n is associated according to the scheme (1) with some space of affiliate-metric coherence 0 M̄ N, N without steepness, is the execution of ratios (2) for the space of affino-metric coherence 0 m n, n without torsion; In this case, the spaces are 0 m n, n and 0 m̄ n, n are dual spaces of affinant-metric coherence without twisting. 16 L and T R A T R A 1.
