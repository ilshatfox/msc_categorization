Keywords: Boror inequality, analytical functions. The classic result of H. Bora [1], which was brought into the final form M. Rice, I. Shur and F. Wiener, is as follows: Suppose that f (z) = ∑ happen K = 0 AK Z K is an analytical function in D and | f (z) | ≤ 1 for all z ∈ D. Then φ∑ k = 0 | AK | R K ≤ 1 for all R ≤ 1 3, (1) where R = | Z |, moreover, constant 1/3 cannot be improved. We obtained the following results. Theorem 1. Let f (z) = ∑ happen k = 0 ak z k - analytical function in d and | f (z) | ≤ 1 for all z ∈ D. Then | A0 | + 1 4 (1 - | A0 | 2) 2 1–4 (1- | A0 | 2) + ger k = 1 | AK | R K ≤ 1 for all R ≤ 1 3, (2) where r = | z |, moreover, constants 1/3, 1/4 (in the numerator) and 1/4 (in the denominator) cannot be improved. Theorem 2. Let us predict that f (z) = ∑ happen k = 0 ak z k is an analytical function in D and | f (z) | ≤ 1 for all z ∈ D.

UDC 517.275, 517.517 The criterion of complete α -appropriation for polyarmonic functions K.F. Amozov1, E.G. Ganenkova2, S. Ponnusov3 1 amokira@rambler.ru; Petrozavodsk State University 2 g_ek@inbox.ru; Petrozavodsk State University 3 samy@isichennai.res.in; Indian Statistical Institute, Chenna Center Sets The article presents a criterion for complete α -appropriation for polygarmonic functions. As a result, hence the criterion of complete star -shaped (case α = 0) for polyarmonic functions. Keywords: polygarmonic function, quite α -appropriate function, α -perishable area, star -shaped area. In some sections of mathematics (for example, in the theory of investment, in the theory of integrated representations of the function, in matters of the boundary behavior of the functions, the resolving of the task of the conductor), it is important that the area of ​​determination of the function of the pipe satisfies the condition of the cone, i.e., so that there are universal for ω of the number α ∈ (0; 1) and h ∈ (0; φ] are that for each point p ∈ PiPON, the straight circular cone v (l (p), h) with the top at point P, solution απ, height H, axis of symmetry l (p) lay in ω [1]. We denote through BN [x, r] the closed Euclides ball in RN with the center at point X and radius R. B [2] α -appropriate areas were determined: determination 1. [2] area ⊂ rn, 0 ∈ ω is called α -peril (relatively 0), α ∈ [0; 1), if for each point p ∂ω there is such a number R = R (p)> 0, that cone k+(p , α, r) = {x ∈Bn [p, r]: (x −p, p∥p∥) ≥ ∥x −x −cosαπ 2} ⊂rn \ ω. In [2] it was shown that the α -perical areas are areas with the condition of the cone, while l (p) = −p, and it was proved that the α -appropriate areas are
