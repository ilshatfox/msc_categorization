New cases of solvability of the problem of Gurs in quadrature in the work considered the task of Gurs. In the area d = {x0 <x1, y0 <y <y1}, find the regular solution of the equation uxy + aux + buy + cu = f, (1) satisfying the conditions u (x0, y) = onic (y), u ( x, y0) = ψ (x), onic (y0) = ψ (x0), x ∈ [x0, x1], y ∈ [x0, x1]. (2) It is known that the task (1) - (2) is definitely solved once. Cases of resolving this task in quadrature are given in [1, p. 15–16], [2], [3]. The aim of our study is to highlight new cases of resolving the task in quadrature. The results can be formulated in terms of the following ratios 2h - (LNH) XY - K ≡ 0; (3) h ≡ 2γ1 (x) δ1 (y) 6 = 0, k ≡ 3γ1 (x) Δ1 (y) 6 = 0; (4) 76 V. I. Zhegalov, E. A. Sozontova (LNH) XY ≡ H - K, H ≡ 2by ≡ 2S ′ 1 (X) T ′ 1 (Y) (2–M1) [S1 (X) + t1 (y)] 2; (5) 2k - (ln k) xy - h ≡ 0; (6) h ≡ 3γ2 (x) δ2 (y) 6 = 0, k ≡ 2γ2 (x) Δ2 (y) 6 = 0; (7) (ln k) xy ≡ k - h, k ≡ 2ax ≡ 2s ′ 2 (x) t ′ 2 (y) (2–m2) [s2 (x) + t2 (y)] 2. (8) Here H = Ax+AB - C, K = BY+AB - C, γK, ΔK ∈ C1, SK, TK, MK ∈ C2 (K = 1, 2), and MK depends on only one of the variables (x, y) and do not accept the value of 2. Theorem.
