. Complex constant distribution of elastic waveguide for the case of the border with friction of K. N. Vdovin Nimm named after N. G. Chebotarev Kazan State University has studied the task of linear elastic harmonic ceremonies in the strip thick a, density ρ and with the coefficient of Tami Lame λ and µ. Such fluctuations are described by the equation of motion and the law of Hook. There are cases when the upper 36 surface is free, and the bottom glides with dry or viscous friction. For example, in the case of a viscous slip of the boundary, the dispersion equation for determining the ownership of the spread of the elastic wave has the type [1] ρω2γ1 [∆own (1 - ei2a (γ1 + γ2)) + γaff (ei2aγ1 - ei2aγ2)] + + ωt [γival (ξ2 - γ1γ2) (ei2aγ1 + ei2aγ2) - - - - - - ∆ etc. (ξ2 + γ1γ2) (1 + ei2a (γ1 + γ2)) + + 16µship (2µship (2µү2 - ρω2) eia (γ1 + γ2)] = 0, where ork = 4µ 2 ing2γ1γ2 + (2µicle2 - ρω2) 2, γă = −4µ2ăγ2 + (2µship - ρω2) 2, γj (₽) = - √ k2j - ₽2, k21 = ρω2 λ + 2µ, k22 = ρω2 µ - wave, t. - friction coefficient, ω is a circular frequency. Complex roots of the characteristic equations of found by Newton. The values ​​of the lection form a counting multiple and are located four in each quadran those complex plane, differing from each other with signs in front of the material and imaginary parts. The difference between the prophetic parts of the neighboring roots cil strives for the size (π/a) ln n+1 n, and the difference between imaginary - to the value π/a. Similar results were obtained for cases when the upper surface is free, and the lower one was fixed, free or sliding without friction [2]. It should be noted that with the growth of number N, complex in cases for cases with the friction strive for their own respects of the elastic waveguide with a slippery border. The values ​​of 37 roots with a large number N depend only on the thickness of the elk A and do not depend on the parameters of the medium. L and T R A T R A 1. Tumakov D.N.
