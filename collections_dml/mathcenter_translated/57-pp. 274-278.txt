Prokhorov1 1 prochorovdv@info.sgu.ru; Saratov State University, Petrozavodsk State University. The article discusses the solutions G (Z, T) of the chord differential equation of Levner, for which the reverse conformal display f (w, t) = G -1 (W, t) translate the upper half -sophistication to the semi -plate with an analytical cut Γ. Asymptotic connections between F (W, T), γ and the control function λ (t) are studied in the leuner equation with small values ​​T> 0, when γ has a touch of some order with a material axis. A model case is a cut along a circular arc or the degree of circular arc. Sufficient conditions are displayed to combine the asymptotic representation of the display in the analytical angle of the π solution and in analytical caspe. Keywords: one -leaf function, Levner’s equation, tangent incision, control function. The conformal display f of the upper half -fluidity h = {w ∈ C: IM w> 0} on a single -copied area G with a locally coherent boundary allows a continuous continuation to the axis R = ∂H. The border ∂g of the area G has the angle of the solution απ, 0 ≤α≤ 2, at the point of the simple end corresponding to x0 ∈ R, f (x0) ̸ = urb, if limx → x0 --arg (f (x) - f (x0) ) = Ψ and limx → x0+(f (x) - f (x0)) = ψ+απ, x ∈ R. Be behavior f in the semi -ox of point x0 is described, for example, in the monograph of the pommerinka [7], theorem 3.11 for 0 <α α α α α α <2 and the theorem 11.16 for α = 0. The angle of the zero solution is called caps. More detailed asymptotic behavior f in the vicinity of the prototype of the top of the Caspa was investigated in [2], [3], [8]. A special case of the CASPA arises for the semi -plate with a section of γ, tangent to R, for example, at a point z0 = 0, that is, g = h γ, γ⊂ (h∪ {0}). Care γ can be D.V. Prokhorov 275 set in the form of parameter T, which serves as a capacity of the curve γ [0, t] relatively. Namely, for any T, 0 ≤ T ≤ T, there is a conformal display G (·, t): h \ γ [0, t] → H with hydrodynamic standardization g (z, t) = z + 2t z + o ( 1 z2), z → ∞. Evolution G (Z, ·) in time T is described by the chord differential equation of Levner ∂g (z, t) ∂t = 2 g (z, t) −λ (t), g (z, 0) = z, z ∈H , 0 ≤ t ≤ t, with a continuous material control function λ (t) = g (γ (t), t). Consider the γ section, which has a touch of the order n −2, n ≥ 3, with the axis R at point 0. Let the tangent vector to γ ​​[0, t] at the point z0 = 0 has a zero argument. Negative material semi -axis R - forms the angle of solution π with γ, while the positive material semi -axis R+ forms an CASP with γ. The two sides of the section γ [0, t] have images [α (t), λ (t)] ⊂ r and [λ (t), β (t)] ⊂ r when displayed w = g (z, t), respectively . For the analytical cut and angle of solution π from the results of the left [5], an asymptotic representation of behavior f (w, t) = g - 1 (w, t) with a fixed t ∈ [0, t] in the vicinity of the point α (t), f (W, t) = n∑ n = 0 n∑ m = 0 qnm (W --α (t)) n+1 logm (w - α (t))+o ((w --α (t)) n+ 1 logn (W --α (t))), Q00 ̸ = 0, where W strives for α (t) along any way BH, including boundary segments. We demand a certain uniformity of tons of the levai, putting W = λ (t) and fixing t to 0. We will say that the control function λ in the Levner equation, which generates γ, has property 1 if with t →+0 f (λ (t. ), t) = n - 2∑ n = 0 n∑ m = 0 qnm (λ (t) −α (t)) n+1 logm (λ (t) −α (t))+o ((w - ( α (t)) n -1 logn - 2 (λ (t) −α (t))). According to Pommerenka, we will write an asymptotic representation F (W, T) in the vicinity of point β (t) 1 f n - 2 (w, t) = - log (w ββ (t)) π +o (v - log (w - log. β (t))), a> 0, w → β (t), w ∈H∪R. We again demand some uniformity of the condition of the pomp in the property 1, putting W = β (t) and fixing T to 0. We will say that the control function λ in the leuner equation, which generates γ, has the property of 2 if 1 F N -2 (λ (t), t) = (1 q00 (λ (t) −α (t)) n - 2 - a log (λ (t) β (t)) π +o (log (λ (t) - - α (t)) 2 - n)+ o (log (λ (t) −β (t))), t → 0+. 276
