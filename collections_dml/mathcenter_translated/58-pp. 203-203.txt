Properties of five-dimensional H-spaces of D.R. Khakimov1 1 dzhamoliddink@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky examines the curvature of 5-dimensional hard H-spaces of the type {32}, there are necessary and sufficient conditions under which these spaces have constant curvature K. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a non-metathetic projective movement in the named H-consumptions of inconsistent curvature are established and, as a result, the structure of the non-metathetic projective algebra is determined in such spaces. Keywords: five-dimensional pseudorimano diversity, Eisenhart equation, projective algebra Lee, H-space type {32}. On the Properties of Five-Dimensional Rigid H-Space D.R.

Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for the Existence of A Non-Homothetical Projective Motion in the Named H -spaces of a Non-Constant Curvature Are Installed. As acksequence, The Structure of the Non-Homothetical Projective Lie Algebra in Such Spaces Is Described.
