UDC 517.54 The heterogeneous regional task of Hilbert with the final number of rupture points of the second kind of P.L. Shabalin1, A.Kh. Fatykhov2 1 Pavel.shabalin@mail.ru; Kazan State Architectural and Construction University 2 Vitofat@gmail.ru; The Kazan State Architectural and Construction University in the article considers the heterogeneous regional task of Hilbertheuria of analytical functions with an infinite index for half-plane. The coefficients of the regional condition are continuous through the gelder everywhere, except for the final number of specials in which the argument of the function of the coefficients has ruptures of the second kind (a steppe order with an indicator less than a unit). The formulas of a general solution to a heterogeneous problem have been obtained, the issues of existence and uniqueness of the solution were considered. In the study of the solution, an apparatus of the theory of entire functions and the geometric theory of functions of a complex alternating was used. Key words: Hilbert's task, principle of Lindelef, endless index, whole functions. 1. The setting of the problem is E+ = {z: z = x+ i y, 0 <y} - the upper half -plane in the plane of the complex alternating z, l = ∂e+. Consider the regional task of Hilbert theory of analy 156 Materials of the Youth School-Conference of Technical Functions with a regional condition on the material axis A (t) reaction (t) −b (t) IMφ (t) = C (t), t ∈ L. We first consider The heterogeneous task of Hilbert for the semi -skeleton with the final river of the points of bilateral turbulence. Here, the coefficients of the regional condition of Hilbert's heterogeneous task are continuously on Heldera everywhere on the material axis except the final number of special points T0 = ger and T J, J = 1, N, in which the argument of the function of the coefficients (ARG [A (t) - i b (t)]) It has ruptures of the second kind of steppe. We write the regional condition of the Hilbert problem in the form of re [e --iν (t) φ (t)] = c (t) | g (t) | , t ∈ L, T ̸ = T J, J = 1, N, (1) where g (t) = A (t) - I B (t), moreover, A2 (t)+B2 (t) ̸ = 0 everywhere on L and function ν (t) = argg (t), continuous for L everywhere except points T0, T J, J = 1, N, in which it has breaks of the second kind. Namely, the performance ν (t) = n∑ j = 0 ν j (t)+ ν̃ (t), ν0 (t) = {ν --tρ, t> 0, ν+ | t | ρ, t <0, ν j (θ) =  ν ν --j (t j - t) ρ j, t <t j, ν+ j | t j - t | ρ j, t j <t, j = 1, n with some numbers ν+, ν -, ν+ j, ν --j, ρ, 0 <ρ <1, ρ j, 0 <ρ j <1, j = 1, n, function ν̃ (t) ∈ HL ( µ). Here HL (µ) is a class of functions ν̃ (t) that satisfy the condition of the Helder with the indicator µ through the entire circuit l, including an infinitely removed point. We also think, | g (t) | ∈ HL (µ), C (t) ∈ HL (µ). First, we get the formula of the general solution and we examine the resolution of a homogeneous problem, that is, we determine the function φ (z), analytical and limited in the area of ​​e+ by the regional condition of re [e -iν (t) φ (t)] = 0, t ∈ L, T ̸ = t j, j = 1, n. Note that the general solution and some results in solvability are one native task of Hilbert on a circle with a final number of points of bilateral turpentine were obtained in [1]. 2. Solving a homogeneous problem of theorem 1. General solution to the homogeneous regional problem in the class of limited in E+ functions is given by the formula φ (z) = −i eiγ (z) exp {i le iαzρ} n∏ j = 1 exp {i l j e iα j (t j (t j (t j (t j. - t) ρ j} f (z), (2) P.L. Shabalin, A.Kh. Fatykhov 157 where f (z) arbitrary analytical in e+ function that satisfies inequalities  | f (z) | ≤c1e c2/| t j --z | ρ j, z → t j, z ∈ E+, 0 <ρ j <1, j = 1, n, | f (z) | ≤c1ec2 | z | ρ, z → mit, z ∈ E+, 0 <ρ <1, and at the boundary l conditions IMF (t) = 0, t ∈ L, T ̸ = T J, | F (T) | ≤c exp {q0 (t)+ n∑ j = 1 q j (t)}, c = const, t ∈ L. 3. The conditions for solvability of a homogeneous problem of theorem 2. The homogeneous regional task a) does not have non -trivial limited solutions if Conditions ν --j cos (πρ j) are fulfilled --ν+j ≤ 0, ν --j ose+j cos (πρ j) ≤ 0, j = 1, n, and at least one of the inequalities is strict; b) has the only solution of the species φ (z) = −i aeγ (z), a = const, ima = 0, if ν --j cos (πρ j) —ν+j = 0, ν - j --ν+j cos (πρ j) = 0, j = 1, n. Now we consider the following Hilbert's homogeneous tasks for the half -sophistication of E+ with a bilateral twilight of the steppe order at a single point: re [e -iν0 (t) φ0 (t)] = 0, t ∈ L, ν0 (t) = {ν --tρ, t> 0, ν+| t | ρ, t <0, (3) re [e -iν j (t) φ j (t)] = 0, t ∈ L, t ̸ = t j, ν j (θ) =    ν --j (t j - t) ρ j, t <t j, ν+ j | t j - t | ρ j, t j <t, j = 1, n, (4) 4. Solution the heterogeneous task of theorem 3. If the tasks (3) and (4) for all J = 1, N have an infinite set of solutions each, then the general solution of the heterogeneous regional problem (1) is represented as the sum of functions (2) and φ
