UDC 517.938.25 High -quality study of the family of dynamic systems with polynomial right -wing parts in the circle of Poincar I.A. Andreev1, A.F. Andreev2, T.O. Efimova3 1 Irandr@inbox.ru; SPBPU Peter the Great 2 Irandr@inbox.ru; SPBPU Peter the Great 3 Substress@mail.ru; SPBPU Peter the Great considers a wide family of dynamic systems characterized by the presence of polynomial right parts of the species d x d t = x (x, y), d y d t = y (x, y), where x (x, y), y (x, y) essence is the essence Mutually simple forms of phase variables of the X and Y system, while X is a polynoma of the third degree, representing a cubic form, while Y -Polin of the second degree, which is a quadratic form. For them, x (0.1) y (0.1) ̸ = 0. For the studied systems, we set the goal of building in the circle of Poincar all the phase portraits existing them with the establishment of each portrait close to coefficient criteria, solving this problem using the method of sequential displays (central and orthogonal, i.e. I.A. Andreeva, A.F. Andreev, T.O. Efimova 33 Poincare methods). Both qualitative and quantitative results are indicated. Key words: dynamic system, phase portrait, Poincare sphere, Poincare circle, special points, trajectories. The work considers and is examined in detail on the material plane of phase variables X, Y, a wide family of dynamic systems containing in their right parts of the polynoma, the type D x d t = x (x, y), d y d t = y (x, y), (1) where X (x, y), y (x, y) - mutually simple polynomials from x and y, such that x is the cubic form, and y - quadratic, x (0.1)> 0, y (0.1) > 0. The task of determining and building a puankar in the circle of all realized (topologically different) phase portraits (1) systems with the establishment (close to coefficient) criteria for each phase portrait is set and solved. To solve this problem, the method of sequential display, proposed by Henri Poincare: 1) the central display (from the center (0.0.1) of the sphere σ: x2+ y2+ z2 = 1) of the plane x, y, supplemented by an infinitely removed straight line (i.e.. planes r̄2x, y) on the sphere (puankara) σ with identified diametrically opposite points, 2) orthogonal display of the lower closed hemisphere σ on the circle (puankar) ω̄: x2 + y2 ≤ 1 with identical boundary diametrically opposite points γ ([1], p. . 241–249). When studying this family of dynamic systems, a number of methods were used, specially designed for the purposes of this study by the authors, primarily A.F. Andreev. The initial extensive family is split into subfamily, which can be classified as belonging to several hierarchical levels. Due to this approach, the research algorithm includes several steps or sections. Turning to the first level of the hierarchy of subsystems, we begin their consideration with those (1)-systems, the decomposition of polynomials X (x, y) and y (x, y) of which contain 3 and 2 multipliers, respectively, that is, respectively, i.e. . they have the form (3.2)-systems: x (x, y) = p3 (y −u1x) (y −u2x) (y −u3x), y (x, y) = c (y −q1x) (y –q2x ) where P3> 0, C> 0, U1 <U2 <u3, Q1 <Q2, UI ̸ = Q J with any I and J. For (3.2)-systems, we introduce concepts that are later introduced for all other varieties of subsystems lying at the first level given by the authors of the hierarchy. Let p (u), q (u) - Polynomas of the system: p (u): = x (1, u) ≡ p3 (u −u1) (u −u2) (u --u3), q (u): = Y (1, u) ≡ c (u –Q1) (u –Q2); PKP (PKQ) - an increasing sequence of all material roots of the polynoma of the system P (u) (Q (U)), PKPQ - an increasing sequence of all material roots of both polynomas of the system P (U), Q (U).
