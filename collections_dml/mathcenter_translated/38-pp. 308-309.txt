Sharipova Kazan Plain-Weevlet Veilta were introduced relatively recently, in the late 1980s. Some of the well -known Veneestitis set about shame of formulas, others are constructed theoretically. In this work, using the results of Monogra of FII [1], an attempt was made to construct the venules of Battla Lemary. The following B-deposits are taken as the source material: {1, V (x) = O, O ~ x ~ 1, x ( /_ [O, 1]; BN+1 (X) = /'x B "(T" (T ) dt, lx-l n;: Veivet Batrla - Lemary or SPJJAine Veivet, corresponding to the chosen p.
