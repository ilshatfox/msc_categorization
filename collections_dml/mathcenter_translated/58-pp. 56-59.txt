Gallamova1 1 gallyamova_o_r@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the work obtained obvious solutions with flat symmetry of 4 measures in the framework of F (R) gravity with an additional two-dimensional spherical space. It is shown that in this space there are gravitational singularities. Restrictions on the parameters of the model F (R) gravity in which solutions exist. Key words: f (r) gravity, additional measurements, flat symmetry introduction of compact additional spaces are a widely used idea. Their consideration in physical theories helps to advance in such complex issues as the unification of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions, the masses of neutrinos, the problems of the cosmological constant and so on. Any multidimensional model with low energies should lead to a four -dimensional theory, which will indicate the presence of a connection between them. The theories of gravity with the highest derivatives are often considered in modern studies, despite the difficulties that gives rise to such an approach. Numerous articles are devoted to F (R) gravity - one of the simplest generalizations of Einstein's gravity theory. Chop cases f (r) gravity are the theory of Gauss-Bonne. In this work, a solution was obtained with a flat symmetry of 4 measures in the framework of F (R) gravity with an additional two-dimensional spherical space. O.R. Gallamova 57 Equations F (R) Gravity Action F (R) of gravity in the six -dimensional space has the following type S = ∫ D 6x p --g f (r), (1) where f (r) is the function of the scalar curvature of the space -time R. equation Such the theory has the form of −1 2 f (r) Δba + (rba + ∇a∇b −δbaä) fr = 0, (2) where a, b, c, ... = 1.2,3,4,5 , 6, ∇a - designation of a covariant derivative, and ä = g ab∇a∇b. If the space-time has a flat symmetry, then its first quadratic form in the assumption that additional space is a two-dimensional sphere of a constant radius can be recorded in the form of D S2 = E (X) 2D T 2-D X2 —M (X) 2 (X) 2 (X) 2 (X) 2 (X) 2 (X) 2 D Y2 + D Z2) −L20 (dθ2 + sin2θdφ2). (3) Non -trivial equations (2) of the theory in question in the metric (3) take the form (t t) ⇒ Frr r ′ 2 + (r ′ ′ + 2r ′ m ′ m) FRR + (—E ′ E −2e ′ E M ′ M) fr - f 2 = 0, (4) (x x) ⇒ (e ′ e +2 m ′ m) frr r ′ + (—e ′ ′ e −2 m ′ ′ m) fr - f 2 = 0, (5) (y y) = (z z) ⇒ frrr r ′ 2 + (r ′ ′ + r ′ e ′ e + r ′ m ′ m) frir + (−m ′ ′ m ′ 2 m 2 - e ′ E m ′ m) fr - f 2 = 0, (6) (θ θ) = (φ φ) ⇒ frrr r ′ 2 + (r ′ ′ + r ′ e + 2r ′ m ′ m) Fr + FR L20 - F 2 = 0, (7) for the function r (x) we have R (x) = 2e ′ ′ E +4 m ′ ′ m +2 m ′ 2 m 2 +4e ′ e m ′ m - 2 l20. (8) 58 “Lobachev readings - 2019” If you compose a combination 3 · (7)+ FR · (8) - (4) - (5) −2 · (6) equations (4) - (8), we get R (we get R (we receive R (8) X) - 5 L20 - F 2 FR = 0, (9) This is an equation on the function R (x), the solution of which, if it exists, is constantly. Therefore, r (x) = r0 = const. (10) Having rewritten equations (4)-(8) taking into account (10), we get (t t) ⇒ E ′ ′ E + 2e ′ E m + Fr ∣∣∣ R = R0 = 0, (11) (11) (11) (11) (11) x x) ⇒ E ′ ′ E +2 m ′ ′ M + Fr 2 Fr ∣∣∣ R = R0 = 0, (12) (Y Y) = (Z Z) ⇒ M ′ ′ M + M ′ 2 M 2 + E ′ E m ′ m + f 2 fr ∣∣∣ r = r0 = 0, (13) (θ θ) = (φ φ) ⇒ 1 l20 - f 2 fr ∣∣∣ r = r0 = 0, (14) r0 = 2 E ′ ′ E +4 m ′ ′ m +2 m ′ 2 m 2 +4e ′ e m ′ m - 2 l20, (15) R0 = 5 L20 +Fr 2 FR ∣∣∣ R = R0. (16) from (14) it follows that F 2 FR ∣∣∣ R = R0 = 1 L20. (17) These equations have the following solution l (x) = l0, (18) r (x) = r0 = 6 l20, (19) m (x) 2 = a2 cos4/3 (p 3x 2l0), (20) O.R. Gallamova 59 e (x) 2 = b 2 sin2 (p 3x 2l0) cos2/3 (p 3x 2l0). (21) These expressions together with (17) determine the solution of the task. Moreover, (17) gives a restriction on the function f (r) in which the decision under consideration is possible. In the case of f (r) = ar2 +r +c (22) this restriction can be recorded in this way C L40 +4 L20 +12 A = 0, (23) that determines the radius of the additional space L20 =   −3
