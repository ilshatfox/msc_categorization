The curvature of distributed group connectedness in the space of projective connectedness of O. M. Omelian Russian State University named after I. Kant, Kaliningrad, Olesya@epc.albertina.ru Consider the space of projective connectedness of the Cartan PN, N with structural equations [1, 2], which generalize the corresponding equations of the space of affinated connectedness. In 113 of the space of projective connectedness, the distribution of the NSN M-Merged planes is examined. This distribution gives rise to a number of shades of twisting and crivene tensor <= {sijk, <ijkl, <ijk} (i, j, k, l = 1, n). With the distribution, the main stratification G (NSN) is associated with the distribution, in which 4 factors. In the stratification of G (NSN), the method of G. F. Laptev sets the distributed [3] group connectivity γ using the form ω̃ = ω - γiωi - γaωa, where ω = (ωij, ωi, ω a b, ω a i, ωa) (I, I, I, I, j, k = 1, m, a, b = m + 1, n). Expression for external differentials, for example, the component ωij, which determine the planar linear connectivity in the factor of linear reperns, have the form of: dω̃ij = ω̃ k j ∧ ω̃ik + rijklωk ∧ ωl + r̂ijka ∧ijakω a ∧ ωk + rijabωa ∧ ωb. (1) Object {rijkl, r̂ijka, řijak, rijab} We will call an uninitiated object of curvature of planar linear connectedness {γijk, γija}. Of the differential comparisons for the component of the unintended object of curvature r̂ coherence γ, the theorem 1. The uninitiated object of curvature R̂ distributed group connectedness γ in the main stratification G (NSN), associated with the distribution of NSN in the space of projective connectedness PN, N, is not a teenter, but forms geometric The object is only with the given fundamental object of the 2nd order λ2 of the distribution of NSN, the object of connectedness γ and the tensor of twisting-criteria <. Here are in the structural equations (1) similar components dω̃ij = ω̃ k j ∧ ω̃ik + rijklωk ∧ ωl + 2rijkaωk ∧ ωa + rijabωa ∧ ωb; (2) rijka = 1 2 (r̂ijka - řijak) = 1 2 (γijka - γijak - γijbλbka) - 114 γmbes [kγlja] - γijlslka - γijbsbka + <ijka. The object {rijkl, rijka, rijab} will call the given object of curvature of planar linear connectedness. We give such components of form ω components of form component in other expressions for external differentials and find differential comparisons for the component of the given object of curvature R of the connectedness γ, of which the theorem 2. The coded object of the curvature r distributed coherence γ in the stratification G (NSN) is a teenter containing two the simplest and a number of simple shades. Note 1. Theorems similar to theorems 1 and 2, take place in the projective space, where <= 0. Come 2. Our study differs from [4] according to the used apparatus, the considered lords and the technique of their tasks, but in the intersecting places the final results practically match. For example, it is said that the object of curvature {ri jkl} (i, j, k = 0, m), the components of which are calculated by the formula ri jkl = γi j [kl], not including the formula (22), is the tensor that corresponds to the theorem of 2.
