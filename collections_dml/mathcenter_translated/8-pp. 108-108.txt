) The use of integral equations to the construction of Riemann functions in [1], [2], using integral equations, some functions of Riemann are built. In this message, these results are summarized for cases of less restrictive assumptions regarding the coefficients of the initial differential equations. For example, in [1] the specified issue is resolved for the Uxy + Aux + Buy + Cu = 0 equation, when a = A1 (Y) + λx, B = B1 (X) + λ, λ = const. Now it is shown that for A = A (X, Y), B = B (X, Y) the identity of Ax ≡ by. A similar generalization takes place for an equation with three independent variables. In a flat case, reasoning can be extended to the elliptical equation UXX + Uyy + Aux + Buy + Cu = 0 with analytical material coefficients. Here the identity of Ax ≡ by should be replaced by Ay ≡ bx. If at the same time, the LN function (AX + BY + A2 + B2 - 2C) is harmonic, then you can build an analytical function ∗ (Z), Z = X + IY, with which the function of the Riemann is recorded in the form of J0 (∣∣∣ ∫ z t ∗ (perf) dă) exp (∫ z̄ t̄ a (t, η) dη + ∫ z t b (ă, z̄) dial). Here a (z, z̄) = 1 4 [a (z + z̄ 2, z - z̄ 2i) + Ib (z + z̄ 2, z - z̄ 2i)], b (z, z̄) from a (z , z̄) only by the sign before the second component, J0 (ω) - the function of Bessel.
