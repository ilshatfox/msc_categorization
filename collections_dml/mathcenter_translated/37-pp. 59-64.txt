One class of self -like sets in the work [2] introduced the concept of the upper address for the system of iterized functions (SIF). The following set of SIF: ([0, 1], G0, G1), where G0, G1: [0, 1] → [0, 1], G0 (X) = TX, G1 (X), is also considered as an example. = tx + 1 - t, with various t ∈ (0, 1). We denote the attorrator of this siep through AT. Well known that for t ∈ (0, 1/2) AT - Middle Kantorovo many with a compression coefficient T, located on the segment [0, 1], in particular, A1/3 - the classic cantoron. For t ∈ [1/2, 1) a lot of at = [0, 1]. Denote ω def = φ∏ 0 {0, 1} = {ω = ω0ω1ω2. . . | ωj = 0, 1} many endless sequences consisting of zeros and units. We will call ω targeted space. The element ω ∈ ω is called the address of point x ∈ At if x = lim j → φ gω0 ° gω1 · · · ° gωj (0). Simple calculations show that x = (1 - t) ∑icle = 0 ωjtj. Therefore, at = {fω (t) | ω ∈ ω}, where fω (t) def = (1- t) ipp∑ j = 0 ωjt j. 60 If with t ∈ (0, 1/2) the graphs of the functions of Fω (T) do not intersect, that is, the points from the attorrator have the only address, then with t ∈ [1/2, 1) the situation in the root changes (Fig. one). Rice. 1. 150 different schedules of the functions of Fω (t) among all addresses of the point x ∈ at we select the maximum in the lexicographic sense. We will call this address the upper at point t. It should be noted that this design is closely related to the so-called greedy or β-separation (see classical work [6] and [4]), as well as with the infinite bundle of Bernoulli (see classic work [3] and a wonderful review in [5] ). Denote the topτ deg = {t ∈ [0, 1) | τ - the upper address in t}, ωt def = {τ ∈ ω | τ - upper address in t}. Our main goal is to describe these sets. 61 The next theorem allows you to find many values ​​of parameter T, in which the fixed address τ is the upper one. Theorem 1. Let s: ω → ω - transformation of the shift and τ̃ = supk s (τ). We denote T̃ positive root of the equation fτ̃ (t) = 1 - t t. Then topτ = (0, t̃), if the Supremum is achieved, otherwise the topτ = (0, t̃]. Now we fix t ∈ [1/2, 1) and find many upper addresses at this point. Denote ω0t def = {ω ∈ ωt | ω0 = 0} many upper addresses at point T starting from scratch. It is easy to show that ωt = ω 0 T T 1ω0T T 11ω0T · ·. (1) Thus, we can limit ourselves to the consideration of the set ω0t. Theorem 2. Let t ∈ [1/2, 1), then ω0t = {ω ∈ 0ω | SK (ω) <s (ςness) for any k}, where nah is a quasi -top address (see [1]) a point (t, 1– t). We show that many upper addresses are an invoice of self -like sets. As in theorem 2, we denote the quasi -top address of the point (t, 1 - t) through ςness. Consider many finite sequences of zeros and units of the following type: λt def = {{{{{Highlights, 2. . . expers | expense+1 = 1, k ∈ N}, 62 which will be called blocks. For example, for t = (√ 5–1)/2 we have φ = (01) و and λt = {0, 010, 01010, 0101010 ,. . .}. Note that by virtue of the design of quasi -top addresses ∈ 01ω \ {ω = ω0ω1. . . ωk0inger}. Consequently, the λt also contains block 0. The next theorem and its consequences give a complete description of the self -like structure of the set ω0t, which means, by force (1), and the entire space of the upper addresses ωt. Theorem 3. Let ω ∈ ω0T. Then ω = λ0λ1λ2. . ., where λj ∈ λt, and this decomposition is only. Moreover, any infinite sequence of blocks {λj} φj = 0 corresponds to a certain address from ω0t. The investigation 1. The set of ω0t is represented in the form of an accounting disjunctic combination of the sets of the likes like to itself: ω0t = ⊔ λ organt λω0t. As soon as we know the structure of ωt, it will vigorously find Hausdorfov the dimension of the sets associated with it. Investigation 2. Let T0 ∈ [1/2, 1) and t1 ∈ (0, T0]. Then DIMH {FPi (T1) | ω ∈ ωT0} = LN T0 LN T1, where DIMH is the dimension (see Fig. 2). 63 Fig. 2. The many upper addresses at point T0 are interested in comparing the chaotic location of the functions depicted in Fig. 1, with an ordered set in Fig. 2.
