The row of two interpolation functions everywhere in the distance we, without special reservations, will use the basic definitions and designations from the theory of interpolation of linear operators, opira> 1S on LLJ. Let about <in, B1 <1 and FO0, FO 1 - · Interpolarment Finding Types B0, in 1. We denote 11ara, which turns out in the results of the transition from {HO, x1} to {FOU (Ho, X1), FO 1 (Ho, X1)}, through {XGO.111, N 'XFU, 01, N}. Theorem 1. If the norms in the banach pair {Ho, x 1} are equal, then E l/(l-O) 1 · 11 11 LSh x HB0. V 1. PT+need.V1.p, n-too about 1 where a = V (1 - B1) + B1 (1 - V), but E - some KVNSTAIT, not. Theorem 1 11 is in the Nudonomoria steam with: ~ quilsnes to determine the norms of the PS; ~, it. Theorem 2. The F110 * FO collection function, in the service • the type B has a type B, where B = B 1 +V1 26 is a consequence. App. 'Chcjj.f'd Go, q fuilor Lyons -Petr, ~, where about <() <1 :::; TS :::; OO. Like: Southern Black Sea [1], this function has a type (}. Then PO0, Q * PO 1, Q == PO, Q, where 80 <81, A () VU'Chus is on the theorem 2. Theorem 3. Consider at the subcategory of steam with the equivalet to the norms? .L functor'w Fe0, Fe 1 • Let F; 0, F; ~ - Fuiktikt RT, dual to the FO 0, FO 1 function, respectively. 1 (Ho, X1)* = F00* F01 (x;, XI*), the constant equivalence does not depend on the interNO of lyremi pairs. 13 Conclusion, we note that the function of the collapse of the Aronshaine and Ga. Ayardo can be expanded to the category of all Banachskiy steam. Literature 1. Berg J., LEFTREME J. Interniolation of space. Introduction. - MIR, 1980. 264 pp. N. S.
