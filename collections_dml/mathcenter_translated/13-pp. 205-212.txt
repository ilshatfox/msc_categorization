Rastorguev Institute of Natural Sciences and Ecology, Moscow 1 Introduction Filtration of liquid in an unsaturated porous environment is described by a nonlinear parabolic equation proposed in the 30s of the last century by Richards [2]. The Richards equation is intended for solving problems related to: 1. Environmental protection (predictions of the spread of pollution); 2. Hydrotechnics (filtration through layers); 3. Civil construction (flooding and drainage of the foundations and basements of buildings); 4. Agriculture (irrigation and drainage of agricultural fields). In addition, the Richards equation is close to the tasks of multi -phase filtration, for example, it can be considered as a special case of a two -phase model at a pressure in the gas phase equal to atmospheric. Until now, the use of Richards equation was limited for two reasons: 205 calculation of filtration equations with sustainable obvious methods 1. Insufficient information about empirical parameters that connect the sucking pressure with the moisture content of the soil of soil and its permeability; 2. The nonlinearity of these parameters requires detailed sampling in time and space for numerical models. The first difficulty associated with parametric security, through the efforts of researchers from the United States under the leadership of Van Genuchten [1], has recently been overcome. On the pages of his USSL laboratory on the Internet, statistics are given about the capillary properties of soils and a program is presented for determining the capillary properties of soils by indirect signs (granulometric composition of rocks). They try to overcome the second difficulty using different schemes and 1. Non -linear iteration methods (Newton's method, as well as the method described in the article [3]); 2. Multiprocessor computers and multi -section algorithms [4]; 3. Neural computers [5]. Given the above, the use of obvious variable schemes that do not require iterations implemented in the program of V.I. is of interest. Lebedeva Dumka [7, 8, 10]. Below is a comparison of the solution for the problem of unsaturated filtration using the Dumka program and the US SWMS_2D program [6], which implements an implicit scheme. 2 The setting of the problem Richards Equation, describing the balance of moisture in the volume of the porous medium, the pores of which are not completely saturated with water, rewritten for pressure, are usually as follows: C (θ (h)) ∂ ∂t h (x, y, z, t) = ∇ (k (θ (h) ∇h) + ∂ ∂z k (x, y, z, θ (h)), (2.1) 206 I.A. Rastorguev where K is the filtration coefficient in an unsaturated porous section de [l/t]; Z is a vertical coordinate directed opposite to the strength of severity [l]; t - time [t]; h - pressure determined by the height of the water column [l]; C - specific humidity, C (h) = ∂θ (h) ∂h; h = p ρg. (2.2) It is convenient to rewrite the Richards equation through the pressure h = h+z: ∂h ∂t = 1 c (h) ∂ ∂z (k (θ) ∂h ∂z). (2.3) The relationship of moisture with pressure is determined by the empirical equation of the state proposed by van Genuchten [1]. Mummy θ (h) is expressed as follows: θ (h) =   θr + θs - θr (1 + | αh | n) m, h <0 θr, h ≥ 0, (2.4) where θr is the residual humidity, θS - humidity of complete saturation - value determined by the characteristics of the environment; a, n, m = 1–1/n - constant values. The function k (θ) is determined in the form of k (θ) = {kss 1 2 (1 - (1 - s 1m) 2, h <0 ks, h ≥ 0, (2.5) s = θ (h) - θr θs - θr, where KS is the filtration coefficient when full saturation. The equation (3) was solved by the final differences with the obvious approximation of the temporary derivative performed by the Dumka program, for the task of Koshi with the initial conditions and parameters θr = 0.102, θs = 0.368, ks = 0.00922 cm/s, a = 0.0335; column height 100 cm; The boundary conditions H (0) = −75 cm, h (100) = 207 calculation of the filtration equations with stable obvious methods of −1000 cm. The variable scheme with variable nonlinear coefficients is as follows: hi = hi + zi; θi = θr + θs - θr (1 + | αhi | n) m; CI = mN (θs - θr) | α | n | hi | n - 1 (1 + | αhi | n) m + 1; Si = θi - θr θs - θr; Ki = kss 1 2 i (1 - (1 - s 1 m i) M) 2; (2.6) ki+1 2 = ki+1+ki 2, ki - 1 2 = ki+ki - 1 2, ht+∆ti —hti ∆t = 1 ci ki+1 2 (hi+1 - hi) −ki - 1 2 (hi - hi - 1) ∆x2 = fi. All variables and parameters without the upper index correspond to the previous temporary step T. A step in time ∆t and a change in solution are considered a special way in the Dumka program [7, 8, 10]. To evaluate the step by time, a value is calculated, characterizing stability and determining the minimum step in time for these values ​​of the coefficients - chimes (COU). To evaluate the chimes (COU), the following actions are performed: jij = ∂ (fn) i ∂hj, λ = min (max I | ∑ jij |, max j | ∑ i jij |), (2.7) cu = 1/λ. The Jacobi J matrix has a three -dyagonal structure, but it will be enough to use the sum of the modules of derivatives for the horizontal component of the matrix to calculate the chimes. 208 I.A.
