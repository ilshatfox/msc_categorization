Lobachevsky 2 rarumyantsev@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in this work with the help of a generalized discrete transformation of Fourier is built almost-periodic in the sense of a bore of solving the problems of the airship and Neumann for the semi-space and the spatial layer, the tasks of the free oscillation of the large membrane, the fluctuations of the thin elastic plate, the thermal conductivity in the endless environment in lack of sources. All decisions were obtained in the form of completely converging rows of Fourier, the coefficients of which are expressed through the specified functions. Keywords: generalized discrete transformation of Fourier, the task of the airship, the task of the Neumann, the semi -space, the spatial layer, the fluctuations, the thermal conductivity. In the works [1]- [3] using OPF, introduced and studied in [4] and [5], almost-periodic solutions to some problems of mathematical physics are built for the functions of two variables, that is, flat tasks. In this work, almost-periodic in the sense of boron of solving the problems of the airship and Neumann for the semi-space and the spatial layer, the tasks of the free oscillation of the large membrane, the fluctuations of the thin elastic plate, thermal conductivity in an endless environment in the absence of sources. The solution of these problems, but in other classes of functions, is given in almost all textbooks and textbooks in mathematical physics. We will say that f (x, y) ∈∏W, if f (x, y) = f0 + ∑ µ µ2 + λ2 ̸ = 0 F adigns λxeiµy and {fλµ} ∈ L1. If the sequence {fλµ (z)} is such that exists {aλµ} such that | fλµ (z) | ≤ aλµ, we will say that φ (x, y, z) = ∑ λ, µ fλ, µ (z) e iλxeiµy ∈ ∏z w is the task for the layer to find the function φ (x, y, z) ∈∏zw, which: 1. defined and continuous in the layer 0 ≤ z ≤ h; 2. Satisfies the equation of Laplace △ φ = 0 in 0 <z <h; 3. Satisfies the conditions φ (x, y, z) | z = 0 = f (x, y), φ (x, y, z) | z = h = g (x, y) on the borders. 222 Materials of the International School-Conference If F (X, Y) ∈ ∏W and G (X, Y) ∈ ∏W, then the only solution to this problem is given by the formula φ (x, y, z) = f0 + g0-f0 h z + ∑ µ2 +λ2 ̸ = 0 (gλµ enz —NZ ENH —ERNH - fλµ EN (z --h) —D - n (z --h) enH —D - n) eiλxeiµy where n = √ µ2 +λ2 +λ2 +λ2 +λ2 +λ2 +λ2 . The task of the conductor for the semi -space is also considered. The task of the Neumann for the semi -space must be found the function φ (x, y, z) ∈∏zw, which: 1. Determined and continuous in z ≥ 0; 2. Satisfies the equation of Laplace △ φ = 0 in Z> 0; 3. The derivative takes on the border the specified values: ∂φ (x, y, z) ∂z | z = 0 = f (x, y). To solve the problem of Neumann, it is necessary that F0 = 0. Then the solution φ (x, y, z) evenly striving to zero by x and y at z →+ger is given by the formula: φ (x, y, t) = - ∑ µ2+ λ2 ̸ = 0 1 n fλ −nzeiλxeiµy, where n = √ µ2 +λ2. The task of thermal conductivity in an infinite environment must be found the function of changes in temperature q (x, y, t), which satisfies the initial condition Q (x, y, z) | t = 0 = f (x, y) ∈ ∏ W and the differential equation ∂ Q ∂t = υ △ 1Q, where △ 1 is Laplace operator on X and Y, υ - thermal conductivity. The solution to the problem in the class ∏T W is given by the formula Q (x, y, t) = f0 +∑ µ µ2 +λ2 ̸ = 0 fλ t eiλxeiµy, where l = υ (µ2 +λ2). The task of free fluctuations in a very large membrane. The displacement of the membrane is z = z (x, y, t) in the case of free vibrations is described by the equation: M.F. Kulagina, R.A. Rumyantsev 223 1 C2 ∂2Z ∂T 2 = △ 1Z with the initial conditions Z (x, y, t) | t = 0 = f (x, y), ∂z∂t | t = 0 = g (x, y) . In the equation △ 1 - Laplace operator on X and Y. If f (x, y) ∈ ∏w and g (x, y) ∈ ∏W, then the only solution to this problem is given by the formula: z (x, y, t) = ∑ µ2+λ2 ̸ = 0 (fλµcos (mt) + gλµ sin (mt)) eiλxeiµy, where M = C √ µ2 + λ2 ≥α> 0. The task of free vibrations of a thin elastic plate. Here, to determine the displacement ω = ω (x, y, t) points (x, y), it is necessary to solve the equation: D (∂2 ∂x2 + ∂ 2 ∂y2) 2 ω + 2ρH∂ 2ω ∂T 2 = 0 with the initial conditions ω (x, y, t) | t = 0 = f (x, y), ω∂t | t = 0 = g (x, y). Through D, the coefficient of stiffness of the plate is indicated, which is associated with the Yung E module and the Poisson coefficient σ with the formula d = 2eh2 3 (1–σ2), the hu-lane of the plate. If f (x, y) ∈∏w and g (x, y) ∈∏W, then the only solution to this problem of the class ∏tw is given by the formula: ω (x, y, t) = ∑ µ2+λ2 ̸ = 0 (fλµcos (kt) + 1 k gλµ sin (kt)) e iλxeiiµy, where k = (µ2 + λ2) √ d 2ph ≥α> 0. As a rule, all these problems are solved by converting Fourier, and their solutions are recorded as integrals Fourier, which causes great computational difficulties. In this work, all solutions of problems were obtained in the form of completely converging rows of Fourier, the coefficients of which are expressed through the given functions. Literature 1.
