Applying the theory of covering display to the study of the economic and mathematical models N.G. Pavlova1 1 Natasharussia@mail.ru; Russian University of Friendship of Peoples in the work investigates the existence of equilibrium vector in a competitive balance model. In the model under consideration, the demand function was obtained as a solution to the problem of maximizing the function of utility at budgetary restrictions, and the function of the proposal as a solution to the problem of maximizing profits taking into account transaction losses on the technological set. The work provides sufficient conditions for the existence of the equilibrium price vector, which are obtained by the investigation about the existence of points of coincidence of the lipsitz and covering the display. Key words: economic balance, transaction costs, points of coincidence. The results of the theory of covering display, in particular, theorems on the existence of points of coincidence of the covering and lipsitz display can be used to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of the equilibrium position in the “demand” models. In this work, the issue of the existence of a vector of equilibrium prices in a competitive equilibrium model was investigated, which take into account transaction costs associated with the sale of products. Unlike work [1], in the considered model of the share of transaction costs for various types of products, generally speaking, are different. Formalize the task. Consider the metric spaces X and Y with the metrics ρx and ρy, respectively. The closed ball in space X with the center at the point X Radius R will be designated through bx (x, r), and the closed ball in space Y with the center at point y radius r is through by (y, r). Determination 1 (see [2]). Let α> 0. Display D: X → Y is called α-torn if D (bx (x, r)) ⊇ by (D (x), αR) ∀R ≥ 0 ∀x ∈ X. Theorem 1 (see [2]). Let the space x is full, and d, s: x → y are arbitrary display, the first of which is continuously and is α-opening, and the second satisfies the condition of the lips with the lips of the lips of β <α. Then, for arbitrary x0 ∈ X, there is such lection = lection (x0) ∈ X, that D (ă) = s (hole), (1) ρx (x0, ₽) ≤ ρy (d (x0), s (x0)) α --β. The solution of the hole equation (1) may not be the only one. This decision hole is called the point of coincidence of the display D and S. Using theorem 1, we can explore 288 materials of the International School-Conference The issue of the existence of equilibrium in the “Demanding” models, in particular, it is possible to obtain sufficient conditions for the equilibrium vector in the model of economic balance. With transaction costs. Consider models of behavior of manufacturers and consumers. Let it have n ∈N of goods, and the I product for the consumer has the price Pi> 0, I = 1, N. Suppose that the prices are P̃ = (p̃1, p̃2,., P̃n), by which the manufacturer sells goods, less prices p = (p1, p2,., PN) that the consumer pays for them, and p̃ = AP, where A = (AI J), αI J ∈ (0; 1) ∀I, J = 1, N. The manufacturer’s production capabilities are described by the technological set T ⊂ R2N+, T = {Y = (Y+; Y -) | onic (Y+; Y-) ≤ 0, Y+, Y - ∈RN+}, where wor: R2N+ → R - twice continuously differentiated and a strongly convex function, y - = (y - 1, y - 2,., y - n) - cost vector, and y+= (y+1, y+2,., y+n) - The corresponding vector of releases (y+i ∈ R+, i = 1, n, is the gross output of I -I -I, y --i ∈ R+, I = 1, N, -the volume of the I -product used in the production of the 1st products in the volume of Y+1, 2nd products in the volume of Y+2,., N-th products in the volume of Y+N). In the production process, all n types of resources are used. Of all the possible production processes, the manufacturer selects the one in which the profit is maximum. Thus, the choice of the manufacturer is reduced to the problem of finding the conditional extremum of the profit function:  〈〈〈〈〈〈〈〈–p), (y+; y -)〉 → max, ∗ (y+; y-) ≤ 0, (y+; y-- )> 0. (2) Let y ∗ = (y ∗+, y ∗ -) - solution to the problem (2). Then the proposal of the manufacturer of the i -th product si (p) = y ∗+ -y ∗ -, i = 1, n. Consumer preferences of the consumer with budget I (P) are set by the utility function U: rn+ → R, which is twice continuously differentiated, strictly concave and does not have maximums. Function I: Rn+ → R+ is a differentiated positively uniform first degree, in addition, there is a number C> 0, such as I (p) ≥c || p || for any p ∈Rn+. Suppose that the consumer acquires all the types of goods, moreover, by purchasing a set of goods y = (y1, y2,., Yn) ∈ Rn+, the consumer acquires Y1 of the 1st product, Y2 of units of the 2nd product, .. ., yn of units of the N-th product, the choice of consumer is reduced to the problem of finding a conditional extremum of the utility function: u (y) → max, 〈p, y ≤ ≤ i (p), y> 0. The consumer demand is set by the display D: Rn+ → Rn+ , D (p) = argmax {u (y) | y ∈Rn+, 〈p, y〉 ≤ i (p)}. Consider a model of economic equilibrium described by a set of data σ = (a, onic, u, i, c1, c2), where a = (αi j), αi j ∈ (0.1) ∀i, j = 1, n are specified numbers, wor: r2n+ → r - twice continuously differentiated,
