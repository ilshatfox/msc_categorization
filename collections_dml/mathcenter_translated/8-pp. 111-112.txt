) The construction of almost-periodic solutions of the first regional problem of the theory of elasticity for an area consisting of a strip and half-plate area consisting of a homogeneous-izotropic elastic strip (y ∈ [—h; 0], h> 0, −mm <x <mm) and The same semi -plate (y ∈ [0; +و), – fine <x < +و) is located in equilibrium. On the direct connection of y = 0, the conditions of rigid adhesion are set: u (1) (x, 0) = u (2) (x, 0), v (1) (x, 0) = v (2) (x, 0) , σ (1) y (x, 0) = σ (2) y (x, 0), τ (1) xy (x, 0) = τ (2) xy (x, 0). On the straight line y = −h, the boundary conditions of the 1st kind are set: σ (1) y (x,-h) = f (x), τ (1) xy (x,-h) = g (x). It is required to find stress functions σ (j) x (x, y), σ (j) y (x, y), τ (j) xy (x, y), j = 1, 2, and movements u (j) (j) ( x, y), v (j) (x, y) in a given area. The solution to the problem is built in the space of almost-periodic functions in the sense of boron with the help of a generalized discrete 111 transformation of Fourier [1], [2]. The desired functions are presented in the form of the converging rows of Fourier, the indicators of which, generally speaking, are not natural.

Ivanov (Cheboksary) Integral equations of the periodic problem of connecting elastic plates into the package along the curves considered the task of determining the stress state of the package of thin elastic plates E1, E2, ... EN, interconnected along the periodic system of open curves L., the plates occupy the plates occupy The entire complex plane is stretched by the efforts attached to them at infinity. Mathematically the task is to find 2n of the piece-head-somerfic functions φk (z), ψk (z) with a line of rupture l according to the specified boundary conditions that express the equality of displacements and the equilibrium of the line of the line L. function φk (z) are periodic, and ψk (z) ) Satisfy the condition ψk (z + t0) = ψk (z) –t0φ′k (z), where T0 is the location of the curves. At the ends of the strip of periods 0 ≤ re (z) ≤ t0, the functions φk (z), ψk (z) have behavior determined by the specified efforts of the NU fine, and at the ends of the connection line they can have features of the integrated nature.
