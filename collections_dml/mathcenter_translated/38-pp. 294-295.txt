Khromova Saratov, khromvvap@info.sgu.ru The choice of the regulatory parameter when solving the equations of the first kind considers the equation of the first kind of ai = f, (1) where A is a linear limited operator operating in the BAS space, L -1 exists , but unlimited, the right part was set by approximately: 11/a - FLL ~ 8; and the family of the opera Rators (2) corresponding to the method of M. M. Lavrentiev [1]. In the classical setting of this method, it is assumed that A = A*> O, and it is proved that in this case, the families are regulatory for the equation (1). Let now A - an arbitrary linear limited operator. In [2], the conditions for operator A are given and the exact decision and, necessary and sufficient for convergence: lltaf -Ill ---> about __ __, about. Suppose these conditions are fulfilled. We apply TN operators to f about. M. century. Tsalyuk 295 Theorem. For this, 'chmobi d (o, those, and) = sup {lltcxfo -Ill: llfo -fll ~ o ___.
