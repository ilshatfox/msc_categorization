Chepanov Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University, Kazan, Fun@hitv.ru Let E ++ 2-the first quadrant of the coordinate plane OXT, D = {( x, t) ∈ E ++ 2 ∣∣ 0 <x <l, t> 0}, d̃ = {(x, t) ∈ E ++ 2 ∣∣ 0 <x <l, t> 0}.

(5) To find a solution to the problem (1) - (5), we will consider recalling the Mogent problem: to find the function satisfying the condition of VIM (1) - (3) and the boundary condition U (L, T) = υ (t), t> 0. (6) Solution of the problem (1) - (3), (6) obtained using the Fourier method, has the form U (x, t) = υ (t)+ ger∑ n = 1 [an cos (µnt/l) + Bn sin (µnt/l)] x –βJJ ( , (7) where the coefficients are an, BN, fn (t) are determined by the known formulas, β = (k - 1)/2. In the expression (7) the parameters µn, n = 1, 2, 3,. . . are the roots of the equations Jux (µ) = 0, such that µ1 <µ2 <· · · <µn <.. . . Expression (7) contains an unknown function υ (t). To find it, we apply to the resulting decision (7) integral condition (4). After some calculations, we get that the unknown function υ (t) satisfies the integral equation type F (t) = βυ (t) + t∫ 0 υ (τ) ipp∑ n = 1 sin (t - τ)/l ) µn dτ. (8) 218
