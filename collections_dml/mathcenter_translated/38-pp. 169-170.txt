The stability of integro-radio equations is studied by the stability of the trivial solution of systems t t. x '= ah+/ k (t-s) x (s) ds+f (t, x (t))+.!

In addition, the solution of equation (2) satisfies the beginning of the .. x (t) = h. (T) at t e [-t; O], where h (t) is a well -known continuous vector -function. We denote the transformation of the nucleus to the transformation of the laplass K (z) through the i single matrix. Let f. SUP/ SUP LLG (T, S, X) L/ DS = O (R), R-+O. (3) t llxl/~ t o theorem 1.
