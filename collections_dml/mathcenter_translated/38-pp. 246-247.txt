The monotonous functionality of the single -link area, let the single -link area on the plane, and (x, y) solution of the Poisson equation 6i = -2 with a boundary condition and = o, u (n) = SUP U (Z, P). Consider the functionality ZE! L Wr (P) = 2P J Ju (Z, DN) PDXDY. N with p = 1 we get the classic functionality of the area P (P), called the rigidity of the torsion. One of the most important and well -known inequalities for the stiffness of twisting is the inequality of Saint -Venan - Polya, which connects the area of ​​the coat and rigidity of the twisting. L. E. Payne proved that in the action of the rightness; 1 is more powerful inequality [1] A2 (С - 27g (С ~ (a (С — С С СО) 2, where a (n) is the area of ​​the region. queue, we show that the classic Payne inequality is a consequence of another isoperim of the funous property - isperimetric monotony by the parameter. We build a new functionality f () = 1 (w (p) -7 g (2i (b) p+1) p. · (2и(Щ)Р- 1 Р р+ 1 ·   Теорема. Пустъ П - односвязная область и Wр0 (П) <  < +оо для некоторого р0 Е [-1 , оо) . Тогда:     Э .

The property of the functionality F (P), described in the theorem, is called the property of isperimetric monotony according to the paramet of the river river. For the first time, the functionality with this property was built by M. T. Kekhler-Jobin, J. Hersh and K. Bandle (see . [2]). The consequence of the theorem is the inequality f (o) ~ f (l) that falls with inequality Payne, it is obvious that the theorem takes advantage of the various strengthening of this inequality. The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFI (about the ECT No. 08-01-00381). Literature 1. Bandle S.
