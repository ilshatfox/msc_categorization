Sultanov ****Kazan State University, Kazan, OJSC, OJSC “SMP-Neftegaz”, Almetyevsk, *** Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N. G. Chebotarev Kazan State University, Kazan, work is devoted to the conclusion of variations describing the process of deforming the porous matrix of complex physical nature at various stages of development of oil products, in particular, at the stage of earthwork, when taking into account filtration consolidation. The process of extraction of viscous carbon is almost always associated with the presence of water in the collector, so the liquid fraction will be the oil mixture. With a macro -cutting description of the filtration of such a mixture, it can be assumed that the pore pressure of oil and water coincides. We will not consider the presence of gas. Consider the case of quasistatic deformation when inertial terms can be neglected. To describe the deformation process, a combined lagranzhevo-elevation setting is used. The behavior of the material point (elementary volume) is monitored in accordance with the Lagran method of describing the environment, and at the current moment in the time the deformation process is the course of the environment with some physical and mechanical properties. This corresponds to the approach of Euler, widely used in the mechanics of solid media. 1 The main equations the tense state is described by the total stresses σtotij, and according to the principle of Terzagi stresses, the total stresses in the soil are taken equal to σtotij = σ EF IJ-δijp, 95 Lagranzhe-Elerovo description of the process. . . Where P is the pressure in the liquid phase, σ EF IJ is effective stress in the ground. We write the equilibrium equation for the soil in general ∂σtotij ∂xj + ρgδi3 = 0, (1.1) where ρ = m (s ρW + (1– S) ρN) + (1–M) ρS is the manurated density of the collector rock, ~ g = g = g ~ i3 - acceleration of free fall, XI - Global decartial coordinates of the current (current) state, ~ II - ORTs of the Global Cartesian Coordinates, Indexes S, W, N, N, ALLECTIONS OF THE SHILE OF THE SUPPLE, WATER AND OF OILS, through M and S indicated respectively. and water content in the liquid phase. We write down the equations of the balance of the masses separately for each soil phase. For the skeleton of the soil, the equation of the mass balance will take the form ∂ ∂t {(1 --m) ρs} + div {(1 —m) ρs υ υS} = 0, (1.2) where ~ υS is the speed of the soil skeleton. The equations of the balance of masses for liquid phases will accept a similar type of water ∂ ∂t {msρw} + div {msρw υ υW} = 0 (1.3) and for oil ∂ ∂t {m (1 - s) ρ n} + div {m (m (m (m (m (m (ms. 1 - s) ρ n ~ υn} = 0, (1.4) where ~ υW and ~ υN - the speed of particles of water and oil, respectively. Having divided the equation of the balance of the solid phase by ρs, we convert the equation (1.2) to the species ∂ ∂t (1 −m) + (1 −m) 1 ρρs ∂t + div {(1 --m) ~ υs} = 0. (1.5) Similar transformations of equations (1.3) and (1.4) will lead to equations ∂ ∂t (MS) + ms 1 ∂ρw ∂t + div {ms ~ υW} = 0 (1.6) 96 D.V. Berezhnoye, and . I. Golovanov, S. M. Sabaev, L. W. Sultanov and ∂ ∂t {m (1 - s)} + m (1 - s) 1 ρ n ∂ρ n ∂t + div {m (1 - 1 - 1 - s) ~ υN} = 0. (1.7) by folding the ratio (1.5), (1.6) and (1.7) and neglecting the density gradient compared to gradients of speed and porosity, after some transformations we get (1 —M) 1 ρs ∂ρS ∂t + ms 1 ρρw ∂t + m (1 - s) 1 ρn ∂ρn ∂t + div {~ υs} + div {ms (~ υW - ~ imes) + div {m (1 - s. ) (~ υN - ~ υS)} = 0. (1.8) Considering that the volumetric deformations of the mineral particles of the soil skeleton are determined by the pressure of the liquid phase, and taking into account their weak compressibility, the law of compressibility for the mineral particles of the skeleton of the soil we write down in the form of 1 ρs ∂ρS ∂ t = 1 ks ∂p ∂t, where ks - The module of volumetric compression of the mineral particles of the soil skeleton. Given the weak compressibility of water and oil, we can get the following ratios: 1 ρW ∂ρw ∂t = 1 kw ∂p ∂P, 1 ρ n ∂ρS ∂t = 1 k n ∂p ∂t, where kW and k are modules of volumetric compression modules water and oil, respectively. Then the equation (1.8) will take the form β ∂p ∂t + div ~ υs + div {ms (~ υW - υ imes) + DIV {m (1 - S) (~ υN - ~ υS)} = 0, where β = (1 −m)/ks +ms/kw +m (1 - s)/k - the overshed elasticity of the entire soil as a whole. In the projections, the final equation of the mass balance can be written in the form of β ∂p ∂t + ∂imesi ∂xi + ∂ {ms (υWI - υSI) ∂xi + ∂ {m (1 - s) (υNI - υSI)} ∂xi = 0. 97 Lagranzhevo-Eilero description of the process. . . The filtration law is recorded in relation to the difference in the above fluid speeds and the soil skeleton in the form of Darsi - Gersevanova MS (~ υW - ~ υS) = - k µW fw (grad p - ρW ~ g), a similar equation for oil will take the form M (1 - s) (~ υN - υ υS) = - k µ n f n (grad p - ρ n ~ g), where k is the absolute permeability of the soil skeleton, µW - the viscosity of the water, µ n - the viscosity of oil, fz - the phase permeability of the system Channels engaged in water, f n is the phase permeability of the channels engaged in oil. By substituting the filtration equation in the final equation of the balance of the mass, we get the Equation Piezopro
