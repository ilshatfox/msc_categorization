Tsiolkovsky in the article is given an algorithm for the solution of the third type of thermal conductivity formulated in the most general form for the multilayer environment. Based on this algorithm, the method of solving the problem of finding the coordinates of the phase boundary in one of the layers under general conditions on external borders is described. Key words: matrix method, thermal conductivity equation, multilayer environment, phase transition. Multilayer materials in the form of plates, shells, screens find more and more use in construction and equipment. They are exposed to external thermal influences and are often in extreme conditions. The study of thermal modes in the multilayer shell allows you to predict the behavior of individual layers and identify the conditions for the possibility of deformation, melting and other changes in the physical or chemical nature of individual layers. To do this, you need to have good calculating methods that allow you to predict possible undesirable phenomena. As such a method, the matrix method that we proposed in a number of works is suitable in a number of works, using the apparatus of generalized degrees of Bers [5], [6]. Let the multilayer environment consists of n flat, suspicimimetric or layers with central symmetry. We will direct the X axis perpendicular to the boundaries of the layers, the coordinates of which are denoted by X1, X2, ..., XN+1, and X1 and XN+1 - the boundaries of the entire layer system. Consider the stationary one -dimensional process of the heat transfer directed along the X axis and described by the system of equations d d x (λ (i) (x) xp dt (i) d x) = 0, XI <x <xi+1, n = 1, n, (1) and the conditions for coordination at the boundaries of contact of the layers t (i) (xi+1) = t (i+1) (XI+1), (2) λ (I) (XI+1) dt (i) d x ∣∣∣∣ XI+1 = λ (i+1) (xi+1) dt (i+1) d x ∣∣∣∣ xi+1. (3) Here T (I) and λ (i)-respectively, the temperature and coefficient of thermal conductivity in the I-th layer. The XP multiplier takes into account the possible curvatures of the layer: p = 0 corresponds to the flat layers, p = 1 - with cooked hollow cylindrical shells, p = 2 - concentric hollow spherical shells. The layer number coincides with the number of its smaller coordinate. Yu.A. Gladyshev, V.V. Kalmanovich 115 Stream in the i-th layer j (i) (x) = − (i) xp dt (i) d x. (4) On the external boundaries of the layer system, we set the conditions of the third type M1T (1) (x1)+n1 j (1) (x1) = TVN (x1), (5) m2t (n) (xn+1)+n2 j ( n) (xn+1) = tvn (xn+1). (6) Further, to solve the problem, the matrix method was used together with the apparatus of generalized degrees of Bers. Enter matrix v (1) (x1) = (t (1) (x1) j (1) (x1)), v (i) (x) = (t (i) (x) j (i) (x) ), (7) VVN (x1) = (TVN (x1) JVN (x1)), VVN (xn+1) = (TVN (xn+1) JVN (xn+1)), (8) l = (m1 N1 0 1), R = (M2 N2 0 1), (9) K (I, ..., 1) (X, X1) =   1 - (XI (X, XI)+ I -1∑ j = 1 x j (x j+1, x j) 0 1  , (10) where the functions of the type XI (X, XI), x J (x j+1, x J) are generalized degrees of Bersa, and them The amount in the matrix to a physical point of view represents the sum of thermal resistance of the sequentially connected layers. The solution for the i-th layer has the form V (I) (x) = k (I, ..., 1) (x, x1) v (x1), XI <x <xi+1. (11) The output of formula (11) is presented in [1]. Moreover, according to the boundary conditions (5) and (6), VVN (x1) = LV (1) (x1), VVN (xn+1) = RV (n) (xn+1), (12) where will we get VVN (12) xn+1) = rk (n, ..., 1) (x, x1) L -1VVN (x1). (13) Thus, a system of two linear equations is obtained, connecting TVN (x1), TVN (xn+1), JVN (x1), JVN (xn+1), and by any known pair of these values, the values ​​can be determined by the values Another unknown couple. For example, if TVN (x1), TVN (XN+1) are known, then from (13) you can find JVN (x1), JVN (xn+1). Formulas (11), (13) make it possible to find a point of possible phase transition. If we assume that the phase transition point XF is in the I-th layer, then this layer by point XF is divided into a model into two layers. Thus, the number of layers in the system increases to n +1. Having overthrown the layers in connection with this, we get that the desired point of the phase transition will be XI+1, and the last point is XN+2. We solve the resulting problem according to the proposed algorithm, and since it is fair at 116 materials of the school-conference of any final number of layers, by applying it, we get a solution to the regional problem, expressed through the unknown parameter XF = XI+1. Then we find the value of the XF point at the temperature of the phase transition TF, that is, from the equation T (XI+1) = TF. According to the general theory of behavior of the solution of a homogeneous system type (1), the desired point XF, provided that TV (x1) <tf <tv (xn+1), there is and the only one. The further stage of the solution is a mathematical study whether this point lies in the interval (XI, XI+1). Under the simplest boundary conditions, this problem was solved in [7].
