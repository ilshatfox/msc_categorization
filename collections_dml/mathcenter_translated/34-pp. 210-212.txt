The diffraction of electromagnetic waves on the branching in a flat waveguard filled with anisotropic dielectric K. R. Khadiev Kazan State University, kamilhadi@gmail.com is the task of diffraction of electromagnetic waves on the branching of a flat -waved, a zetropic dielectric, which is a cold plasma. The anisotropy of the environment is manifested as follows: dielectric permeability ε =  ε ε1 0 —Iε2 0 ε3 0 iε2 0 ε1  , while the magnetic permeability of µ = 1. The properties of the waves of the waveguide are the same as in the isotropic case, the anisotropy manifests itself When considering TM waves. When solving the Helmholtz equation, the component in the field of the field at ε̂ = (ε21 - ε22) ex = −1 ωε0ε̂ (ε2 ∂x + iε1 ∂ ∂z) Hy (X, Z), EZ = 1 ωε0ε̂ ( - ε2 ∂Z + ∂Z + iε1 ∂ ∂x) Hy (x, z). Here Hy = ∑ αa + αxαe −αx, where α is its own values, and xα is own functions. For own functions, the condition is not fulfilled, but the condition of the biralonality of 212 ∫ h 0 is fulfilled ((ε2x ′ α - ε1αxα) xβ + (ε2x ′ β - ε1βxβ) = = {0, α 6 = β nα = const 6 = Constance 6 = Constance 6 = Constance 6 = Constance 6 = Constance 6 = Constance 6 = Constance 6 = Const 0, α = β. We introduce the following designations h (x, 0) = h (x), ex (x, 0) = = e (x), ez (x, 0) = Q (x), then equality are true: h (x) = ∑ α aαXα (x), e (x) = - 1 ωε0ε̂ ∑ α aαyα, q (x) = - 1 ωε0ε̂ ∑ α aαqα. Using the condition of bioponiality, it is possible to obtain the condition of the condition of Aβ = 1 nβ ∫ h 0 (h (x) yβ (x) + e (x) ( - ωε0ε̂) xβ (x)) dx. When stitching the parts of the waveguide, the following equations are obtained by the parts of the tangent components of the vectors d = ε0εe and b = µ0h: ε1e a (x) + ε2q a (x) + ε1e 0 (x) + ε2q 0 (x) = {ε1e B (x) + ε2q b (x), ε1e c (x) + ε2q c (x), where h0 (x), e0 (x), q0 (x) are functions corresponding to the spreading wave. BLLAU was obtained regarding the coefficients of Aα, which is solved by truncation. 213 L and T R A T R A 1. R. Mittra, S. Lee, Analytical methods of the theory of the Volodov. - M.: Mir, 1974.

Katz [1], proven in [3] for p> 3. This one. The theorem gives a description of the graduated algebris L = ⊕R I = −Q LI, where L0 is the direct sum of the classic algebris Li, L-1 is an ignorant L0-module, the negative part is born L and 1 and the condition of transitivity is fulfilled: if x ∈ Li, I> 0, x 6 = 0, then [x, l - 1] 6 = 0. In the case of p = 3, the recognition theorem is proved in [2] for q = 1. In this work, the graduated algebras of the characteristics 3 with the local part L -1 +L0 +L1, where L0 is SL (2) or GL (2). In the Algebr Lee class, generated by the local part, there is the only minimum algebra, which is the algebra factor of the algebra Lee generated by forming L -1+L0+L1 and the ratios that are performed in the local part, according to the only maximum degree ideal, which has a trivial The intersection with the local hour. The following results were obtained. Theorem. Let l - the endedly graduated algebra Lee over the algebraically closed field characteristics of 214
