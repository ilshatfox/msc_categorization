. The dual tasks of linear programming and their approximation R. Sh. Mukhutdinov Kazan State University, pnb@ksu.ru Let K - the field of material numbers, x and x ′ - linear spaces over K. If non -equal bilinear functionality is <x, x ′> on X × x ′ with values ​​in K, then the spaces of X and X ′ are dual [1]. Let A: X → Y - linear operator, x, x ′ and y, y ′ - vapors of dual spaces. Operator A ′: Y ′ → X ′ is called dual to A if <x, a′y ′> = <ax, y ′> ∀x ∈ X, ∀y ′ ∈ Y ′. In linear programming, it is more convenient to use another definition. Operator A ′: Y → X ′ will call dual to A if <x, a′y> = <y, AX> ∀X ∈ X, ∀Y ERRO Y. Let X, X ′, Y, Y ′ - ordered linear spaces. Moreover, the orderlies in them are agreed: if x ′ ≥ 0, then <x, x ′> ≥ 0 ∀x ∈ P+X (p+x is a positive cone in x). 104 We will use the terminology adopted in work [2]. Let the spaces X, Y approximate the spaces X, Y and X ′, Y ′ - spaces dual to X, Y. In the future, natural approximation of spaces and operators will be considered. Lemma 1. If the operators TX and SX have dual, then the space X ′ approximates the space X ′. Lemma 2. If the operator A ′ exists, then he approaches the operator A ′. Lemma 3. If a ′ = a ′, then (a 0) ′ = (a ′) 0. Consider a couple of tasks of linear programming in the abstract setting - direct and dual: <x, x′0> → max, AX ≤ Y′0, X ≥ 0, (1) <Y, y′0> → Min, A′y ≥ X′0, Y ≥ 0. (2) Let the task (1) approximates the task <x, s’sx ′ 0> → max, ty ′ asxx ≤ ty ′ y′0, x ≥ 0. (3) theorem 1. The task, dual to the task (3), approaches the dual task (2) (with natural approximation).

Neberov NIMMM Kazan State University is still relevant, the problem of optimizing the form of classical wing profiles in the potential stream of the ideal inconspicuous fluid. The work considers the task of constructing non -streamlined wing profiles, which selected the profiles of Zhukovsky and Clark’a. The essence of the task is as follows. Let there be a wing profile streamlined in a certain range of attack angles [α1, α2]. It is necessary to ensure a non -flowing stream of profile with a slightly larger angle of attack α3> α2, α3 = = α2+∆α. We call the angle α3 calculated. Having solved the direct regional task of aerohydrodynamics during the calculated angle of attack, we will make sure that the profile is stuck with the separation of the flow. To build unexceptably streamlined wing profiles, two approaches are used: a straight line that consists in changing the profile shape, and the opposite, which consists in such a modification of speed distribution along the contour of the profile, so that the aerodynamic characteristics change minimally. It was the second approach that was used below. In the process of modification, the theory of reverse edge tasks of aerohydrodynamics was used [1]; The viscosity was taken into account according to the model of the border layer, for the calculation of which the integral method of Kochin - Loitsyansky was used [2, § 112]; The stiff stir was guaranteed by the implementation of the criterion of the uncleaning of L. G. Loitsyansky. Thus, a new wing profile was built, streamlined without the separation of the flow already in more than 106
