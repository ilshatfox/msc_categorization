Resonance cases for the system of two related dumwing equations for the system of two weakly connected substantially non-linear Duffing equations-van der fields, the most convenient type of three-dimensional shortened system for research, describing the behavior of solutions in unused resonance cases. The calculation of the right parts of a shortened system leads to the calculation of integrals from the elliptical functions of Jacobi. Using the decomposition of these functions in the rows of Fourier is a three -dimensional system, the right parts of which are presented in the form of rapidly converging rows. By allocating the main components in these ranks, the desired system is obtained. The work was supported by the RFFF, project 06-01-00270. 87
