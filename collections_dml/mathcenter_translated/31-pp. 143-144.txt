. The generalized collocation method for one class of integrated equations of the third kind of S. A. Solovyov Naberezhnye Chelny considers the integral equation of the third kind with general assumptions relative to zeros of the coefficient: AX ≡ UX + KX (x ∈ X, Y ∈ Y), (1) where ux ≡ where ux ≡ tp1 (1- t) p2 q∏ j = 1 (t - tj) mj x (t), kx ≡ 1∫ 0 k (t, s) x (s) ds; t ∈ 143 [0, 1], p1, p2 ∈ R+, tj ∈ (0; 1), mj ∈ N, (j = 1; q), y ≡ c {p1, p2; m, τ} and y ≡ and y ≡ V {p1, p2; m, τ} - the spaces of basic and generalized functions, respectively (see, e.g., [1]). Here the initial data are these: k (t, s) ∈ C {p1, p2; m, τ} ([0; 1] 2), ∗ji (s) ≡ k {i} t (tj, s), ψji (tji ) ≡ k {i} s (t, tj) ∈ Y (i = 0, mj - 1, j = 1, q + 2), θ (t, s) = (ttk) (t, s) ∈ Ys, Where t: y → c [0, 1] is a “characteristic” class y (see, e.g., [1]), y ∈ Y, and x ∈ X is the desired element. The approximate solution of the equation (1) is sought in the form of xn (t) ≡ n - 1∑ k = 0 ckt k + q + 2∑ j = 1 mj - 1 j = 0 cji tµ1 (1– t) µ2 (t - tj ) I+1. (2) Unknown coefficients ck ≡ c (n) k, k = 0, n - 1, cji (i = 0, mj - 1, j = 1, q + 2) are from the system of linear algebraic equations (Axn - Y) {i} (tj) = 0, i = 0, mj - 1, j = 1, Q + 2, (TAXN - TY) (νK) = 0, K = 1, N, (3) where νK (K = 1, n)-the nodes of Chebyshev 1st or 2nd genus. For the computing scheme (1) - (3) the theorem 1. Let the conditions are fulfilled: (i) equation (1) is unambiguously permitted with any right part Y ∈ Y; (ii) h (t, s) ≡ (tsθ) (t, s) (t), gji (t) ≡ θ {i} s (t, tj) (i = 0, mj - 1, j = 1 , Q + 2), (TY) (t) belongs to the class of dini - lips. 144
