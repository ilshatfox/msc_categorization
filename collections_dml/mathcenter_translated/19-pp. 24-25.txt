In many inequalities, with extreme functions, the trigonometric Polino is being:-. 1y (see "eg" [1], [2]), but in in This case takes place with, a derivative of the theorem. If equality is achieved in inequality (L) with some of the <b <27 g, then the extreme function is not evident I am a trigonometric polynoma. The work is supported by the program:-.
