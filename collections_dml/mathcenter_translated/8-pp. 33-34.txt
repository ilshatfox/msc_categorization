) Antipromoxyminal sets in direct works of spaces Determination. A non -empty closed subset A 6 = X of the material banner space X is called antiprofyminal if there is no nearest point for any point x \ A in the set A. We denote through V (x), s (x) - single closed ball 33 and the sphere of banakh space x, x# = {f ∈ X ∗: ∃x ∈ V (x) f (x) = sup {f (z): z) ∈ V (x)}}. Let x, y - banakh space, z = x × y - a direct work of spaces X and Y, on which the norm is determined, satisfying the following conditions: ∀x ∈ X, ∀y ∈ Y, max (‖x‖x, ‖y‖ Y)/c ≤ ‖ (x, y) ‖z ≤ c max (‖x‖x, ‖y‖y), where C> 0 is some constant (see [1], p. 103). Definition. Banah this space z = x × y satisfies the condition (p1) (we will write z ∈ (p1)), if from the ratios f ∈ X \ x#, g ∈ S (y ∗) it follows that (f, g) ∈ Z ∗ \ Z#. In [2] it is proven that in the space of continuous functions C (Q), where Q is an endless bicompact, there is a limited closed convex antiprotoxymal body. This result is generalized as follows. Theorem. Let q - bikopakk, x = c (q), dim x = inous, y - banakh space, z = x × y - direct work of spaces x and y, z ∈ (p1). Then, in the space of Z, there is a limited closed convex antiproxy body M.
