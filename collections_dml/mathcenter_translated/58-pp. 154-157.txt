"Lobachev readings - 2019" UDC 517.958 Computer modeling of laser radiation by photon -critical resonator A.I. Repina1 1 annirepina@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, the Institute of Night Mathematics and Information Technologies in this work solves the task of its own values ​​for active micro -zone of round shape with a periodic set of through holes. Namely, a new formulation of the problem for photon-critical resonators in the form of a nonlinear task for its own values ​​for the system of boundary integral equations, convenient for a numerical solution is proposed. A new computer implementation of the Galerkin method is proposed and spectral characteristics of photon-critical resonators are calculated, which have low radiation generation thresholds and spectrum of spectrum. Keywords: micro -native laser, task for its own meanings, active micro -Rusonator, boundary integral equations, the Galerkin method will consider the geometry of the resonator with an arbitrary number of non -certificate periodic round holes inside (see Fig. 2). Suppose that the areas ωl, l = 2, ..., n, on the plane R2 are limited by the contours γl, l = 2, ..., n. Similarly, the area ωn+1 is limited by n+1 contour: γ1, ..., γn, and γn+1. In this case, the external region is defined as ωo = r2 \ ⋃n+1 l = 1 ωn+1. We define all the contours of γl as a circumference, and the refractive indicator as a piece-set function. In the nucleus ωn+1, the refractive indicator is νn+1 = αn+1 - γ, in the holes and in the unlimited region, the refractive indicator is the actual number ν = αo, l = 1.2, ..., n, and νo = αo. Rice. 1. The geometry of a photon-critical resonator is required (see, for example, [1]) to find unknown thresholds of generation of laser radiation γ> 0 and the values ​​of the wave number K> 0, which are given by non-trivial A.I. Repin 155 Solutions of the Helmholtz equations △ u +k2l u = 0, x ∈ωl, l = 1, ..., n, n +1, o, (1) satisfying along with U -firing conditions u - = u +, x ∈ γl , l = 1, ..., n, n +1, (2) ηl ∂u - ∂rl = ηn+1 ∂u+∂rl, x ∈ γl, l = 1, ..., n, ηn+1 ∂U - ∂RN+1 = ηO ∂U+∂RN+1, x ∈ γn+1, (3) and the condition of the radiation radiation at the infinity ∂u ∂r - i ku = o (1p r), r → ∞. (4) Here u is the comprehensive function that describes the amplitude of the micro-native of the micro-nerd, kl = kνl, l = 1, ..., n, n +1, o, in the case of h-polyarization u = h3, ηl = ν-2l, ∂u ∂rl is a normal derivative to the contour γl, directed from the inside of the area ωl. The fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz equations (1) can be represented as GL (K, γ; X, Y) = i4 H (1) 0 (KL | X - Y |). We use the analytical regulatory method [2], using the representation of our own functions U in the ωn+1 region (in other areas of the representation are similar): u (x) = n∑ l = 1 ∫ γl (u+(y) ∂gn+1 (x , y) ∂rl (y) —Gn+1 (x, y) ∂u+(y) ∂rl (y)) dl (y) - ∫ γn+1 (u - (y) ∂gn+1 (x, y) ∂RN+1 (y) −GN+1 (x, y) ∂U - (y) ∂RN+1 (y)) dl (y), x ∈rapa+1, we build a system of boundary integral equations, which Satisfies its own functions of the task (1)-(4). We set up new functions, following the conditions of conjugation (2), (3): UL (x) = u + (x) = u - (x), x ∈ γl, l = 1, ..., n + 1, vl (x ) = ηl+ηn+12] ∂u+(x) ∂rl (x) = ηl+ηn+12ηn+1 ∂u - (x) ∂rl (x), x ∈ γl, l = 1, ..., n , vn+1 (x) = ηo+ηn+12 type+1 ∂u+(x) ∂rn+1 (x) = ηo+ηn+1 2 op - (x) ∂rn+1 (x), x ∈ Γn+1. Applying the conditions (2), (3), we will reduce the initial task (1)-(4) to the nonlinear spectacular task for the system of integral equations of Muller (see, e.g., [2], [3]). Here is one equation of this system: ul (x)+l - 1∑ k = 1 ∫ γk (uk (y) k 2l-1, k (x, y)+vk (y) k 2l-1, k+1 (x, y)) dl (y) + ∫ γl ul (y) k 2l-1,2l - 1 (x, y) dl (y) + γ γl (y) k 2l-1,2l (x, y) dl (y)+ n∑ k = l+ 1 γ γk (uk (y) k 2l - 1,2k --l (x, y)+ vk (y) k 2l - 1,2k (x, y) ) DL (y) 156 “Lobachev readings - 2019”+∫ γn+1 (un+1 (y) k 2l-1,2n+1 (x, y)+vn+1 (y) k2l-1.2 ( n+1) (x, y)) dl (y) = 0, x ∈ γl, l = 1, ..., n, (5) where the nuclei are continuous or slobsingular (see [2]), for example, for example, for example. K 2l-1.2l - 1 (x, y) = ∂gl (x, y) ∂rl (y) ∂GN+1 (x, y) ∂rl (y), k 2l-1,2l (x y) = 2 op ηl+ηn+1 gn+1 (x, y) - 2] 1 ηl+ηn+1 gl (x, y), k 2l, 2l - 1 (x, y) = ∂ 2gl (x , y) ∂rl (x) ∂rl (y) − ∂ 2gn+1 (x, y) ∂rl (x) ∂rl (y), k 2l, 2l (x, y) = 2 opal+ηn+1 ∂GN+1 (x, y) ∂RL (x) - 2] 1 ηl+ηn+1 ∂gl (x, y) ∂rl (x), where k, l = 1, ..., n. We use the Galerkin method to find numerical approaches of the tasks (5). We select a system of linearly independent trigonometric functions in order to find close solutions in the form of wor (t l l) = n∑ k = −n onic (l) k ei kt l l, ψl (t l l) = n∑ k = −n ψ (l) k ei KT L L, where l = 1, ..., n + 1, t l l ∈ [0.2π] and {ei kt ll} - trigonometric base. After the representation of the equation (5) and similar to it in the local coordinate systems of each circle, following [3], we use the graph formulas for the functions of Hankel. Finally, we get a nonlinear formulation of the task for our own values ​​in the matrix form  a1.1. . . A1.2 (
