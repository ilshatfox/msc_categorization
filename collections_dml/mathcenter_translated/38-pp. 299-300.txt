Regional tasks for one singular degenerating B-elliptical equation 299 Let in:+-part XP> o, xr-1> about the r-s-eclidic space of points x "= (x 1, x2,., XP-2), x = (x ", xr-1, xp), n-the final region in B;+ 'limited hyper-top g and parts of GO and g 1 hyperploster X-1 = O and XP = O, respectively, p = c;-+ \ (P u d). Consider the main regional tasks for the singular you are born B-elliptical equation where P-2 2 d lx "= l d 2 'x · .i = l j a2 k a bzv-1 = -d 2 +---- D-xr- ~ KH-1 KH-1- operator of Bessel, K> O, o, <1- constant, p ~ 3.
