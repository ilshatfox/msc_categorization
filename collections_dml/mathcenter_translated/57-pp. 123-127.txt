We give a general method of constructing extensions, each of which is generated by one element, and examples of these extensions for the additive half -group of non -negative integers. The main discussed result is the following statement: a reduced half-group C ∗ algebra for the above expansion is a topologically zn-graded. Keywords: half-group with reduction, expansion of half-groups, a group of deductions by module N, accurate sequence, fella stratification, normal expansion generated by one element, graduated with ∗-albubra, reduced half-group C ∗-albur, half-group of non-negative integers, topologically degreed c. ∗ -algebra. The report is dedicated to the reduced half-group C ∗-albram for the normal extensions of the Abelic half-groups using the additive group of deductions according to the module N. All considered half -groups with reduction and units. Reduced semi-group C ∗-algebras were studied by authors in a series of work, see, for example, [1–7]. Studies associated with the construction of a topological graduation are continued by previously begun studies of graduated half-group C ∗-algebr in [1, 8, 9]. Let S and L - additive aboles of half -groups with reduction and units, and Zn = Z/NZ - Additative group of deductions according to the module N. Consider the normal expansion of L half -group S using the Zn group, that is, a short exact sequence: 0 - - → S τ - - - → l σ - - - → zn - - - → 0, where τ: S - → l is the inexpected homomorphism of half -groups, and σ: l - → zn - surconcetic homomorphism, such that σ–1 ([0] n) = τ (s), where [0] n is the unit of the Zn group. In this 124 materials of the school-conference of the case, there is isomorphism ψ: l/ ∼-→ zn, where ∼ is a conspiracy specified on l with σ: x ∼ y, if only σ (x) = σ (y). The expansion of L will be called the normal expansion of the half group S generated by one element, if the half -group L is generated by many τ (S) and a fixed element x ∈ψ -1 ([1] n), where [1] n is the generating element of the Zn group. We prove that if L is the final normal expansion of the semi -group S, generated by an element X, then each element Y ∈ L clearly appears in the form y = τ (A)+KX, where a ∈ S, 0 ≤ K ≤ N −1. This means that the half -group L is presented in the form of a disjunct association l = τ (s) ⊔ (τ (s)+ x) ⊔ ... ⊔ (τ (s)+ (n −1) x), where τ (s) +kx: = {τ (a)+kx | a ∈ S}, 0 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. Moreover, nx ∈ τ (s), that is, there is an element b ∈ S such that in the half -group L is the equality of nx = τ (b). (1) We give a method by which it is possible to build the final normal extensions of half groups, in which equation is permitted (1). Example. Let S = Z+ - a half -group of non -negative integers. Then, for any natural numbers N and M, there is a final normal expansion of LN, m of the zero z+, in which the equation Nx = τ (M) has a solution. That is, there is a short accurate sequence of half -groups and their homomorphisms: 0 - - - → z+ τ - - → ln, m σ - - → zn - - - → 0. The underground in Z+ with the final addition we call a perforated one . We have proved the following result: the half -group LN, m isomorphic perforated half -group and only when the numbers N and M are mutually simple. Consider the standard guilbert space of complex -digit functions on the half -group L: l 2 (l): = {f: l → c | ∑ yorn | f (y) | 2 <+φ}. The canonical orthonomated basis of the Gilbertov space L 2 (L) will designate {Ey | y ∈ L}, where ey (y ′) = 1, if y = y ′, and ey (y ′) = 0, if y ̸ = y ′. Through C ∗ R (l), we denote C ∗ -dalgebra in the algebra of all limited line operators on L 2 (L), generated by many isometers {TY | y ∈ L}, where TY (EY ′) = Ey+Y ′. Algebra C ∗ R (l) is called a reduced half-group ∗-algebra for half-group L. Elements y ∈ L have the type Y = τ (A)+KX, where a ∈ S, K ∈N, 0 ≤ K ≤ N −1. Obviously, type = tτ (a)+kx = tτ (a) t kx. S.A. Grigoryan, R.N. Gumerov, E.V. Lipacheva 125 Thus, C ∗-Algebra C ∗ R (L) is generated by many isometers {tτ (A) | a ∈ S} and the isometric operator TX. A direct consequence of equality (1) is the operator equality t nx = tτ (b). Found
