Harmonic displays on R-convered areas S.Yu. Graph1 1 sergey.graf@tversu.ru; Tver State University, Petrozavodsk State University in the report discusses the conditions of the R-spaces of the image of the circle with the orientation of single-leafful harmonic display. Estimates of the coefficients of single-leaf harmonic displays to R-conquered areas are given. Keywords: harmonic display, R-conjure areas. For this pair of points w1, w2 ∈ C are such as | w1 −W2 | ≤ 2R, 0 <r <و, we determine the R-convergular shell ER (W1, W2) as a compact set limited by the two shortest arcs of the circles R with terminal points W1, W2. Determination. Mnism a ⊂C is called R-conver, if A contains ropy shells ER (W1, W2) for any pairs of points w1, w2 ∈ A, | w1 −W2 | ≤ 2r. R-conjugate sets in RN were introduced and studied by E.S. Polinkin and M.V. Balashov in the works [1, 2] and play an important role in the convex analysis and its applications. In the geometric theory of functions by A. Gudman [3], the concept of convex functions of a limited type was independently determined. Analytical local -leaf in a single circle d = {z ∈ C: | z | <1} Function H is called a convex function of a limited type, if liminf | z | → 1 kh (z) ≥ 1/r> 0, where kh (z) = re {zh ′ ′ (z)/h ′ + + + 1}/| zh ′ (z) | - the curvature of the image γr = h (γr) circumference γr = {z ∈ D: | z | = r} When displaying h. Classes of normalized single -leaf analytical convex functions of a limited type were studied in work [3, 4, 5]. The relationship between R-sparkling areas and analytical single-leafing displays in such areas was identified and studied by V.V. Starkov and N.A. Shmelev [6]. In particular, it was proved that for the analytical local-lean function H in D, the area d = h (d) is R-spraying then and only when re {z h ′ ′ (z) h ′ (z) +1} ≥ | zh ′ (Z) | R for all z ∈D. In this message, it is supposed to discuss the properties of harmonic one-leaf displays of the circle D to R-conquered areas. Any harmonic function F B D has the form F = H + G, where h, g are analytical in d and h (z) = ger∑ k = 0 ak z k, g (z) = ger∑ k = 1 bk z k. Function F is a preserving orientation and local-one-leafing in D and only when dilatation ω (z) = g ′ (z)/h ′ (z) display f is analytical in D and | ω (z) | <1 for all z ∈D. Direct calculations are established that the curvature k F (z) Crica 118 Materials of the School-Conference of howh γr = f (γr) at the point f (z) is calculated by the formula K f (z) = 1 | zh ′ (z)-zg ′ (z) | Re {z2h ′ ′ (z)+z2g ′ ′ (z)+2zg ′ (z) zh ′ (z) - zg ′ (z) +1}. Let Dr = {Z ∈ C: | Z | <r}. The next result is a criterion of R-spaces of areas DR = F (DR) at R <1 in terms of curvature of the border ∂D. Theorem 1 [7]. Let F = h+g - preserving orientation harmonic display of the circle d and r ∈ (0.1). The area is DR = F (DR) is R-spraying then and only when re Z2H ′ ′ (Z)+ Z2G ′ ′ (Z)+ ZH ′ (Z)+ ZG ′ (Z) ZH ′-ZG ′ (Z) ≥ | zh ′ (z) - zg ′ (z) | R for all zs such as | z | = r. Naturally, the question arises of whether the R-convergence criterion is true for the case of R = 1, i.e. for the area d = f (d). In general, the answer to this question is negative. Only a sufficient condition for the R-spaces of the area d = f (d): theorem 2 [7] remains true. Let F = h+g-the harmonic display of the circle D. The area d = f (d) is a r-conapal, if liminf | z | → 1 k f (z) ≥ 1 r. Comment. A statement of the opposite to theorem 2 is incorrect. Even in the case of harmonic -preserving orientation of automorphisms of a single circle D, the value of Liminf | z | → 1 k f (z) can be negative. To illustrate this remark, consider the function θ (t) = {2t, with t ∈ (0, π), 0, with t ∈ [−π, 0]. In accordance with the Poisson Poissson integral fio (z) = 1 2π ∫ π 1-| z | 2∣∣ei t-z∣∣2 eiθ (t) d T determines the harmonic autorphism of the circle with the boundary function EIθ (t). The image of the polar grid in D when displayed Fθ is shown in Fig. 1. Note that the images of Fθ (γR) of the ots of γR lose the bulge with sufficiently large R <1. On the right side of Fig. 1 shows the local structure of the Faces (γr) in the vicinity of point 1. by means of the Wolfram Mathematica package, it can be shown that liminf | z | → 1 k f f (z) <0. However, it is obvious that the circle D is a r-conapal area at R = 1. S.Yu. Count 119 Fig. 1. The image of the polar mesh in D when displayed Fθ (left). Loss of convexity by circles Fθ (γR) in the vicinity of point 1 (right). The above example demonstrates that, unlike an analytical case, many single-leaf-harmonic displays of the circle D to R-conap are wider than the family of harmonic convex displays of a limited type (for which liminf | z | → 1 k f (z) ≥ 1R). Let R ∈ (0,+∞) is fixed. Symbol ch, r, we denote the class retaining the orientation of single-leaf-harmonic display of the circle D, for which the area f (d) is R-spray and a0 = a1-1 = 0.
