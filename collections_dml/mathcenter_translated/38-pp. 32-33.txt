Inequalities for the norms of intermediate and mixed derivatives are considered mules of inequalities where k, p - natural numbers, 1 ~ k <p, f (x) - once differentiated function in the region of G, 11 · lil "(G) - the norm in the space of the Lebag, 1 ~ p <oo. The CNK Constants in unequal Svet (1) depend on the type of G. The asymptotic behavior of these constants is obtained at P -> OO and K -> OO for any LP (O, OO). In addition, The lips are appreciated by the estimates of the norms of mixed derivatives through the holes of derivatives for each variable separately for the P-Mind Torah. By example, in the case of a two-dimensional torus T2 m. Baran, c. Klyachin ZZ and functions 1l (x, y) E C00 (T2) and any S, T E N are obtained by the HENTS: LLD ~ TS and (X, Y) JILP (t2) ~ ~ ar (/id; t+2 and (x, y) l1lp (t2) · /Id; s+ 2 and (x, y) i il "(t2)) 112, where p-/; 2 - any of the interval (1, OO), the constant AR depends only on P and NS depends on the function and (x, y). M.V. Baran, V. A. Klyachin: Volgograd, mihellio@mail.ru, klchnv@mail.ru The geometric characteristics of the hexagonal nets and their behavior with quasiizometry, let a set of points RO, P1, P2, RZ, P4, R4@mar PS, located in the area D C R2 and forming a convex hexagon. Consider the function F: D -+ R · Class C 3 (D). Let the values ​​of this function at the points Pi, 'i = O, 5, F (P;) = .Fi. Consider the function of the type G (x, y) = fo + p (x - hu) + q (y - ua) + 1 (2 2) + 2 a (: r - hu) + 2 (3 - hu) ( y - uo) + 1 (y - UO), where RO = (HO, UO). It is clear that G (XO, WA) = Fo =! (Ho, UO). Let the coefficients are selected so that J (p; ) = g (pi), i = o, 5.
