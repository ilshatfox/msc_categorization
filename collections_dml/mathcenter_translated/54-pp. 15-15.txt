Solving the problem of the conductor for single and double areas with the smooth boundaries of A. Elshenavi, E.A. Shirokova in the article discusses a new method of solving a two -dimensional Laplace equation with the boundary conditions of the conductor in the single -link and double -ivated area. The method is based on the reduction of the task to the integral equation of Fredgolm of the second kind and a numerical algorithm is applied, associated with the truncation of the infinite system of linear equations. Keywords: Integral Koshi, Polina Fourier, the task of the conductor, the integral equation of Fredgolm, the single -link region, the double region. UDC 517.98 Continous Atomic System for Subspace A. Fattahi1 1 abdolmajidfattahi@gmail.com; RAZI University, Kermanshah, Iran in this Talk We Give A New Contributions to Atomic Systems Theory in Hilbert Spaces. MORE PRECISILY, We Introduce and Explain the Concept of Continous Atomic Systems for Subspaces, and Give Some Examples to Show Differences Between This and the Discrete Version.
