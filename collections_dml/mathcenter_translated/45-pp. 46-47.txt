The parallel algorithm for solving the integral equation of the problem of diffraction - an approach based on CUDA is devoted to computer modeling of wave processes that arise as a result of the diffraction of electrical waves on obstacles to the “uneven” border (see, for example ”[LJ). Regular tasks simulating fi ~ The process of the process, according to the Helmholtz equation, the regional conditions on the border \ s, formulated in the term .'- :: Elsdov and conditions from a random at infinity (see, e. ; Onania is the method of integrated equations and the technique of generalized potentials. The algorithm of the approximate solution of the problem of the problem is overwhelmed by the Galerkin method (see, e.g., [3]). The report covers the use of NVIDIA CUDA technology to organize highly and 10 -rate calculations (see, nandris. ., [4J).
