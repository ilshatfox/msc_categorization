Periodic generalized convex functions we study the 27g-periodic functions F (x) family, which is determined by the fact that at each interval (a, b) the length of b-a <7g of the functions of this family are sub-U.i function in the sense of e in the sense of .F. Bekkenbach (1]. Generating the functions G1 (X) and 92 (x) are set as linearly independent solutions of the equation of the species in 11 + P (x) U1 + Q (X) Y = O. 155. We solve a number of extreme problems in this family periodic analogue of convex functions. In particular, for 271'-periodic sub-.: \ 1 functions an.ttogi of the neglies of Adamar (of., for example, [2j and the theorems of the Miles [3]. Namely, we prove that .f (a; b) ~ ~ a / f (x) dx ~ f (a); f (b) a under conditions b g, (a) = g; (b) = 2, qi (a; ) = (B ~ a) / 9i (x) dx (i = 1, 2) a and find ~~ points of the minimum of the function b; p (s) = / [j (x) - ts (x)] dx, a Where TS (x) is the supporting function for J (x) at the point S. In addition, we show that in some cases the functions of this family are realized as indicators of the growth of entire solutions of the equation by the underwear.
