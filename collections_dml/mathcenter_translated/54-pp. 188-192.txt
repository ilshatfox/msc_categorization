Materials of the International School-Conference for all critical points f. Dubinin and Sugava [4] proved that there is such a critical point ζ, for which ∣∣∣∣ f (ζ) ζ ∣∣∣∣≥ 1N4N. The hypothesis is easily checked for small values ​​N, however, already starting with N = 4, the check is a complex task that requires long -term reasoning. The proof for n = 4 was represented by a ticer in [3]. The main result of this work is the proof of the dual smaliness hypothesis for cases n = 5 and n = 6. The studies of the first author were conducted with the support of the RFFI (project 1701-00282). Literature 1. Smale S. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and Complexity Theory // Bull. Amer. Math.

Sitdikov3 1 kirillov_math@mail.ru; Kazan State Energy University 2 drnikitin@rambler.ru; Kazan State Energy University 3 airat_vm@rambler.ru; The Kazan State Energy University is given the formulation of a simple algebraic model with the rules of supercurrent for isospinum. The model is tested on a two -widel system and shows that they can be obtained by the related conditions of two nucleons, which can be obtained using a special isometric operator. Keywords: Kuntz algebra, monoidal tensor C ∗ -catoria, dibarion system, isospine, supercarcuric rules. M.I. Kirillov, A.S. Nikitin, A.S. Sitdiks 189 In this paper we offer a simple algebraic model to describe the sparselyclon systems in isotopic space. The model is based on the category of tensor degrees of the Hilbert's space, the basis of which is the isometry ψi (I = 1.2), which satisfy the conditions (1) and (2) and which generate the algebra of the kunts O2 [1]. In these calbert spaces, the representations of the tensor degrees of the SU group (2) are realized, which are indexed using the quantum numbers of isospine {0; 1/2; 1; 3/2; ...} and the rule of the work of objects of the category allows us to describe the addition of isospins and get the appropriate super -collection sectors. We use this model to describe the two -winged system and show that isometric weavers of the operators (elements of the Kuntz algebra), which are not invariant in the action of the Group G, allow you to obtain isotopic charges of sectors from the vacuum sector. The central element in such a model structure is the construction of C ∗-albras of the crossed work a ◃▹t [2]. This algebra contains a as a sub -gubra that remains designated regarding the action of the compact group G, and G is a group of autorphisms of a crossed work. In other words, Group G turns out to be closed by the Auta ◃▹ T group according to Galois-Research [3]. In the case of algebra A with the trivial center CI, the consideration of the crossed work of category T with objects of the type OB jt = {ι, ρ, ρ⊗ρ, ρ⊗ρ⊗ρ, ...} (where ι is identical endomorphism), leads to the algebra of the kunz OD, where D is the dimension ρ. The action G is canonical, and endomorphism ρ algebra A is generated by a fundamental multiple (1), (2). Therefore, C ∗-Dynamic system (A, ρ) can be identified with C ∗-Dynamo system (OG, σG), where OG is a fixaced form of algebra OD regarding the action of G. We will now build a monoidal category of rep (G) of the tensor degrees of the ignorant representation π1 /2 compact group SU (2), the objects of which are OB j rep (g) = {ι, π1/2, (π1/2) ⊗2, (π1/2) ⊗3, ..., (π1/2 ) ⊗R, ..., (π1/2) ⊗s, ...}, where π1/2⊗π1/2 ≡ (π1/2) ⊗2, ...; r, s ∈ N0. Morphisms in this category are wewing operators of such representations. In the physical plane, the binary operation of the “⊗” tensor work in the category corresponds to the vector complex of isospins. As an orthonomated basis of the Hilbertov space HT TZ, where the ignorant representations π1/2 operate, select the multipeter ψi (i = 1.2), which satisfies the ratios ψ ∗ ψ ψ j = δi J i (1) ∑ i ψiψ ∗ i = i. (2) In this case, the elements ψi (i = 1.2), which satisfy the ratios (1) and (2), generate *-algebra 0O2, the replenishment of which forms the algebra of the kunz O2.
