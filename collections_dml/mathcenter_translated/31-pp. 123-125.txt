Symmetry of fundamental objects of the surface in the space of projective connectedness of K.V. Polyakov Russian State University named after I. Kant Kaliningrad, olesya@epc.albertina.ru We determine the space of projective connectedness pn, n with the nm-layers and the N-dimensional base using a system of forms of pfuffa ωi, ωij, ωi (i, j, k = 1,.. with structural equations dωi = ωj ∧ ωij + 1 2 ri0jkω j ∧ ωk, (1) dωij = ω k j ∧ ωik + (δijωk + δikωj) ∧ ωk + 1 2 rijklω k ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ω j ∧ ∧ ωωj + 1 2 rijkω j ∧ ωk. It is shown that the curvature tensor R = {ri0jk, rijkl, rijk} 123 is oblique in the last lower lower indices, contains two shades: the wiping shade {ri0jk} and the affinite curvature tensor [1] {ri0jk, rijkl}. If the space is pn, n without power, i.e. ri0jk = 0, then r I [jkl] = 0. If the affinity-coil tensor is zero, then, by deriving the equations dωij = ω k j ∧ωik + (δijωk + Δikωj) ∧ ∧ ωk, we get (rjklδ i m + δ i jrklm) ω k ∧ ωl ∧ ωm = 0, where rj [klδ i m] + δ i jr [klm] = 0. Write (1) in the form of dωi = ωj ∧ ω ωij, where ωijj is = ωij + 12ri0jkωk, we get dωij = ω k j ∧ωik + ωk ∧ωijk. It has been proved that in the general case, the forms ωijk = - 12ri0jkl piteral - (δijωk + Δikωj) are symmetrical if equal to the continued torsion tensor {ri0jk, ri0jkl}, the differential equations of which are ∆ri0jk ≡ 0, ∆ri0jkl + δi [jrom0k. ] Lωm + 2ri0jkωl ≡ 0 (mod ωi). The surface of XM in the space PN, N is set by equations ωA = 0 (I, J, K = 1, ..., M; a, b, C = m + 1, ..., n), which we receive (ωII + (1/2) r A 0ijular J) ∧ ωi = 0. (2) In this case, the tensor R contains the following shades: {ra0ij}, {ra0ij, ri0jk}, {ra0ij, raijk}, r1 = {ra0ij, ri0jk, Rijk}, {r1, rijkl}, {r1, rijkl, rijk}, {r1, rabij}, {r1, rijkl, rabij, riajk}. Having allowed (2) according to the lem of the cardan, we get ωI + 1 2 Ra0ijω J = λaijular j (λaij = λ a ji), 124 Where is ωai = λ a ijω j, and the components of the fundamental object λ a ij = λ a ij - 12ra0ij in The general case is metric on indexes I, j. If Ra0ij = 0, then λ a ij = λ a ij, that is, λ a ij are symmetrical on lower indices. The components of λaij form a tensor, i.e. ∆λaij = λ a ijkω k, where λaijk = λ a ijk + 1 2 (raijk - λualrl0jk). Pfafovs derivatives λaijk satisfy λai [jk] = 1 2 ( L and T R A T R A 1. Shevchenko yu. Tensor of Affine Torsion-Curvature of Projec Tive Cartan ‘Connection // Ezubr.
