The introduction of a collateral hypothesis (hypothesis 3n+1, Syracuse problem) is one of the unresolved problems of mathematics. Named by the name of German mathematician Lotar Collatus, who formulated this task on July 1, 1932. 38 Materials of the Youth School-Conference This is information from Wikipedia (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%B8%d0%D0%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%D0%d0% B7%D0%B0_%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%86%D0%B0) In the anniversary this year is 85 years old . The problem of enthusiasts, mainly programmers, see http://boinc.thesonntags.com/collatz/. The purpose of our study is simple and naive - to analyze the very mu, and not decades of its discussion. Determination 1. The monument of odd numbers denot1, and many odd numbers, not multiple of 3, are denoted as N3. Determination 2. Function of the collateral k. An odd number N is made in accordance with the correspondence number M, which is obtained from the number of 3n +1 by dividing into the maximum possible degree of number 2. Thus, K: N1 → N1. The collateral hypothesis of any odd number is found in a natural n, that k n (m) = 1. Lemma 1. K (n1) ⊆n3. Obviously, because the first transformation is n � 3n+1 and therefore there can not be multiple 3 in the image. Lemma 2. K (N3) = N3, moreover, each image M ∈N3 has an infinitely many prototypes in N3. Lemma 3. There are arbitrarily long chains confirming the hypothesis of the collateral. Example. For any natural N, it has an equality (2N -1) = 3 · 2N - 1– 1, therefore the length of the chain is up to 1 not less than N. Lemma 4. The prototype k −1 (1) is infinite and consists of numbers {4 n - 1 3 | n ∈N} or in the court of information {1.101,10101,1010101, ...} Formally calculations, the transformation of the collateral multiplies the initial The number is 3, and the division is guaranteed only by 2. Therefore, there is a false feeling that the images of the converting of the collatele can grow to infinity. Lemma 5. The even number is divided on average by 4. In fact, we calculate the average even number to what degree is divided. Each one is divided into 2, i.e. degree 1, each second is still in addition to 2, i.e. 1 2, every fourth is still in addition to 2, this is 1 4, etc. As a result, we get the amount of 1+ 1 2 + 1 4 + ... = 2. Therefore, on average, after converting the collateral, the original number M is multiplied by 3 and is divided by 4, which means it will be equal to 1 approximately through log4/3 (n ) steps. However, in the process of performing the collateral transformations, not all even numbers may occur. Lemma 6. Consider the transformation of the collateral as a display K: N3 - → N3, then only 29 even numbers can appear in the collateral chains. In fact, these are only the numbers of the type 3 (6k + 1) + 1 = 2 (9k + 2) and 3 (6k + 5) + 1 = 2 (9k +8), k ∈N. A. Bolshakova, D. Stepanyan, A.V. Rozhkov 39 however, even even numbers of this species are also divided by 4 and therefore our assessment of the length of the chain as approximately equal to LOG4/3 (N) does not change. The transformation of the collateral is a typical Tsipomarkov, when the next shawl depends only on the previous one. Consider two simplest cases. The first case. Since the first iteration of the collateral transformation sends us inside the set N3, we have only two types of odd numbers with which we need to work - this is 6K +1 and 6k +5, k ∈N. Lemma 7. Let us have two states of the system - this is the number of the type 6k+1 and 6k+5, k ∈N. Then the matrix of the transitions of the Markov process has a form of 1 3 · (1 2 1 2) This is already a matrix of the limiting transitions. At the same time, as follows from Lemma 7, in chains of transitions of the collateral of the number 6k +5, k purpose are twice as often as the number of the type 6k +1, k ∈N. Now we consider the numbers that are the odd numbers according to the module 18. In this case, the set of N3 will be divided into 6 subsets 18K +1.18k +5,18k +7,18k +11,18k +13,18k +17, k ∈N. (1) Lemma 8. Let us have 6 states of the system - this is the number of species (1). The then the Markov process transitions then have the form of 1 63 ·   16 8 4 32 1 2 4 2 1 8 16 32 16 8 4 32 1 2 4 2 1 8 16 32 16 8 4 32 1 2 4 2 4 2 1 8 16 32   This matrix has a characteristic polynomial x6-x5 and Zhordanov's shape of 5 gordan cells - 3 cells with 0, one with 1, and one size 2 × 2, with its own value 0. The second iteration, that is, as erected in a square, the floor matrix becomes a matrix of maximum probabilities -
