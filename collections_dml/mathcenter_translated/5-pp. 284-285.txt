Matveev (Yekaterinburg) Methods of multidimensional interpolation, based on local approximation by polynomas, the task of approximate restoration of the function/ Q ....+R (where L is the limited area in R ", which satisfies the strong condition of the cone) according to the known values ​​of the function F, in the point of arbitrary final set .1. In [1], the following interpolation methods based on the location ... of the proximation by polynomas are proposed: the local modification of the Shepard method; a method based on the use of maced sums of operators; Me Tod based on the decomposition units; of of course element Kon 285
