UDC 517.982 Generalization L1-Polunorm An.N. Novikov1, Z.Sh. Holmatova2 1 A.Hobukob@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky 2 zamira.kholmatova@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky in the work considers a display, which is a generalization of L1-Polunorm associated with operators joined by Algebra von Neumann, and scales determined on the algebra von Neumann. Keywords: ordered vector space, order, non -evidence of integration, duality. Let K - generating cone in the vector space E. The element F of the vector space E will be called positive and write f ≥ 0⃗ if f ∈ K. We will also write f ≥ g if f - g ∈ K. Let the partially ordered vector spaces e and f (c cones of positive elements E+ and F+ respectively) are in duality 〈e, f〉 and are consistent in the sense of the order, i.e., if x ∈ E+, f ∈ F+, then 〈x, f 〉 ≥ 0. Determine p (x, f): = Inf {〈x1 +x2, f1 +f2〉 ∣∣∣∣ x = x1 - x2, x1, x2 ∈ E +f = f1 - f2, f1, f2 purpose F+}. It is obvious that for any x ∈ E, F ∈ F, the inequality p (x, f) ≥ 0. sentence 1. For any λ, µ ∈R, x ∈ E, f ∈ F, equality p (λx, µ f) is performed = | λ || µ | p (x, f). In the event that one of the arguments is positive, then the other argument of the display P (X, ·) and P (·, f) become midnights [1–4]. Sentence 2. If x ∈ E +, then P (X, F) = Inf {(F1 + F2) (x) | F = f1 - f2} for any f ∈ F. Similarly, if f ∈ F+, then p (x, f) = Inf {f (x1)+ f (x2) | x = x1 - x2} for any x ∈ E. An.N. Novikov, Z.Sh. Holmatova 279 However, in the general case, this property of mid -town is not preserved. We also pay attention to the fact that under certain conditions the inequalities of superdaditivity should be carried out. Drying 3. For any X, Y ∈ E+, F ∈ F P P (X+Y, F) ≥ P (X, F)+P (Y, F). Similarly, for arbitrary f, g ∈ F+ and X ∈ E+ the inequality p (x, f+ g) ≥ p (x, f)+ p (x, g) is performed. Consequence 1. For x ∈ E+, f ∈ F+ equality p (x, f) = 〈x, f〉. Consider two examples of how the indicated conking in specific spaces work. Example 1. Let e ​​= l1 (ω, σ, µ), f = lday (ω, σ, µ) are in duality with a natural order (for x ∈ L1 (ω, σ, µ), f ∈ Licle (Ω, σ, µ) The duality is determined by the equality 〈x, f〉 = ´ ω f xdµ). For any x ∈ L1 (ω, σ, µ) and f ∈ Linger (ω, σ, µ) equality p (x, f) = 〈| x |, | F |〉. In this case, for any X, Y ∈ E, F, G ∈ F, the inequalities P (X + Y, F) ≤ P (X, F) + P (Y, F) are true; p (x, f + g) ≤ p (x, f) + p (x, g). Example 2. Let E = F = M2 × 2 (C). We determine the order standard: 0 ≤ a ∈ M2 × 2 (c) if and only when at = a and all its own values ​​A are positive. Duality is determined by the equality Then for a = (2 i −i 2), b = (4 i −i 1), x = (1 0 0 −1) the direct solution of the optimization problem we get that p (a, x) = 2 p 3, p (B, x) = p 21, p (a+b, x) = 9. Thus, p (a+b, x)> p (a, x)+p (b, x). Literature 1. Novikov A.A, Tikhonov O.E., Characterization of Central Elements of Operator Algebras by inqualites // Lobachevskii J.
