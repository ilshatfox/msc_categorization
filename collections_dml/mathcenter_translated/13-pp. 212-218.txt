. Triangular oblique schemes for solving the non-stationary equation of convection-disengage 1 so-called Subbotina Rostov State University, Rostov-on-Don, which was considered in the work, the non-stationary task of convective-diofusive transfer of a substance with dominant convection is a good test example to check the speed of triangular oblique variable schemes and their accuracy of the solution. The dynamic task of convective-dipuse transfer of the substance in the case of two spatial variables can be written in a “symmetrical” form, taking into account the inconsistency of the medium (DIV ~ v = 0) [1]:   ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂                   ip ∂t - 1 pE ∆ accord + 1 2 (∂v1 accord + v1 ∂ç ∂x + ∂v2 accord ∂y + v2 ∂ accord (x, y, t), Сory | t = 0 = ∗0 (x, y), onic | ∂D = ivil, (1) d = [0, 1] × [0, 1]. 1 work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF, project N 00-01 00011 212 so-called Subbotine in equation (1) ~ v = (v1 (x, y), v2 (x, y)) - the vector of the speed of the medium, the first term corresponds to the dynamics of the task, the second term is diffusion transfer, and the rest - convective transfer, f ( X, Y, T) is selected so that the analytical solution of the system (1) is the smooth function lus (x, y) = et sinπx sinπy or a function of the border -layer gment pper (x, y) = (x10 + y10) t. After the approximation of the spatial derivatives of equations (1) on the standard five -point template, where the convective part is approximated by the central differences, we get: b yk+1 - yk τ+ayk = fk+1, k = 0, 1,. . . (2) Here A, B-linear operators (matrices) in h, h-the material final-free hailbert space, f, y0 ∈ H, y0-the initial condition, yk-solution to the problem (1) on the K-m in time, a - a diverse operator in the region of D. Present the matrix A in the form of the sum of the symmetrical and oblique parts: a = a0 +a1, a0 = 0.5 (a +a ∗), a1 = 0.5 (a --a ∗), a1 = kb +kh, where KB and KH are the upper triangular and lower triangular matrices. Let the operator B have one of the following structures: 1. B = BC + 2τKH; 2. B = (1 + α 2 τ) e + τkh, α = ‖m‖, m = a0 + kb −kh; 3. B = (1 + αi 2 τ) e + τkh, αi = n∑ j = 1 | mij |, mij - elements of the matrix m. As shown in [2], the scheme 1 is stable at 0 <τ <1/(γ + 0.5µmin), γ = max i ∑ j | kij |, kij - elements of the matrix A1, µmin = min i µi, µi - own numbers operator A0. Schemes 2 and 3 are absolutely stable [2]. Thanks to the triangular structure of the operator B, the solution in the scheme of ME (2) on (K+1) -t step in time is explicitly expressed and does not require the use of numerical methods of solid SLAU. 213 Triangular oblique solutions. . . Using the selected triangular schemes, four tasks with various speed vectors were solved. The tasks were solved at the time interval t ∈ [0, 20] with a step in time, the increase in which in the case of the application of scheme 1 leads to a loss of stability. For the 2nd and 3rd circuits, given their absolute stability, the step in time is τ = 20. The solutions are obtained on a 32 × 32 grid in space in the following numbers of Peckla: 1. PE = 10–1-dominant diffusion; 2. PE = 10 - average diffusion; 3. PE = 103 - weak diffusion; 4. PE = 105 - dominant convection. Tables 1 - 3 presents the numerical results of the solution of the problem (1): a step in time, time spent on solving the problem on the segment [0, 20], and the relative error of the solution in the norm of space C at the last step in time. Numerical calculations confirmed the theoretical results [2] about the conditional stability of the circuit (2) with b = bc +2τkh (scheme 1) and the absolute stability of the circuit (2) with b = (1 +ατ/2) e +τkh, α = ‖ M‖ (scheme 2) and b = (1 + αiτ/2) e + τkh, αi = n∑ j = 1 | mij | (Scheme 3). Scheme 1 with dominant diffusion is unstable, the age of the influence of convection leads to an increase in the step by time at which the scheme retains stability. Schemes 2 and 3 are absolutely stable regardless of which of the physical processes dominates, and solve the problem for much less time than scheme 1. As expected, the error of solving a problem with a smooth exact solution is much less than in the case of solving a border -layer. With an increase in the number of PE, the accuracy of solving a problem with a smooth solution and with a solution of the type of border layer worsens for all three schemes. Schemes 1 and 3 reach the greatest accuracy on tasks with a speed vector V1 = 1, V2 = −1, and the scheme 2 on the tasks at V1 = X + Y, V2 = X - Y and V1 = Sinπx, v2 = −πy cosπx. The worst accuracy of all three schemes with V1 = 1 - 2X, V2 = 2Y - 1. 214 so -called Subbotina Table 1: Solution of the problem (4) Scheme (2) with b = e + 2τkh vector step by time, classifies. speed of time sec. pogr., Smooth solution 10–1 unstable v1 = 1 10 0.002 329.93 0.18484 v2 = −1 10 3 0.016 41.19 0.01225 105 0.016 41.2 0.89566 10–1 Unstable v1 = 1–2x 10 0.002 336.47 0.68965 v2 = 2Y - 1 10 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0.022 30.49 0.06948 105 0.024 27.91 0.5173 10-1 unstable v1 = x+ y 10 0.002 329.83 1.94027 v2 = x - y 10 3 0.018 36.69 0.15069 105 0.005 131.88 17.2895 10–1 10 0 3 0.005 140.06 14.8075 1
