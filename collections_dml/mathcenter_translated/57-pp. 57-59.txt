УДК 517.958  О ФАКТОРИЗАЦИИ ФУНДАМЕНТАЛЬНОГО РЕШЕНИЯ The fractional and dissection of the Equation of the Helmholtz N.S. Belevtsov1, S.Yu. Lukashchuk2 1 Nikitabelewtsov@mail.ru; Ufa State Aviation Technical University 2 lsu@ugatu.su; Ufim State Aviation Technical University is considered a fractional and differential generalization of the Helmgolian equation with the potential Rice by spatial variable. The statement of the presentation of the foundation has been proved the solution of the equation under consideration through the function of the Fox. The task is set and the main steps of the algorithm for the factorization of the received fundamental decision are given. Key words: Rice potential, fundamental solution, Helmholtz equation. The fractional-disenior generalization of the homogeneous equation of the Helmholtz [1]: ∆rαU ive = 0, u = u (x, y), (x, y) ∈ R2, α ∈ (0.1), (1) where RαU (1) is considered. x, y) = 1 γ (α) φ∫ −ura ughter −mm u (µ, ν) [(x - µ) 2 + (y --ν) 2 --α 2 dµd, γ (α) = 2απγ (α 2) /γ (2–α 2)-the potential of the rice [2], γ (z)-gamma-function. The following statement was proved for equation (1). Approval 1. Fundamal resolution (x, y) of the fractional and radio generalization of the Helmholtz operator ∆Rα-E is the solution of the equation ∆RαGα --Gα = δ (x, y) 58 materials of the school-conference and has the form Gα (X, Y) ≡Gα ≡Gα (r) = H 1231 [(2 r) 2 --α 2 ∣∣∣ (0.1), (0, 2–α2), (0, 2–α2) (0.1)], R = √ X2 + y2, (2) where h mnpq [z ∣∣∣∣ (ap; ap) (bq; bq)] - h - fox fox [4]. In mathematical physics, an important class of tasks is the tasks of factorization of fundamental solutions corresponding to the case when the function of point influence has the type δ (x - 12, y - type). Denote Gα (x –M., y —η) ≡gα (r --r) = gα (z), z = √ r 2 +r2 −2r r cos (θ - ax). To achieve the factorization of the Green's function, we present it in the form of Gα (Z) = ω0 (R, R) 2 + ger∑ M = 0 ωm (r, r) cos (m (θ - pan)). (3) substitution (3) in the fractional and dissection of the Helmholtz equation (1) after a series of transformations leads to the fractional-dissection of the modified equation of the plot (r d dr) 2 lαmωm −m2lαmωm −r2ωm = 0, (4) lαmωm = 2 −αr --m [0i α/2 s m - α/2 s i α/2 φ s −m/2ωm | r = PS] S = R2, where 0iα/2S F (S), S I α/2 ger F f (S) (s)-left-sided and right-sided fractional integrals of Riman-Liwill [2]. It is easy to check that with α = 0, equation (4) passes into a modicified Best equation [3]. The ωm (r) function is a solution to the equation (4), it should be analytical at the beginning of the coordinates and strive for zero at infinity. In R = R, the derivative of the potential of the indicated function should have a rupture of continuity: D Dr Rα (ωm) ∣∣∣ R = R -0 - D Dr Rα (ωm) ∣∣∣ R = R+0 = A R, A = const . (5) The solution to the problem (4), (5) is searched in the form of ωm (r, r) = {am (r) i α m (r), r ≤ r; Bm (r) k α m (r), r ≥ r, where iαm (r), k α m (r) are linearly independent solutions of the fractional and radio generalization of the Best equation (4), such that lim r → ger Kαm ( R) = 0, lim r → 0 iαm (r) = const. The condition of the continuity of the function ωm (r, r) at the point r = r has the form: am (r) i α m (r) −bm (r) kαm (r) = 0. (6) L.A. Bigaeva, I.I. Latypov 59 Solving the system of equations (5), (6), we find the functions AM (R), BM (R). As a result, the factorized decomposition of the function Gα (Z) will take the form Gα (Z) =    a0 (r) i α 0 (r) 2 + ger∑ m = 0 am (r) i α m (R) cos (m (θ - ax)), r ≤ r; B0 (r) k α 0 (r) 2 + φ∑ m = 0 bm (r) k α m (r) cos (m (θ - ax)), r ≥ r.
