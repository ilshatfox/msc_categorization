Accordingly, one of the options for their use is the possibility of predicting various aspects of the personality life activity. In the work as one of the aspects of life activity that can be explored through social networks, the academic success of students is highlighted, which means their achievements at the stage of professional formation in the educational process. In order to search for relationships between the VKontakte social network profile and academic success, data on students of the Kazan (Volga) Federal University studied from 2013 to 2019 according to basic, magistrates and specialties, in the amount of 32581 people, were provided. Information about persons officially expelled or not started to study was deleted from them, as well as those whose age exceeded 30 years. Also, the final analyzed sample did not include students who were studied according to the magistracy program. This was done in order to obtain the most objective assessment of the academic performance of students in relation to each other. The final amount of data on students in the resulting sample amounted to 21631 people. As an indicator of performance, average scores were taken in exams during all semesters of training. For all students under consideration, the minimum rating was 3 points, the maximum - 5 points. In this regard, 15% with the highest points (4.83 - 5.0] were attributed to persons with high academic performance, 15% with the least points [3.0 - 3.53) - to people with low performance, and the rest were included in the group of people with medium academic performance with relevant points of points [3.53 - 4.83]. To analyze information from the VKontakte social network, five profile parameters were selected: the number of friends, subscribers, photographs, videos and interesting pages. This is due to the fact that they are most fully reflected in numerical format. Further, the following statistical indicators were calculated for the entire sample and success groups: average, dispersion, average square, asymmetry, excess. The results are presented in table 1. Where X is the average, D (x) - dispersion, σ is the average deviation, a - asymmetry, E - excess. Summing up, we can say that when analyzing data on students of the Kazan (Volga) Federal University, an assumption of A.A. Vyshinskaya, Z.A. Enikeev, G.Z. Vakhitov 51 Table 1.
