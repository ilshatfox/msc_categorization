UDC 517.958, 530.145.6 Andreevsky reflection in the structure of the P-wave superconductor-Normal metal T.S. Tinyukov1, Yu.P. Chuburin2 1 ttinyukova@mail.ru; Udmurt State University 2 chuburin@udman.ru; The Udmurt Federal Research Center of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences is intermathematically strictly studied by the reflection for Hamiltonianabolov - de wife in the case of a one -dimensional p -wave superconducting structure in the presence of potential. It is proved that at the junction of normal metal and superconductor in the topological phase, there is a complete Andreevsky reflection (i.e., the electron that flows from the side of normal metal is reflected as a hole) regardless of the presence of an impurity. Key words: Hamiltonian Bogolyubov - de wife, spectrum, task of scattering, probability of passage, reflection of Andreev. In the last one and a half decades, in the theory of superconductivity, a new direction has been actively developed related to the theoretical discovery in the superconducting structures of the major localized states (stable quasigrapists with zero energy “Play Plus”, obvious to non -reservoir statistics), which are very promising for future quantum computers [ one]. Andreevsky reflection occurs at the junction of normal (ordinary) metal N and superconductor S. The electron flying from the side can be reflected from S in the usual way, like an electron (normal reflection) with a probability PN, but can also be reflected as a hole (reflection of Andreev) with probability p A = 1 --Pn. With a complete (ideal) Andreevsky reflection P A = 1. Since Mayranov states arise on the border N —S, the question arises of the relationship between them and the St. Andrew's reflection (see, for example, [2]). The work of mathematically strictly studied the reflection of Andreev for Hamiltonian Bogolyubov’s wife in the case of a one -dimensional P -wave superconducting structure in the presence of potential. It is proved that at the junction of normal metal and superconductor, there is a complete Andreevsky reflection regardless of the presence of an impurity. The technique used allows us to describe the own functions of this Hamiltonian for zero energy in order to determine their similarity with major states. Consider gamiltonian for the structure normal metal-P-wave superconductor of the type (h) (n) = (∂2x θ (x) µ+–θ (−x) µ----------∂x-∆2δ ( x) ∆θ (x) ∂x +∆2δ (x) ∂2x +θ (x) µ ++ θ (−x) µ -), T.S. Tinyukova, Yu.P. Chuburin 325 Where θ (X) is the function of Hevisayd. Thus, for x> 0 we have a Hamiltonian of a superconductor, and for X <0 - Hamiltonian of normal metal. In the pulsed representation (after converting the Fourier ̂̂ (p) = 1p 2π ∫ r e —i pxψ (x) d x) we obtain the Hamiltonians of the superconductor and normal metal ĥ+ (p) = (p2 - µ+ −i pions i p violations --p2+ µ +), ĥ - (p) = (p2 - 0 0 −p2 + µ -) (1), respectively. The spectrum H - is equal to (− least, φ), and the spectrum H+ has a lacuna (superconducting gap), symmetrical relative to zero (see [3]). The operator H acts on the pounds of the typeψ (x) = (ψ1 (x), ψ2 (x)) t, where t is transponing, ψ1 (x) describes particles, and ψ2 (x) - holes. Let us now consider Hamiltonian H+V, where v = (v0 (δ (x)+δ (x –A)) 0 0 −v0 (δ (x)+Δ (x –A))) (terms with δ (x) In the potential, contact is characterized, and terms with δ (x --a) - an admixture in the superconductor). We are looking for a solution to the equation (h +v) ψ = eψ for the scattering problem with small E, i.e. For energies in the gap. Of interest are the probability of reflection of an electron flying from the side of normal metal, according to the first and second components, i.e. For particles and holes. Solutions of the equations (h ± –e) ψ ± (x) = 0 are looking in the form of ψ ± (x) = (ψ1 ±, ψ2 ±) t = (a ±, b ±) t eiα ± x, where α ± is the solution Equations Det (ĥ ± (p) —e) = 0, a (a ±, b ±) T satisfies the equality (ĥ, (α ±) –e) (a ±, b ±) t = 0. Found solutions ψ ± (x), depending on arbitrary constants, “glue”, using the equations ψ1+(0+) = ψ1 - (0 -), ψ2+(0+) = ψ2– (0-), (2) 4 (∂xψ 1+1+1+ (0+) - ∂xψ1 - (0 -)) - 2V0 (ψ1+(0+)+ψ1 - (0+))+∆ (ψ2+(0+)+ψ2– (0+)) = 0, (3 ) 4 (∂xψ 2+(0+) - ∂xψ2 - (0 -)) - 2V0 (ψ2+(0+)+ψ2– (0+))+∆ (ψ1+(0+)+ψ1 - (0+ - (0+ - (0+ ))) = 0. (4) here we believe δ (x) · ψ j (x) = 12 (ψ j+(0+)+ψ j - (0 - 0-)), which meets the symmetric races of the impurity position relative to zero. Thus, the functionψ (x) is continuous in zero in accordance with (2), and according to (3), (4) Δ -functions that occur during differentiation of the jump of the first derivative are mutually destroyed with δ - functions that are included in the potential. Andreevsky reflection with “gluing” in zero will consider the case X <0. Suppose that E = Iε (which means the openness of the system) and µ - >> | ε |. From the equality of DET (ĥ - (p) –e) = 0 we get, according to (1), p2 = µ - ± ε.

Next, for brevity, we discard the components of the order O (ε). Given the type of wave function of a flying electron
