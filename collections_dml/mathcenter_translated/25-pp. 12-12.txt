The study of composite intersecting membranes intersecting shells form a special class of verifying structures. Analysis of the intense state of crossing shells is an urgent but poorly studied problem of mechanics. Research tasks for such contrary constructions are both theoretical and practical interest. Based on the theoretical generalization of this problem and for the system analysis of the tense state of the switching shells, some general provisions were formulated, creating the methodological base of the studies. The most common approach in the calculated study of this problem is the use of numerical analysis methods. The work discusses the creation of applied methods for calculating composite intersecting shells using EM MKE. The main structural provisions of this method are as follows: the introduction of a single classification from the unity of the intersecting shells; the use of cream -coordinate systems for individual membranes; Mathematical description of the geometry of the intersection of the shells and obtaining the corresponding to converting the coordinate system on the cross -sectional line of the shells; the use of a rational calculated Al Gestoma, taking into account the specifics of the calculated object; The MKE is accumulated in a modified mixed formulation. A study of the tense state of intersecting membranes of various geometric shapes, co -fixed and with local fortification, with the transitional section was carried out. The parametric analysis is performed, which shows the effect on maximum stresses in the membranes of geometric parameters of the connection, the parameters of local strengthening, structural parameters and elastic characteristics of fibrous compositions. 12
