-Nomotone banakhovs of the couple in the report will discuss the concept of K-monotony, which plays an important role in the theory of interpolation of operators. For a banach pair (x0, x1), x ∈ X0 + X1 and T> 0, we determine the Kofunctional Petra: K (t, x, x0, x1) = Inf {|| x0 || x0 + t || x1 x1: x = x0 + x1, XI ∈ XI}. A pair (x0, x1) is called a monotone (pair of Calderon-Mityagin), if for some C> 0 and all X, Y ∈ X0 + X1 from the inequality K (t, y; x0, x1) ≤ k (t, x; X0, x1) (t> 0) The existence of a linear operator t: x0 + x1 → x0 + x1, such that maxi = 0.1 ‖t‖xi → XI ≤ C and Y = TX. If the latter is made at C = 1, then (X0, X1) is called the exact K-monotone pair. If a pair of K-monotonna, then all the spaces, interpolation relative to it, are described as the spaces of the material K-method. In the mid-60s, A.P. Kalderon [1] and regardless of him B. S. Mityan [2] received the first important example of an accurate K-monotone pair-(L1, Lux). It soon became clear that this property, moreover, has any pair of “weight” LP space (LP0 (W0), LP1 (W1)) (1 ≤ P0, P1 ≤ least) [3]-[5]. 21 Along with this, in the work [3], an example of a pair of dimensional spaces of 3, which does not have the property of accurate monoatitis, was given. Let v = {vi} ni = 1 - non -growing sequence of non -negative numbers (n ∈ N or N = inous). Then the coordinate space of the Lorentz λn (v) consists of all x = (XI) ni = 1, for which ‖x‖v = ∑n i = 1 vix ∗ i <mm ((x ∗ i) - rearrangement (| XI |) ni ni ni ni = 1 in a waning order). The corresponding functional space of the Lorentz λ (∗) (∗ - non -negative increasing concave function on [0, φ), onic (0) = 0) - this is many measurable on (0, φ) functions x = x (t), such, such, such, such that ‖x‖ engations = ∫ φ x ∗ (t) dwor (t) <mm (x ∗ (t) - non -growing rearrangement | x (t) |). The designations ln least and licles are understood in a standard way. The mentioned example of a non-accurate k-monotonic pair is a pair (λ3 (v), l3 least), where V1 = V2 = 1, V3 = 0 [3]. In this regard, A. A. Sedaev raised the question of (accurate) k-monotoneness of pairs of the species (λn (v), lnü) and (λ (С), lday). In 1981, M. Tsvikel proved that any such pair of K-monotonna with Constanta 4 [6], thereby giving a partial positive answer to it. Here are the main results of the report containing the necessary and sufficient conditions of the exact k-monotoneness of pairs of the type (λn (v), ln matter) and (λ (gment), lday)). Theorem 1. Banakhov steam (λn (v), lnü) is an accurate kmonotonon then and only when vk = v1qk - 1 (k = 1, 2, n), where v1>> 0, and q ∈ [ 0, 1]. Theorem 2. The steam (λ (ffic), lip) on the semi-shaft (0, φ) has the property of accurate k-monotonicity and only when onic (t) = AF (t) (A> 0), somewhere f (t) = 1, or f (t) = t, or f (t) = 1 - qt (0 <q <1). The proof of theorem 1 and 2 is based on the description of the many extreme points of the K-orebite VX vector x = (XI) ni = 1 ∈ Rn (x1 ≥ x2 ≥ ... ≥ xn ≥ 0) in a pair (λn (v), lnurb) . This is all 22 y = (yi) ni = 1 ∈ Rn, satisfying the system of inequalities k∑ i = 1 viy ∗ i ≤ k∑ i = 1 vixi, k = 1, 2, .., n. (1) If 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ n (a, b ∈ N), then [a, b] = {k ∈ N: a ≤ k ≤ b}. We call such a gap δ = = a, b] admissible relative to the sequence v = {vi} ni = 1, if either a = b and va 6 = 0, or there is k ∈ δ is that k + 1 ∈ δ and vk> vk +1. Let ∆ = {δk} mk = 1 - the system of permissible gaps, which is the breakdown of the entire segment [1, N], that is, [1, n] = ∪mk = 1δk and δi ∩ ∩ ∅ ∅ (i 6 = j). We denote through e∆ the set of all y = (yi) ni = 1 ∈ Rn such that for all k = 1, 2, .., m y ∗ i = ∑ jorn vjxj∑ jorn vj, i ∈ δk. Theorem 3. The many extreme points of the K-orbit VX, determined by the system of inequalities (1), coincide with ∪∆e∆, where the association is taken by all the breakdown ∆ segment [1, N] to permissible gaps. In the case of V1 = V2 = ... = VN> 0 The only breakdown of the segment [1, N] on the permissible intervals consists of one -element set. We get the well -known theorem of A. S. Marcus: the set of extreme points VX consists of all Y = (yi) ni = 1 ∈ Rn, represented in the form of yi = εixπ (i), where εi = ± 1, and π is the rearrangement of the segment [ 1, n] [7].
