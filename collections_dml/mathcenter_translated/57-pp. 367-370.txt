The best approximation of uniform almost periodic functions of Yu.Kh. Khasanov1 1 yukhas60@mail.ru; The Russian -Tajik (Slavic) University studies the question of the approach of almost periodic functions with whole functions of the final degree with an arbitrary spectrum in a uniform metric. The necessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to uniformly periodic functions to the class of entire functions are also established. Key words: almost periodic functions, rows of Fourier, a spectrum of function, whole functions of the final degree, trigonometric polynomas, the best uniform approximation. Determination of the continuous function on the entire material axis F (x) is called uniformly periodic if for each ε> 0 you can specify such a positive number l = l (ε), which in each interval of length l is at least one number τ, for which Inequality is executed | f (x +τ) - f (x) | <ε (− least <x <mm). The space of uniform almost -periodic functions, we denote it through b, there is a closure of many trigonometric polynomas t (x) = n∑ k = 1 ak Exp (Iλkx), where aK - Fourier coefficients, λk are Fourier (spectrum of functions f (x) ∈ B), with the norm || f (x) || b = sup -ip <x <mm | f (x) |. Consider the class of functions f (x) ∈ B with an arbitrary spectrum {λk}, i.e. functions that have a number of Fourier species f (x) ∼ φ∑ k = −mm ak Exp (Iλkx), where AK = Lim T → → ∫ T ∫ T –T F (X) EXP (—Iord) DX. It is known [1] that for the class of functions f (x) ∈ B, the value of AK can differ from zero no more than on the counting set of spectrum values ​​λ. It is this circumstance that makes it possible to spread the concept of a number of Fourier to the area of ​​almost periodic functions. Through Gσ (σ> 0), we denote a class of limited over the entire axis of entire functions of the degree not higher than σ. Consider the following important issue. Let 368 Materials of the School-Conference give the function F (x) ∈ B. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the belonging of this function to the classroom. To resolve this issue, we will prove the approval, which is previously given by the author in [2] and is used to obtain the main results of this work. Theorem 1. In order for the uniform almost - periodic function F (x) to belong to the classgσ, it is necessary and sufficient for its indicatorsfuria {λk} to satisfy inequality | λk | ≤σ. S.N. Bernstein [3] found that among the functions from class Gσ, carrying out the best uniform approximation of the 2π -periodic function F (X) on the entire actual axis, there is a trigonometric of Polina no higher than σ. The proof is based on the fact that if Gσ (F; X) ∈Gσ and SUP −mm <x <mm | f (x) - gσ (f; x) | = Aσ (f), (1) where aσ (f) is the best uniform approximation of order σ periodic, period 2π, functions through the functions of class Gσ, then evenly in all X (− least <x <mm) the following estimates occur: | f (x) - 1 2n +1 n∑ k = −n gσ (x +2kπ) | ≤ aσ (f), (2) lim n → → 1 2n +1 n∑ k = −n {gσ (x +2kπ +2π) - gσ (x +2kπ)} = 0. (3) note that the above The result of S. N. Bernstein can also be obtained if instead of (2) and (3) use the ratio | φn (x) −qσ, n, n (x) | ≤ aσ (f), where σ> 0; N, n - any natural numbers, φn (x) = 1 π ∫ π −π f (x + t) fn (t) d t = 1 2πn ∫ 2πn −2πn f (x + t) fn (t) d t, qσ N, n (x) = 1 2πn ∫ 2πn −2πn f (x +t) fn (t) d t, fn (t) = sin2 (n +1) t2 2 (n +1) sin2 t2, and with any fixed n evenly in x ∈ (− least, φ) lim n → nder {qσ, n, n (x +2π) −qσ, n, n (x)} = 0. For the first time an analogue of the theorem S.N. Bernstein for functions f (x) ∈ B is found in the works of E.A. Bredikhina [4]-[5]. Using the method of proof of S.N. Bernstein, she found that if the function f (x) ∈ B and has a number of Fourier f (x) ∼ ∑ k ak Exp (Iλkβx), Yu.Kh. Khasanov 369 has Fourier indicators with a maximum point at infinity (see, for example, [6]), then among the functions of Gσ (X) ∈ GL (σ> 0), for which there is an equality (1), there is a trigonometric of polynoma degree not above σ. We formulate the main result of this note, which is also an analogue of S.N. Bernstein for uniform almost periodic functions with arbitrary Fourier indicators {λk} (k = 0, ± 1, ± 2,..). Theorem 2. Let F (x) ∈B and Aσ (F) = SUP −mm <x <mm | f (x) - gσ (f; x) | (σ> 0). Then for any ε> 0 there is the final trigonometric sum piot (x) = n∑ k = 1 bk Exp (Iλk x) (| λk | ≤σ), for which the assessment is evenly valuable | f (x) −pσ (x) | ≤ aσ (f)+ε. S.N. Bernstein (see [3], p. 371-373) proved that for evenly continuity of the limited function F (x) throughout the material axis, it is necessary and sufficient to make the inequality of aσ (f) ≤cω (f) ; 1 σ), (4) where C is a certain absolute constant and ω (f; σ) = sup | x1 - x2 | ≤δ | f (x1) - f (x2) |. The ratio (4) was obtained by the maximum transition at n → φ from the inequality of aσ (f; Δ) ≤ en (f; δ) (σ = n δ), where EN (f; Δ) is the best approximation of the function f (x) by segment [−σ, σ] Polynomas of degree n. Further, for uniform almost periodic functions, we will try to find the function G (x) ∈
