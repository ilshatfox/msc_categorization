. Studying the stability of the rod of step-cross-fingered rigidity of B.F. Kazan State University examines a rod consisting of three links. Extreme parts, each length /1. They have the rigidity of E/1, the middle part. length a = 212, stiffness E/2 â€¢ 1- The total length of the rod. Since the method is taken into account for 139 B.F. Statement of the stability of the stability: NS111Y ... fasteners of the ends of the rod, then differential equations of the curved axis for each part have the 4th order EJ1 v..n ' +PV1II = 0, EJ2VJL' +PV {1 = 0. The boundary conditions at the ends and at points of the mating have the form DV1 DV2 V1 = 0 Proch 1 = 0, V1 = V2 PROX1 = 11 of them 2 = 0,-=-PROX1 = 11 their2 = 0. DX1 DX2 will write static boundary conditions for the moments and transit forces and symmetry conditions V2 (0) = V2 (2/2), V2 (/2) = 0. Given the kinematic and static boundary conditions of the shaping, the transcendental equation K 1 - = K2 TGK2L2 TGK1L1 was obtained and its qualitative analysis was carried out. The numerical analysis of this equation in the Mathematica 3.0 program has shown that if the width of the middle part of the rod is greater than the width of the extreme parts, then the RKR> RE and the bend of the middle part are the smallest. If the width of the middle part is less than the width of the extreme parts, then the REC <RE and from the middle of the middle part are the largest. If the rod is homogeneous, then RKR = RE, while the bend of the middle part is a sinusoid. Literature 1. Volmir f. The stability of deformed systems. - M. : Science, 1967 .-- 984 p. 140
