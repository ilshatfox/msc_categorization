One definition of Kartanovsky continuations, let L = ⊕ -1i = −dli - whether algebra above the arbitrary field K, generated by the subspace of L -1 dimension R, l = l (x) - free algebrah above K, generated by the space x = 〈ξ1,. .., ctor〉 k, onic: l → l - homorphism that continues linear isomorphism x → l -1, and I - the core of this homomorphism. Let r = و = −urb ri = l⊕f - algebra cantor (universal kartanovskoe continuation [1], [2]), where ri = li for all I <0 and f = و = 0 fi with fi with fi = Ri = ti+1⊗x (Ti-I-I-tensor degree of space x ∗ = 〈x1, ..., x3〉, lection (xj) = δij, i, j = 1, ..., r) when I> 0; F = φ∑ i = 0 FI - the Zagalgebra in F elements that retain I. We denote through W - such a subspace in TD+1, that Wering ⊆ FD for any I = 1, ..., R, and determine ("creeping (" crawling Display ") πd = π: td+1 → VD+1, where VD+1 is such a space above K, that VD+1 = ∑ V (D1, ..., DR) (the amount is taken in all (D1,. .., DR) with di ∈ Z, di> 0, D1 + · · + DR = D + 1) and DIM V (D1, ..., DR) = DIMF (D1, ..., DR) —- DIM F (D1, ..., DR). At the same time, π: f (D1, ..., DR) → → V (D1, ..., DR) and Ker π = w. Similarly, πk for k = 1, ..., d -1.

Zuev (Tambov, zuyev@math-uu.tstu.ru) manned algorithm for calculating the attached matrix in the switching region The best method of calculating the attached matrix and determinant in the switching region is a recursive method [1], which has the complexity of matrix multiplication. This method involves the use of ring operations and operations to reduce the ring on the non -equal element of the ring. It is assumed that even angular miners of the matrix are different from zero. This imposes significant restrictions on the practical application of the recursive method. A real report is devoted to the removal of this restriction and generalization of the recursive method in case of an arbitrary matrix. The main ideas that underlie the generalized algorithm are as follows. 1. pilotism. The restrictions on the recursive algorithm are associated with the possibility of the appearance of zero diagonal miners of the second order at a certain stage of calculations, which leads to the stop of the algorithm. To remove this restriction, it is necessary to control the choice of this diagonal minor by multiplying by the matrix of the permutation. 2. Refusal of recursing. The recursive algorithm involves the sequential calculation of attached matrices for corner blocks about 2k (k = 1, 2,..). In a generalized algorithm, in connection with the need to search for a non-swarming minor throughout the matrix, it is necessary to abandon local-block recursing, since the emerging matrices of the permutations can connect the matrix far from each other. 3. Limiting the spread of permutations. If an attached matrix for an angular unit of the order of 2K can be calculated for 51
