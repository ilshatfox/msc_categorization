The correctness of the two -dimensional symbolic integral equation of the first kind 291 considers the two -dimensional Singoular integral equation (S.I.) B1.2x = i1.2 (PX) + VI, 2 (PX) = F (S, T), LSL <1, Itl <1, (1) where l 1 · () -_! _ jFF (A, T) X (A, T) D D I1, '2 Px - 2 () () () A T, 7R. a -s t -t -1-1 1 1 vl.2 (px) =: 2 j r (a, t) g (s, t, a, t) x (a, t) dadt, -1 -1 g ( s, t, a, t), f (s, t) - well -known continuous functions in their areas of definition, x (a, t) - the desired function, p (<j ", t) = = v'L ~ a2 / §, and the singular integral (p. And.) Is understood in the sense of the main value of the Koshi - the Lebug. A pair of spaces of the desired elements of X1, about and the right parts U1 are introduced, oh, on which the correctness of the source equation is established. Let x1, o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o - oh The space of continuous functions x (s, t), satisfying the condition of 1 1: 2 j r (a, t) x (a, t) dadt = o, -1 - 1 for which p.
