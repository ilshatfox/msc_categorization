)  АНАЛОГ ОДНОЙ ТЕОРЕМЫ ХАРДИ ДЛЯ ПРЕОБРАЗОВАНИЯ ФУРЬЕ–УОЛША  И ЕГО ПРИЛОЖЕНИЯ  Введение  Пусть H(T ) — пространство Харди, элементами которого являются 2π-периодические комплекснозначные функции, т.е. The boundary values ​​of the functions from the space H (D), D = {Z: | Z | <1}. The following Hardy theorem is known (see [1, p. 454]). Theorem a. n + 1 ≤ 1 2 ‖f‖h (t). Let nowh (r) - the space of Hardy with the norm ‖ · ‖ h (r), the elements of which are integrated functions. The following integral analogue of theorem A, proven by E. Hill and Ya.D. is known Tamarkin [2]. Theorem B. If F ∈ H (R), and F̂ - the transformation of Fourier functions f, then ∫ r+ | f̂ (x) | x dx ≤ 1 2 ‖f‖h (r). The next theorem is an analogue of theorem A for the rows of Fourier -Uolsh and the binary space of Hardy H ([0, 1)) (its definition, see [3, p. 104]). Theorem C. Let F ∈ H ([0, 1)), and f̂ (n) - the factors of the Fourier Fourier F according to the [0, 1) Walsha system {wm}+ger = 0. Then +φ∑ n = 1 | f̂ (n) | N ≤ 10 √ 2‖f‖h ([0.1)). In our report, the binary space of Hardy H (R+) is introduced and the analogue of theorem A is formulated for the transformation of Fourier -Uolsha (theorem 1). In addition, the applications of this theorem associated with the concept of binary integral in the spaces L (R+) and H (R+) are considered. The main results of the semi -interval of the species [k2 - n, (k+ 1) 2 - n) with n ∈ Z, k ∈ Z+ we will call a binary segment, and we denote the many of all such segments through D. For the function F ∈ L (R+), we determine the binary 76 The maximum function on R+: m (f) (x) = sup xorn, iorn ∣∣∣∣∣∣ 1 | i | ∫ i f (t) dt ∣∣∣∣∣∣, x ∈ R+. Determination 1. Hardy h (r+) binary space of all such functions f ∈ L (r+), for which ‖f‖h ≡ ‖ ‖ (f) ‖l (r+) <mm. Obviously, h (r+) ⊂ l (r+), and ‖f‖l (r+) ≤ ‖f‖h. The next theorem is an analogue of the theorem A for the reduction of Fourier -Uolsh, introduced by N. Fine in [4] (see also [5, chap. 6], or [6, chap. 9]). Theorem 1. If f ∈ H (r+), then ∫ r+ | f̃ (x) | x dx ≤ 50 √ 2‖f‖h, where F̃ is the transformation of Fourier - the oolsh of the function f. In the book [6, p. 435] The concept of a binary integral in the space L (R+) as follows was introduced. For n ∈ Z+, we put WN (x) = lim k →+nder ∫ 2k 2 - n 1 t ψx (t) dt, x ∈ R+, (1) where ψx (t) is the generalized Walsha functions introduced by N. Fane in [4] (see also [5, chap. 6], or [5, chap. 9]). As proved in [6, p. 434], the limit (1) exists both almost everywhere on R+and in the metric of space L (R+). Therefore, for any function f ∈ L (r+) and n ∈ Z+ binary bundle (F ∗ WN) (x) = ∫ r+ f (t) WN (x⊕ t) dt, (2) and f ∗ wn ∈ L ( R+). Here ⊕ denotes the operation of the category of MOD 2 in the representation of numbers from R+ in the binary number system. Determination 2. If for some function F ∈ L (R+) there is such a function g ∈ L (R+) that lim n →+nder ‖f ∗ wn - 77 g‖ l (r+) = 0, then the function g ≡ i ( F) is called a strong double integral of the function F or the binary integral of the function f in the space L (R+). A strong binary integral does not exist for all functions F ∈ L (R+). For its existence, it is necessary (but not enough) the condition ∫ r+ f (x) dx = 0. The following theorem is known (see [6, p. 435]). Theorem D. Let F, G ∈ L (R+). Then g = i (f) then and only when g̃ (0) = 0 and g̃ (x) = f̃ (x)/x for x> 0. Determination 3. If for some function f ∈ H (R+) exists Such a function g ∈ H (r+) that lim n →+nder ‖f ∗ wn - g‖ h (r+) = 0, then the G ≡ I (F) function is called binary in the function of the function f in the space H (R+). Theorem 2. If the function f ∈ H (R+) has a binary integral in the space H (R+), then ‖i (f̃) ‖ l (r+) ≤ 50 √ 2‖f‖ h (r+). We introduce a modified binary integral, which is set by a sequence of a bundle of the species (2), the cores of which are determined quite simply. Consider the sequence {w̄n}+و = 0 modified nuclei: w̄n (x) = {0, x ≥ 2n; K - 1, 2N -K -1 ≤ X <2N -k, k = 0, 1,. . . It is easy to check that w̄n ∈ L (r+) and ∫ r+w̄n (x) dx = 0, n ∈ Z+. Determination 4. If for some function F ∈ L (R+) there is such a function g ∈ L (R+) that lim n →+nder ‖f ∗ w̄n - g‖ l (r+) = 0, then the function g ī ī (f ) We call a modified binary integral function F in space L (R+). 78 Analogue of theorem D is the theorem 3. Let F, G ∈ L (R+). Then g = ī (f) then and only when g̃ (0) = 0 and g̃ (x) = f̃ (x) h (x), where h (x) = 2 - n for 2n ≤ x <2n+ 1, n ∈ Z. Determination 5. If for a certain function F ∈ H (R+) there is such a function g ∈ H (R+) that lim n →+‖ ‖ ∗ w̄n - g‖ h (r+) = 0, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then The function is G ≡ ī (f) we will call a modified binary integral of the function f in the space H (R+). The next theorem is an analogue of the theorem 2. Theorem 4. If the function f ∈ H (r+) has a modified binary integral in space h (r+), then ‖ī (f̃) ‖ l (r+) ≤ 100 √ 2‖f‖ h (r+ ). Proof of theorem 4 is based on the next lemma. Lemma. Functions am, n (x) = 2 −nψm 2 - n (x) x [0.2n) (x) (m ∈ N, n ∈ Z+) are the own functions of the operator ī modification
