Potentials for one degenerate elliptical equation of the second type of Helmholtz, let B; - The semi -space xs> about the three -dimensional Euclidean spaces of dots x = (x1, x2, xs), d - symmetrical relative to the plane x3 = about the final region in E3, limited by the surface G, d+ = ej n d, g+ = ej n G. In the field of P+, we consider the degenerating equation of the gelm of the second kind (1) where A> 1, l is the material permanent. It is easy to prove that the foundation is the mental solution of equation (1) with a feature at the point HO has a form 1 (L) 1/2 W (X, XO) = 4. 2 n ~~~ (lrhh0), i 1grhego where n ~~; - the function of the GA. Knel of the first kind, rhho = x3 x30 (1 -a) 2 (x1 - x10) 2 + (x2 - x20) 2 + - - -1 - a 1 -A using this fundamental solution We build integral operators of the species: 270 where a [and] = cos (n, 6): ~ + cos (n, 6): ~ + ~ ~ ~ a cos (n, 6) %~ - connormal to the border g + at the point ~ E g+. The integral operator V (X) is called the potential of the type of simple layer, and the integral operator W (x) - the potential of the type of double layer. Theorem. Let g - the daring of Lyapunov and density 11 (~) and µ (~) are continuous on g+. Then the following limiting relationships are fair: 11 (~ 0) - 11 (~ 0) -wi (~ o) = - 2 - + w (~ o), we (~ o) = 2 - + w (~ o); A [v (~ o)] i = µ (; o) + a [v (~ o)), a [v (~ o)) e = - µ (; o) + a [v (~ o)) . A. R. Khairov {Makhachkala, hairov@mail.dgu.ru) about one class of orthogonal systems of polynomials, let E = (a, b) u {} and non -negative on (a, b) function h (x) are such that There are moments h "= .1 '[x"], where .1' [!] = 1 g h (x) f (x) dx + -yf (o), 'u> O. Using bundles of square forms (p (p) = 1, 2,. ..) proves that there is an orthonomated relatively .1 'system of polynomials {n n (x; -o)} ~ = o such that where PN (x) and QN -1 (x) is orthogonal The interval (a, b) and weight functions h (x) and xh (x), respectively. 271
