. Characterization of traces on algebrah von Neumann inequality dinjs Chong Jung Kazan State University, dinhtrunghoa@yahoo.com at all below we will assume that p> 2. in [3] it is proved that if for the positive functionality φ on the ∗-adulture of matrices of the nth nth. the order for any non -negative matrix A, B and any α ∈ [0, 1] is the inequality φ ((αA + (1 - α) b) p) 6 αφ (AP) + (1 - α) φ (BP), (1) then φ = k tr, where k ∈ R+ and TR is a standard trace. This work is devoted to the transfer of this result by the tea of ​​the algebra von Neumann (AFN), that is, the algebra algebra of all limited 76 operators in the guilbert space closed in the weak opera of the radar topology (see, for example, [1, 5]). The technique developed in [2, 4] is used. For AFN, we will denote through M+ many positive operators from M. Determination 1. Weighing on AFN M is the display φ: m+ → [0,+ urb] with the properties φ (x+ y) = φ (x)+ φ (y), φ (λx) = λφ (x), x, y ∈ M+, λ> 0 (in this case 0 · (+∞) ≡ 0). For the weight φ on m through m+ φ we will denote the set {x ∈ M+ | φ (x) < +urb}, through Mart - its complex linear shell. The set of MPR ∩ M+φ projectors with the final weight will be designated through py. Determination 2. The weight on the algebra von Neuman M is called: - final, if φ (e) < +و, where E is a unit in m; - normal, if Supi φ (XI) = φ (Supi XI) for any moisture -growing limited network {XI} ⊂ m+; - semi -final, if the set of Mips ultramosbo is densely in M; - followed, if φ (x ∗ x) = φ (xx ∗) for any x ∈ M. Determination 3. Two projectors p, q m from m are called equivalent, if partial isometry U ∈ M, such that p = u ∗ u, q = uu ∗. Comment. Let p, q-non-zero orthogonal equivalent projectors from M. Then ∗ -algebra, generated in (p+q) m (p+q) with the corresponding partial isometry u, isomorphic ∗-algebra of matrix M2 (C). Lemma 1. Let φ - positive normal functionality on AFN M, such that φ (p1) = φ (p2) for any OP 77 of the 77 equivalent projectors P1, P2 from M. Then φ is followed. With the help of a remark, lemma 1 and the above the sulfate of [3], the following theorem 1. Let φ - the normal final weight on AFN M. If for any operators A1, A2 from M+ inequality (1), then φ is the trace. Lemma 2 ([4, Lemma 2]). Let φ is a normal semi -inferior weight on AFN M, and for any projector p ∈ P's, reduced weight in reduced AFN MP is followed. Then φ is the trace. Theorem 2. Let φ - the normal semi -visible weight on AFN M. If for any operators A1, A2 ∈ M+ is performed (1), then φ is trace. To prove the theorem 2, it is enough to apply theo Rem 1 and Lemm 2.

Lobachevsky, Dolgonosova@rambler.ru Let G - a certain group of homeomorphisms of the Topologic space X. The subset A ⊂ X is called Ginovarian if G · a = A.. It is called in the form of unification of the orbits of the Group G. The non-empty closed G-invariant subset of the topological space X is called the minimum number of the Group Group G if the MM does not have the non-empty of its own closed G-invariant subsets. The study of the existence and structure of the mini -rash sets of groups of homeomorphisms of direct and districtly is devoted to a series of works by L.A. Beklarian [1]. In this work, we examine the minimum set of arbitrary group of isometry of the local compact meter. Applying the results of Van Danzig and Van der Wardin, from the messengers of [2], we proved the following statement. Theorem. Let (m, ρ) - a coherent local compact metric space and G - an arbitrary group of art meters (M, ρ). Then the closure of g · x orbit g · x at any point x ∈M forms the minimum number of group G. 79
