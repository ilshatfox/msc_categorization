Degenerate resonance in systems with two degrees of freedom A.V. Potapov Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N. I. Lobachevsky will consider the system with two degrees of freedom ẍ + f0 (x) = ²f (x, ẋ, y, ẏ), ÿ + g0 (y) = ²g (x, ẋ, y, ẏ), (1) Which, after the transition to the variable "action-contribution", write in the form ̇ = ²f (i, j, θ, β), j̇ = ²r (i, j, θ, β), (2) θ̇ = ρ (i, j) + ²K (I, J, θ, β), β̇ = 1, 125 Where slow variables I and J change in a single single -legged limited area ∆ ⊂ R2; (θ, β) (mod 2π) - fast angular variables running two -dimensional TOR T 2; ρ (i, j) = ω (i)/ν (j)-the function of slow variables, ω (i) and ν (j)-frequencies of unrelated oscillators, functions f, r, k-2π-periodic in the corners. Determination 1. We will say that in the system (2) there is a resonance (p: q), if ρ (i, j) = q/p ∈ Q. We denote through ipq, jpq resonant values ​​I and J, respectively. Determination 2. We will say that in the system (2) there is a degenerate resonance of order K if at the point (IPQ, JPQ) all derivatives from the function ρ by variables I, j to order K inclusive 0, and at least one (k + 1) -I derived is different from zero. System behavior (2) near degenerated resonance, i.e. The two -dimensional torus of the unperturbed task, determined by the values ​​of I = IPQ, j = jpq, significantly depends on the procedure for degeneration and the properties of the functions F, R, K, characterizing indignation. Consider the case of degeneration of the 1st order (k = 1). In [2] it was shown that in this case, the system (2) is brought in the vicinity of the degenerate resonance (2) (with the accuracy of the order of the order O (²)) to the species ẋ = ²2/3f (∗), ẏ = ²2/3g (ffic ), ∗ = ²2/3 (x2 + ay2), (3) where f (gment), g (gment)-smooth (2π/p)-periodic functions according to ∗, and parameter A is equal to one of the three values ​​± 1, 0. With A = 1, we have an elliptical case, for A = −1 - a hyperbolic case, for A = 0 - a parabolic case. In the system (3) we can 126 but get rid of the multiplier ²2/3 using the transition to slow time τ = ²2/3T. In the work [4], the example of the system (3): ẋ = p1 sin onic+p2, ẏ = p3 sinovern+p4 cos onic, ∗ = x 2+ay2+p5x, (4) where the parameter P5 is associated with the introduction of the disorder, a decisive deviation from degenerate resonance, and P2 with the non -custody of indignation in the initial system. In [4], the system (4) was investigated, statements are given about the behavior of phase curves when changing parameters. However, the type of species (1) in which degenerate resonances would have existed until now. In this paper, this gap is replenished: it is proved that in the system ẍ + x + αx2 + x3 = ²Y, ÿ + y = ² (1 + x2) ẋ (5) for | α | ∈ (0, 2) can exist degenerate resonances. The work was supported by the RFFF, project 03–01–00478. The author expresses sincere gratitude to his supervisor A. D. Morozov for his help. L and T R A T R A 1. Morozov A. D.
