Some of the upper assessments in the problem of Hilbert-Mail in 1998 S. Smeyl (see [5]) proposed to consider the restriction of the second part of the 16th Hilbert problem on a special class of polynomial vector fields on the plane. Relations    ẋ = y - f (x), ẏ = −x. (1) are called the equations of Lenar. In 1999, Yu.S. Ilyashenko and A. Panov [2] found a clear upper assessment of the number of maximum cycles of Lenar equations, depending on the degree of (odd) unitary polynomial f and on the upper assessment of the modules of its coefficients. The result of [2] is based on the theorem of Ilyashenko - Yakovenko [3], which connects the number of zeros and the growth of the holomorphic function. A few years later, Yu.S. Ilyashenko suggested finding an analogue of the result from [2] for generalized Lenar equations:    ẋ = yh (x) - xf (x), ẏ = −x. (2) The main result of this message is a clear upper assessment for a special class of generalized Lenar equations, which we call "odd". There is a very simple geometric condition for highlighting odd equations: they do not have limit cycles in some vicinity of infinity (in other words, all limit cycles 85 are contained in some vicinity of the beginning of the coordinates). This criterion is a natural generalization of the difference between the conventional equations of Lenar by the odd and even degrees (see [4], [2] and [1]). The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (projects 07-01-00017 and 08-01-00342), programs of the President “Leading Scientific Schools of the Russian Federation” (project NSh-3038.2008.1) and the program “Universities of Russia” (project RNP.2.1.5055 ).
