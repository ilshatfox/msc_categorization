S. approaches to determining the psycho -emotional characteristics of the information image of the user of social networks // International Journal of Open Information Technologies - 2016. - T. 4 . - No. 8. - C. 61–65. Statistical Analysis of Social Network User Metrics A.A. Vyshinskaya, Z.A. Enikeeva, G.Z. Vahitov  In this work a number of statistical indicators are calculated in order to identify the relationship between the quantitative indicators of the user profiles in a social network and the academic success of students. Keywords: Academic Success, Psychometrics, Social Networks UDC 519.21 The ultimate deduction theorem for trigonometric sums with the indicative function of F.G. Gabbasov1, V.T. Dubrovin2, M.S. Fadeeva3 1 gabbasov@kgasu.ru; Kazan State Architectural and Construction University 2 vyacheslav.dubrovin@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 3 Manysha-98@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University is devoted to the further study of amounts with fractional shares of indicative function. The assessment of the speed of convergence in a multidimensional maximum theorem with large evasions for the sums of functions from independent random quantities has been improved. The consequence of this theorem is the maximum theorem for the distribution of a trigonometric module with a indicative function. Keywords: indicative function, trigonometric sum, the limiting theorem, the speed of convergence when studying a number of applied tasks, in particular, the tasks of filtering [1, 2, 3, 4], the tasks of solid body mechanics [5, 6, 7, 8], calculation of the calculation multi -layer structures [9, 10, 11, 12], the tasks of low -temperature plasma [13, 14, 15, 16], there is a need to use the ratios connecting various characteristics of the processes. These ratios are empirical, they were obtained as a result of statistical processing of the results of field experiments. The maximum theorems play an important role. In this work, we have proved the limit theorem for the distribution of the trigonometric amount module with a indicative function. It should be noted that in [17, 18, 19, 20] the speed of convergence in various limit theorems for poorly dependent random members was investigated. Trigonometric amounts of the N - - 1 j = 0 Exp (2πi t f (j)) type play a large role in the theory of numbers. The method of trigonometric amounts is a working apparatus, both in the individual and metric theory of the distribution of indicative function. This explains the interest in the study of the distribution of the trigonometric amount module with a indicative function. In this work, it is proved that F.G. Gabbasov, V.T. Dubrovin, M.S. Fadeeva 53 theorem 1 at 1 ≤ x ≤ o (n1/6/ln4/3 n) Evaluation Mes {t: 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, ∣∣∣∣∣n - 1/2 n --1∑ j = 0 Exp (2πi t2 j) ∣∣∣∣∣> x} = Exp (−x2) (1+O (x3n -1/2 ln1/2 n)), where Mes {·} is the measure of the Lebaga. The history of the issue is as follows. V.P. Mineev [21] showed that ∣∣∣∣∣mes {t: 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, ∣∣∣∣∣n - 1/2 n - 1 j = 0 exp (2πi t2 j) ∣∣∣∣∣ > x} — Exp (−x2) ∣∣∣∣∣ → 0 for n → urb. YES. Moskvin [22] received an assessment of the rate of convergence of the order n and 2/9, F.G. Gabbasov [23] - an assessment of the order N -2/9. In addition, D.A. Moskvin [24] received the following result. Let the materially digit periodical with a period of 1 function F (t) satisfies on the segment [0.1] conditionally lips | f (t) - f (t ′) | ≤ a | t - t ′ | α, where a> 0, α> 0, t, t, t ′ ∈ [0.1], and, in addition, 1∫ 0 f (t) d t = 0, σ2 = lim n → mit 1∫ 0 (n - 1/2 n - 1∑ k = 0 f (t2k)) 2 d t> 0. Then evenly relative to x ∈ [0, N1/6/(ω (n) ln7/6 (n ))] (here because of the n → ∞), the ratio is the ratio of mes {ă: 0 ≤ ă 1, σ–1n - 1 n --1∑ k = 0 f (ă2k) ∈ thrust} = φ (∆X) (1+O (x3N -1/2 ln3/2 (n (1+x3)))), where ∆x = [−x, x], and ∆x - the appearance of the segment ∆x. This is the so -called theorem about large evasions. The proof of the theorem is carried out by the methods of probability theory and is based on the fact that the function f (t) can be recorded in the form of F (ε1, ε2,.), Where ε1, ε2 ,. . . - Rademacher functions that can be considered independent random values. In case of proof, there is no need to limit himself to become a special class of functions from independent random quantities. In this work, a multidimensional analogue of this theorem with an assessment of the balance is better than in [25]. Theorem 2 Low ε1, ε2 ,. . . -the sequence of independent equally distributed random values, F is a measurable display of the number of numerical sequences into the K-Mortal Euclidean space. Suppose that random vectors ctor j = f (ε j, ε j+1,.) = (Ă j 1, ă j 2,., Ă j k) satisfy the conditions 1) eason j 1 = 0, | oring J 1 | ≤ c1, j = 1.2 ,. . . , k; 2) E 1/ν ∣∣∣ν J 1 —e {ă j 1∣∣∣ε1, ε2 ,. . . , εr} ∣∣∣ν ≤ c2νExp (−αR) for all ν ≥ 1, where E {ă j 1 ∣∣∣ε1 ,. . . , εr} - conditional mathematical expectation of hole j 1, provided that ε1, ε2 are fixed ,. . . , εr; 3) Matrix R with elements ρl j = lim n → φn −1e {n∑ s = 1} n∑ S = 1 ising J} is unpertured.
