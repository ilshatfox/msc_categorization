The growth of entire functions with specified zeros and the presentation of the measorphic functions BE λ = {λn}, n = 1, 2 ,. . . - the sequence of complex points on the plane C, λn → ger (for simplicity 0 /∈ λ); Λ (r) - the number of points of this sequence in the circle {| z | <r}; Nλ (r) = ∫ r 0 λ (t) d ln t. For a whole function F, we believe mf (r) = max {| f (z) | : | z | = R}, R ≥ 0. A whole function F is turned into zero at the λ sequence, if at each point λ ∈ C of the frequency of zero functions F no less than the number of repetitions of this point λ in the sequence λ (write f (λ) = 0). For the middle in C function F via TF (R), R ≥ 0, we denote the classic characteristic of this function. The main theorem [1]. Let the function ε (r)> 0 decreasing and convex on the beam (C, +urb) with some C ≥ 0. Then there is a whole function F such that f 6≡ 0, f (λ) = 0 and ln mf (r) = O (1 ε (r) nλ ((1 + ε (r)) · r)), r → + urb. (E) Let F - the middle function in C. Then there is a representation of f = g/h in the form of a particular whole functions g and h such that max {ln mg (r), ln mh (r)} = o (1 ε (r) TF ((1 + ε (r)) · r)), r → + urb. (M) Previously, such results were known only for special functions ε (r) ≡ const> 0 (see [2]) and ε (r) = ²/r, ² ≡ const> 0 (see [3], where And in this case, the assessments are worse than in (e) and (m)). For example, from [3] it follows only significantly weaker than in (m), the rating O (R3TF (R + ²)), while according to (M) the R3 factor can be replaced with R. The main theorem in a certain sense is irreversible both in terms of accuracy of assessments (E) and 224 (M) and according to the conditions for the function ε (r). The method of its evidence (“sweeping”) is new, unrequited and different from the methods from [2], [3]. L and T R A T R A 1. Khabibullin B. N.
