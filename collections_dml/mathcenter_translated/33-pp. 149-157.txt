The use of two-layer oblique discriminatory schemes to solve the non-stationary problem of convection-diservation V. N. Zubov Rostov State University, Rostov-on-Don 1 setting the problem in this work investigates the effectiveness and accuracy of two-layer oblique variety schemes on the example of the non-stationary task of convective-diservation transmission . Consider the dynamic task of convection-disjuction in two-dimensional cases, I take into account the inconsistency of the medium (DIV ~ v = 0), we will write it in a “symmetrical” form   ∂ ∂ç ∂t- 1 PE ∆ accord + 1 2∑ I = 1 (VI ∂XI ∂XI + ∂VIPIP) = F (X1, X2, T), WL = 0 = PO (X1, X2), ivil | ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ D = ∗γ, ω = [0, 1] × [0, 1]. (1.1) in the system (1.1) ~ v = (v1 (x1, x2), v2 (x1, x2)) - the vector of the speed of the medium. An infinitely differentiated function is considered as an accurate solution (x1, x2, t) = e t+x1+x2 sin (πx1) sin (πx2), therefore, the edge conditions of the first kind, initial conditions and function F (x1, x2, t) selected accordingly. As a result of the introduction of a uniform mesh through the space and approximation of the equation on the standard five-point template using the central differences for the approximation of the first derivative of space, we obtain a two-layer operator-growth scheme b yk +1-yk τ +ayk = fk, k ∈ N ∪ {0}, (1.2) 149 The use of two -layer oblique variety of different circuits. . . y0 = onic | t = 0. (1.3) Here A, B-linear operators in the material space H of mesh functions, YK is the solution of the system (1.1) on the K-m layer in time. Further through A, B we will also designate the matrices of the corresponding net operators with some selected basis in H. We decompose the matrix A in the amount of symmetrical (A0) and the oblique (A1) matrices A = A0+A1, A0 = 1 2 (A+A ∗) , A1 = 1 2 (a --a ∗), a1 = kl+ku, where KL is the lower triangular matrix, ku is the upper triangular matrix. As you know [2], the matrix is ​​dissipative (A0> 0). The 2nd numerical method of solving the problem we build a matrix B of the two-layer operator-growth scheme as easily reversible: b = (bs + τk) b −1 s (bs-τk ∗), (2.1) where BS = E + O (τ) is the operator C diagonal matrix, k = ku or k = kl. Such a pre-consequent was proposed in the work on alternately-triangular oblique iteration methods of solving systems of linear algebraic equations [4,5]. Theorem 2.1. The scheme (1.2), (1.3) with the operator B of the type (2.1) approaches the task with the first order of accuracy in time and the second - in space. Proof. Substitute (2.1) in (1.2): (bs +τk) b −1 s (bs - τk ∗) yk +1 - yk τ +ayk = fk, (bs +τa1 - τ2kb - 11s k ∗) yk +1 - 1 - 1 - 1 - yk τ +ayk = fk. 150 V.N. Zubov, we will decompose the function of the solution in a series of Taylor: yk + 1 = yk + τiment ∂ t = tk + o (τ2), substitute the decomposition into the last recording of a two -layer scheme (bs + τa1 - τ2kb −1s k ∗) (∂icle ∂t ∣∣∣∣ t = tk + o (τ)) + ayk = fk. We will use the fact that BS = E +O (τ). Then (e + o (τ) + τa1 - τ2kb - 11s k ∗) (∂icle ∂t ∣∣∣∣ t = tk + o (τ)) + ayk = fk, ∂ç ∂t ∣∣∣∣ t = tk + o (τ) + (o (τ) + τa1 - τ2kb - 11s k ∗) × × (∂icle ∂t ∣∣∣∣ t = tk + o (τ)) + ayk = fk. Denote ψk = ∂icle ∂t ∣∣∣ t = tk, then ∂ices ∂t ∣∣∣∣ t = tk + ayk + o (τ) + (τ) + τa1 - τ2kb - 11s k ∗) × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × × (ψk + o (τ)) = fk, ∂ware ∂t ∣∣∣∣ t = tk + ayk + [o (τ) + (o (τ) + τa1 - τ2kb - 11s k ∗) × × (ψk + O (τ))] = fk. Considering that any linear operator is limited in the final space, we get that the expression in square brackets has the order of smallness O (τ). It is known that the operator A approximates the non-stationary equation of convection-diplomacy of the problem (1.1) with the accuracy of O (H2) [1]. 151 The use of two -layer oblique variety of different circuits. . . Imagine the operator B in the form of b = b0+b1, b0 = 0.5 (b+b ∗) = b ∗ 0, b1 = 0.5 (b --b ∗) = - b ∗ 1, where b0 = bs - τ2kb --1s k ∗ , Bs = b ∗ s, b1 = τ (k −k ∗) = τa1. Theorem 2.2. Let the operator A are dissipative, and the operator B has the form (2.1). Then, if 0 <τ 6 2ω and the operator inequality is performed 0 <a0 <b0/ω, then the circuit (1.2), (1.3) is stable in HD, where d = b0 - ωa0. Proof. Consider the operator B in which we will make transformations according to the method [4, 5]: B = B0 + B1 = B0 + ωA1 = B0 - ωA0 + ωA. We denote D = b0 - ωa0. Then d = d ∗ and b = d + ωa. From the conditions of the theorem it follows that D = D ∗> 0. We rewrite the operator B in the form of b = d + στa, where σ = ω/τ. Hence σ> 0.5. According to the investigation of 1 from theorem 12 ([1], p. 121) If the symmetrical part A0 of the operator A is non -negative, the operator B can be written in the form of b = d+στa, where σ> 0.5, d = d ∗> 0, then the scheme ( 1.2), (1.3) is stable according to the initial data in HD. 3 Computational experiments Consider the following options for the operator B: 1. B = e, 2. B = e + τkl [3], 3. b = e + 2τkl [3], 4. b = (e + τkl) (e + τku ). Using the selected schemes, the first of which is obvious, the rest of the implicit, the tasks with four different vectors of the incomplete environment presented in the table were solved. 1. The tasks were solved on a temporary segment [0, 1], a grid of 64 × 64 in space. The results of computational experiments p
