Materials of the Andreev Reflection At the Contact of A P-Wave Superconductor is A Normal Metal T.S. Tinyukova, yu.p. Chuburin  In the paper, the Andreev reflection for the Bogolyubov – de Gennes Hamiltonian with the potential in the case of the one-dimensional p-wave superconducting structure is mathematically rigorously studied. It is proved, that in the junction normal-metal – superconductor in the topological phase, the perfect Andreev reflection takes place (i.e., the incident from the normal metal electron is reflected as a hole) without reference to an impurity. Keywords: Bogolyubov - De Gennes Hamiltonian, Spectrum, Scattering Problem, Transmission Probability, Andreev Reflections. UDC 517.518.85 On the necessary and sufficient conditions of convergence of generalizations of sync-attached functions of limited variation A.Yu. Trynin1 1 TAYU@rambler.ru; Saratov State University. N. G. Chernyshevsky studies the approximative properties of generalizations of classic syncs built using the values ​​of linear differential operators of the second order with the potentials of limited variation. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniform convergence of generalizations of the syncs for the functions of limited variation have been obtained. Separately, the conditions of uniform convergence within the interval (0, π) and on the segment [0, π] are separately considered. Keywords: uniform convergence, synink of approaching, limited variation, syncproximation. As a result of numerical experiments in the works [1] and [2], SINCPPROCIMATION Operators or truncated cardinal function functions were opened. For an important case of equivalent interpolation nodes, these operators gave significantly the best approaches than algebraic interpolarment polynomials. Subsequently, the reference theorem has been proved, which establishes the possibility of approaching functions from some classes of analytical functions with the cardinal functions of the Whittecter (see, for example, [3]. In this work, studies of the approximative properties of some generalizations of the synink of approaches proposed in [4], [[4], [ 5], [6]. Let ρλ ≥ 0 ρλ = o (λ) with λ →+ger, h (λ) ∈R, and with each non -negative λ function qλ (x) there is an arbitrary element from the ball vρλ [0, π ] Radius ρλ in the space of functions with a limited change that disappears in zero: v π0 [qλ] ≤ ρλ, qλ (0) = 0, ρλ = o (λ). (1) A.Yu.

(4) (here x-1, λ <0, xn (λ)+1, λ> π denote zeros for continuing to solve the problem of the Cossack (2) or (3), after the determination in any way of the qλ outline outside the segment [0, [0, π] while maintaining the limited variation). For brevity, we will denote n = n (λ). The tasks of Koshi (2) and (3) in the case when qλ ∈ L [0, π] has the only generalized solution. The oscillation theorem, or the contour integration method, subject to (1), provide an unlimited increase in the number of zeros (4) n (λ) →+∞ with λ →+∞. The work explores the approximative properties of operators of the Lagrange type, built by the solutions of the Koshi type problem (2) or (3) and put in accordance with any one specified on the segment [0, π] the function F interpoiling it in the nodes {xk, λ λ λ k = 0 continuous The function is this: sλ (f, x) = n∑ k = 0 y (x, λ) y ′ (xk, λ, λ) (x −xk, λ) f (xk, λ) = n∑ k = 0 SK, λ (x) f (xk, λ). (5) selecting the Qλ function accordingly (it should be borne in mind that the condition (1) is sufficient, but not necessary for the presence of zeros (4)), we get a single representation in the form of an operator (5) of various designs of Lagranzhev such as classic interpolation Milled (accurately to the weight multiplier), the cardinal functions of the Whittecter, the interpolation processes of the lagrange, built according to the special functions of mathematical physics. So, for example, see [7], with an accuracy to the transformation of Lyuville, the polynomials of Chebyshev and the polynomials of Jacobi, in the case of α = ± 12, β = ± 12, are decisions of differential equations of problems (2), (3), with a potential that satisfies condition (1). If you take Qλ ≡ 0, λn = N2, then operators (5) turn into truncated cardinal function functions. Unfortunately, when the continuous, not disappearing at the ends of the segment [0, π], the functions with the help of operators (5), the phenomenon of Gibbs arises. We determine the operator, which in accordance with any receiving final values ​​on the segment [0, π] of the function F, the continuous function according to the rule tλ (f, x) = n∑ k = 0 y (x, λ) y ′ (xk, λ) (x −xk, λ) {f (xk, λ) - f (π) - f (0) π xk, λ - f (0)} + f (π) - f (0) π x + f (0). 330 Materials of the School-Conference using this operator, unlike (5), you can evenly come in the entire segment [0, π] continuously (not necessarily
