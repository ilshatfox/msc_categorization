) The use of the browser algebra when listing columns in [1] proven that many minimum cuts m of the graph g (v, u), where V are many peaks, U - many arcs, can be considered as algebra. Theorem 1. The many minimum cuts m of the graph with the operations entered on it ∨, ∧, ⇒ ⇐ is twice brower algebra <m; ∨, ∧, ⇒, ⇐, 0, 1>. The minimum incision p ∈ M is called unprovable (∧-lean) if for ∀m1, m2 from the ratio p = m1 ∧m2 purs p = m1 or p = m2. Let p (p ⊆m) - the subset of the impaired cuts, a (p) - many anticocans of a partially ordered set p. Then m = ⋃ a∈A (p) (∧a root). The presented ratio served as the basis for the development of the decompositional algorithm for the transfer of three elemental minimum cuts of the M3 graph, which consists in finding only the uninhabited minimum incisions P in the column and the synthesis of the entire minimum cuts (namely, the set of M \ P) for the partially streamlined minimum incisions in the algebra of the minimum minimal cuts (without using the search in the column). Theorem 2. The difficulty of listing many minimum three -element cuts of the line of line O (max {| u |, | m3 |}), where U is many arches of the column, M3 are many three -element cuts of the column.

Yu. B. Ermolaev (Kazan, yuriy.ermlaev@ksu.ru) about one definition Kartanov’s continuation, let L = ⊕ -1i = - dli - is algebra above the arbitrary field K, generated by the subspace of L -1 dimensional R, l = l (x) - free algebrah above K, generated by the space x = 〈ξ1, ... , ctor〉 k, ∗: l → l - homorphism that continues linear isomorphism x → L -1, and I - the core of this homomorphism. Let r = و = −urb ri = l⊕f - algebra cantor (universal kartanovskoe continuation [1], [2]), where ri = li for all I <0 and f = و = 0 fi with fi with fi = Ri = ti+1⊗x (Ti-I-I-tensor degree of space x ∗ = 〈x1, ..., x3〉, lection (xj) = δij, i, j = 1, ..., r) when I> 0; F = φ∑ i = 0 FI - the Zagalgebra in F elements that retain I. We denote through W - such a subspace in TD+1, that Wering ⊆ FD for any I = 1, ..., R, and determine ("creeping (" crawling Display ") πd = π: td+1 → VD+1, where VD+1 is such a space above K, that VD+1 = ∑ V (D1, ..., DR) (the amount is taken in all (D1,. .., DR) with di ∈ Z, di> 0, D1 + · · + DR = D + 1) and DIM V (D1, ..., DR) = DIMF (D1, ..., DR) —- DIM F (D1, ..., DR). At the same time, π: f (D1, ..., DR) → → V (D1, ..., DR) and Ker π = w. Similarly, πk for k = 1, ..., d -1. Let p = {p1, p2, ...} - a sequence of display where PK (XI1 · · · · XIM+1 American) = XI1 · · XIK - 1 · π (XIK · · XIK+D) · XIK+D +1 · · · · XIM+1ising if M - D+1> K> 1, PK (XI1 · · · XIM+1 American) = XI1 · · XIK -1 · πm -k+1 (XIK · · · XIM+ 1ising), if m - d + 1 <k 6 m + 1, and PK (XI1 · · · XIMXIM + 1ason) = 0 if M + 1 <K. Theorem. Let r = ker p (i.e., many of all such f ∈ ​​F, that pk (f) = 0 for all k = 1, 2, ...); Then L ⊕ R is the full Kartanovsky continuation of the algebra L. 50
