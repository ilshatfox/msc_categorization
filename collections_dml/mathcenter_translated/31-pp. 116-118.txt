Lee N. A. Overkin, Kazan State University, nadya.opokina@ksu.ru, let G - group, DIM G = N, and G - her algebra Li. Consider the form of Killing b (v, w) = tr (ad (v) ° Ad (w)). This is a bilanary bilinear form on the algebra Lee B (V, W) = Gijv IWJ, Gij = C K ISC S JK. (1) where U, v is the left -indicative vector fields on G [2]. It is known [1], [2], as for the tangent stratification of the TG group Lee G is a group. Its algebra Lee G10 has an Eα (A) = (EI (A), EJ (A)), I = 1 ,. . . , n, j = n + 1 ,. . . , 2n: ei (a) = l j i (a) ∂j + r k ij (a) u j a∂k, ej (a) = l s j (a) ∂s, (2) where rkij (a) = ∂2gk (a, x) ∂xi∂aj ∣∣∣ x = e, lsj (a) = ∂xj g s (a, x) x = e, ∂k = ∂ ∂uk, and g (a, x) - group functions . Then the arbitrary left -indicative vector field is V (A) = Viei (A) + VJEJ (A). The form of Killing on TG has the form B (V, W) = 2GIJV IWJ. (3) 116 Therefore, it is always a degenerate rank R ≤ n. From here the following signs of the types of algebrus G10 follow: the theorem 1. Algebra Lee G10 is resolved then and only when algebra Li is resolved. The theorem 2. Algebra Lee G10 is nilpotent, and only when Algebra Li G is in nilpotent. Consider the tensor stratification T 20 G. It is also a serene. Its algebra Lee G20 has the following basis of the levoinarit vector fields EKM (A) = L IJ KM (A) ∂ij, EI (A) = L J I (A) ∂J + (R K (A) U SM A + R M Mm is (a) u ks a) ∂km, where lkmij (a) = l k i (a) l m j (a), r k ij (a) = ∂2gk (a, x) ∂xi∂aj ∣∣∣ x = E. The arbitrary left -indicative vector field is expressed through them by a linear combination with constant coefficients: V (A) = Viei (A) + VKMEKM (A). Then the form of Killing in the group Lee T 20 G has the form B (V, W) = ((2N + 1) Gij + 2C K IKC M JM) V IWJ. (5) She is always a degenerate rank R ≤ n. The following properties for algebra G20 follow from (5). Theorem 3. Let CKIK = 0. Then: 1) Algebra whether the G20 is resolved then and only when the algebra is per resolved; 2) Lee G20 algebra is nilpotent when and only when algebra Li G is nilpotent. Similar results are true for coating stratification T ∗ G and tensor stratification T 02 G of the group G. L and T R A T R A TARIMOTO A. Prolongations of G-STERUCTURES TO TANGENT BUNDLES // NAGOYA MATH. J. - 1968. - No 32. - P. 67–108. 2. Shapukov B. N. Tasks for groups of Lee and their applications. 2nd ed., Additional. - M., 2002. On the tasks of the diffraction of elastic waves on the periodic systems of defects in the layered environment of E. A. Osipov, Kazan State University, pnb@ksu.ru is usually called the boundaries of the boundaries of the media section under which the boundary conditions differ from the standard conditions of conjugation. The tasks of the diffraction of elastic waves on defects in a layer environment can be formulated as the tasks of conjugating solutions of the system of equations of the dynamic theory of elasticity with explosive coefficients in conditions of conjugation. In the study of the tasks of the diffraction of elastic waves on periodic defects in the layered environment, the method of a redundant boundary task of Koshi was used [1]. Due to the frequency of the structure of solving auxiliary boundary tasks in each layer of the environment, the quasi -pierid functions (waves of the flock) of the type F (x, y) = eiχx +ger n = −mber fn (y) e i2πnx/l, where l is the period, were considered. Therefore, the system of differential equations for stresses and movements can be reduced to the system of equations regarding their Fourier coefficients. 118
