The approximate solution of one class of weak -random integral equations by the method of oscilizing functions in the work, the theoretical justification [1] of the method of oscilizing the solutions to the weak -random integral equation of the type KX ≡ x (t) + σ (t) ∫ a ρ (s) µ (t - s | ) h (t, s) x (s) ds = y (t), a ≤ t ≤ b, (1) where σ (t) = t or σ (t) ≡ b, x (t) - the desired function, ρ (s), h (t, s), y (t), µ (τ) - well -known functions, and p (s) ≡ | ρ (s) | - Weight. The approximate solution of the equation (1) is searched in the form of xn (t) = n∑ k = 1 ck ψk (t), (2) 8 where ψk (t), k = 1, n, - fundamental zero degrees on the null grid ∆ N: a = t0 <t1 <. . . <tn = b, ‖∆n‖ ≡ max 1≤k≤n (tk - tk - 1) → 0, k → urb. Unknown coefficients {ck} n1 are determined from the system of linear algebraic equations n∑ k = 1 αkj ck = yj, j = 1, n, (3) where n = n with σ (t) ≡ b and n = j at σ (t ) = t, yj = ∫ tj tj - 1 y (t) dt, αkj = (tj --tj - 1)+ ∫ tj tj - 1 ∫ tk - 1 ρ (s) µ (| t --S) h h (t, s) dsdt. We denote through L1, P (A, B) and C (p) ≡ c (p; [a, b]) the space of functions, summarized and, accordingly, continuous in the interval (a, b) with weight P (t). Let ω (z; δ) 1; p and ω (z; Δ) φ; p the essence of the moduli of the continuity of the function z (t) in the spaces l1; p (a, b) and C (p), respectively. Theorem 1. Let the conditions be fulfilled: 1) µ ∈ L1 (0, B - A), Y ∈ L1; P (A, B); 2) the function h (t, s) is limited in variable s relatively relative to T and belongs to the space C (p) by variable T evenly relative to S; 3) a homogeneous equation corresponding to the equation (1) has only a trivial solution. Then for all N, starting with some, the system (3) has the only solution. Approximate solutions (2) converge to the exact solution of equation (1) in the metric of space l1; p (a, b) with a speed of ‖x - xn‖1; p = o {ω (y; ‖∆n‖) 1; p + ωt (h; ‖∆n‖) φ; p + ω (µ; ‖∆n ∆) 1}. (4) 9 note that in the conditions of theorem 1, a certain smoothness of the function h (t, s) is required by variable t. This drawback is deprived of theorem 2. Let the conditions are fulfilled: 1) y ∈ L1; p (a, b), and the function µ ∈ L1 (0, b - a) is such that ∫ b a | ρ (s) | | µ (| t - s |) | ds <mm, t ∈ [a, b]; 2) a limited function h (t, s) is continuous by a variable T evenly relative to S; 3) equation (1) has the only solution for any praise of the part from the space L1; p (a, b). Then the system (3) also has the only solution and the approximate solutions (2) converge to the exact solution of the equation (1) at a speed of ‖x - xn‖1; p = o {ω (y; ‖∆n ∆ strong ∆ower) 1; p + ωt (h; ‖∆n‖) φ + ω (µ; ‖∆n‖) 1; p}. (5) Note that estimates (4) and (5) are in a certain sense (see, e.g., in [1]) final. L and T R A T R A 1. Gabdulkhaev B. G.
