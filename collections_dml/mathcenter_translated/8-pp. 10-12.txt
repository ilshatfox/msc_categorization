The procedures for approaching the functional classes in the Lorentz space with the mixed norm, let X = (x1, ..., xm) ∈ Rm, pj, qj ∈ [1, +urb), j = 1, ..., m, and f (x1 , ..., XM)-measurable in the label in the cube IM = [0, 2π] m function, 2π-periodic for each variable. Through lp̄, q̄, we denote the space of the Lorentz with a mixed 10 norm ‖f‖, q̄ = [∫ 2π 0 tqm/pm - 11m [. . . . . . [∫ 2π 0 (F ∗ 1, ..., ∗ m (t1,., TM) q1 t q1/p1-1 1 dt1] q2/q1 ...] qm/qm -1 dtm] 1 /qm, where f ∗ 1, ..., ∗ m (t1,., TM) is an irresponsible rearrangement of the function | f (x1, ..., xm) | For each of the variables xj, j = 1 ,. . . , m. Put ρ (s̄) = {k̄ ∈ ZM: 2SJ -1 ≤ | kj | <2SJ, j = 1, ..., m}, qγ̄n = ⋃ 〈s̄, γ̄〉 <n ρ (s̄), where 〈s̄, γ̄〉 = ∑mj = 1 sjγj. Through T (qγ̄n) we denote the many trigonometric polynomas with harmonics from Qγ̄n; Through EN, γ̄ (f) p̄, q̄ = infusion (qγ̄n) ‖f - t‖p̄, q̄ - the best approximation of the function f ∈ Lp̄, q̄. Let the vector be given r̄ = (r1, ..., rm), rj> 0, j = 1, ..., m. Through h r̄θ, we denote the class of all functions f ∈ Lθ (IM) such that ∥∥∆l h̄ ∥∥ θ ≤ m∏ j = 1 | hj | rj, l> max j rj; 1 ≤ θ < +φ, where ∆l h̄ f (x̄) is a mixed difference in order l. Here Lθ (IM) is the space of the Lebag. The theorem has been proven. Let R1 = R2 = ... = Rν <rν+1 ≤ rν+2 ≤ ... ≤ rm; 1 ≤ θ <p1 = ... = pν for j = 1, ..., ν and θrj · p1/(p1 (rj - r1) + r1θ) <pj for j = ν + 1, ..., m. ; γ̄ = r̄/r1. Then there is a ratio of SUP Forn r̄ θ eγ̄n (f) p̄, q ³ 2 - n (r1−1/θ+1/p1) · nν -1/q. An assessment of the procedure for the class of Bronov BRQ step is also obtained. Evaluations for the approach of the classes of HRQ, b R Qθ according to the norm about the wanderings of LP were previously investigated by Y. S. Bugrov, V. N. Temlyakov, A. S. Romanyuk, N. S. Nikolskaya, E. Galeev. More information on this topic is contained in the review [1]. 11 L and T R A T R A 1. Tikhomirov V.M.

The internal conformal radius r (d, b) of the region D on the complex plane Z at point B ∈ D is equal to the radius of the circle, which is the image D during the conformal display ζ = F (z) with normalization f (b) = 0, f ′ (b) = 1 ([1], p.18). Exactly, r (d, b) = | f (t) |, t ∈ ∂d; Through the reverse function z = f -1 [r (d, b) eiβζ] = f [(ζ + a)/(1 + aζ)] in the circle E = {ζ: | ζ | <1} The performance R (D, B) = R (F (E), F (A)) = | F ′ (A) | (1– | A | 2), B = F (A), D = f (e). The report shows the results of local behavior along the upper conformal radius R (D, b) above the area D and surface R (F (E), F (ζ)) above the circle E. Given the estimates and interpretations of the coefficients in the decompositions of conform radii in small the environs of points a ∈ E and B ∈ D. For some classes of single -leafy areas D, conclusions are drawn about the structure of the entire surface of the conformal radius R (D, b) or surface with the equation ω = 1/R (D, b) = λ (D, B ) for the density of hyperbolic metric λ (D, b). Theorem 1 states the bulge down of the surface λ (f (e), f (ζ)) above the circle E, provided that Schwarzian | {f, ζ} | ≤ 2/(1 - | ζ | 2). Theorem 2 is guaranteed a local convex down the surface λ (f (e), f [(ζ+a)/(1+aζ)]) above the point A in the class of non -shary (| {f, ζ} | ≤ 2/(1- | ζ | 2) 2, ζ ∈ E). In the same class, non -haryri on the surface λ (f (e), z) above the area d = f (e) lines that walk monotonously up this surface (theorem 3) were found. 12
