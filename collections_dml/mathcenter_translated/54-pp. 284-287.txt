UDC 519.642 On uniform approximation of the solution of the integro-reduced equation with the logarithmic feature in the nucleus A.V. Ozhegova1, L.E. Khairullina2 1 alla.ozhegova@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky 2 lxayrullina@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, the Institute of Computing Mathematics and Information Technologies, the article examines the weak-random integro-radio-radial equation. The authors introduce a couple of weight spaces to prove the correctness of the task. Further, the iteration method and the Galerkin method are applied to this task and uniform error assessments are established. Keywords: Integro-differential equation with a logarithmic feature in the nucleus, close solution, correctness of the problem. The integro-radio equation of the type A (t) x (t)-1 π ˆ 1 −1 ln | τ-t | is considered x ′ (τ) p 1–τ2 dτ = y (t), −1 <t <1, (1) where a (t), y (t) - known continuous -differentiated functions, x (τ) - the desired function that satisfies the conditions X (−1) = x (1) = 0, (2) A.V. Ozhegova, L.E. Khairullina 285 A is a weak -raised integral as unacceptable. Traditionally, such equations belong to the class of incorrectly set for summer cottages in many well -known functional spaces. In this work, following [1], a pair of spaces of the desired elements and right parts is proposed, in which the correctness of the problem of solving the specified equation is established, which allows you to use any approximative method and obtain uniform convergence of close solutions to accurate. Denote iphous (onic; t) = 1 π ˆ 1 −1 onic (τ) t −for the symbolic integral with the cosa core, understood in the sense of the main value of the cat. Let the x be the linear space of the functions of the X (T) continuously differentiated on [−1,1], for which the symbolic integral ρ−1iρx ′ is also a continuous function, with the norm ∥x∥x = ∥x ′ ∥c + ∥∥∥∥ 1ρ iρx ′ ∥∥∥∥ c, where ∥x∥c = max - 1≤t≤1 | x (t) |, ρ (t) = 1p 1 - t 2. Let Y - the linear space of continuously differentiated functions y (t), for which the singular integral I (Q y ′) is also a continuous function, with the norm ∥y∥y = ∥y∥c +∥q y ′ ∥c +∥i (q y ′ ) ∥c, where Q (t) = 1 ρ (t). We write the equation (1) in the operator K X ≡ AX +GX = Y, X ∈ X, Y ∈ Y, where AX = A (T) X (T), GX ≡G (X; T) = - 1 π ˆ 1 −1 ln | τ - t | x ′ (τ) p 1–τ2 dτ. It was established that the operator G: X → Y is continuously turn and ∥g - 1∥y → X ≤ 1, and the operator A: X → Y is quite continuous. Lemma 1. If the operator a: x → y satisfies the inequality Q ≡ ∥a∥x → y <1, then the operator k ≡g + a: x → y is continuously turn and ∥k −1∥y → x ≤ 1 1–q . 286 Materials of the International School-Conference Lemma 2. In the conditions of Lemma 1, the only solution to the problem (1)-(2) can be found as the limit in the X iterative sequence {XK}, GXK + 1 + Axk = Y, K = 0.1,. .. where x0 ∈ X is an arbitrary initial approximation, and the following estimates ∥x ∗ ∗ ∗ ≤ qk ∥x 1 ∥0∥k, k = 1.2, ... if, in addition, the initial The approximation is selected according to the formula X0 = G -1Y, then the rating ∥x ∗ ∗ \ ≤ ≤ qk+1 --q ∥y∥y, k = 1.2, ... designate through h R+1ω = h r r r. +1ω [−1,1] A lot of functions that have a continuous derivative (R +1) -th order, the continuity module of which does not exceed a given continuity module ω (δ), r ≥ 0, Δ ∈ (0.2], and satisfying Additional condition lnnω (1 n) → 0, n → φ. The approximate solution of the problem (1)-(2) will be searched in the form of xn (t) = n∑ k = 0 αk tk (t), where tk (t) = Cosk Arccos T - Polynomas of Chebyshev I, and unknown αk coefficients will find from the conditions of orthogonality of the inevitability of the polynomas of the Chebyshev I. The arbitrariness of the initial data class h R+1aps establishes the uniform convergence of close solutions to the exact in space X and, as a result, uniform convergence at the speed of ∥xn ′ ′ ′ ′ ′c = o (lnn nr ω (1 n)), r ≥ 0.
