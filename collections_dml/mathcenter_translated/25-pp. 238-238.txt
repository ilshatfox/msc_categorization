Constructing the conditions of mutual uniqueness of the display specified in the N-dimensional stellar regions, the displacements are considered, the star relative to the zero of the region G in the space of RN, for which the condition 11Gradr (x) 11 :::: kr (x), k> o, x = (x1 1 •••, xn) e rn. The display R (x) is determined by equality R (x) = 11W11, where W is the boundary point of the area G, lying on a ray drawn from zero through point x. For this class of areas, some results are established similar to obtained in [1]. In particular, it is proved that to the border of such areas, one can touch the cone from the characteristics that depend on the number k. Using the continuation method, the possibilities for the construction of the conditions of mutual unambiguous display F: G T-T RN have been studied. For example, an estimate was obtained from below the number C in the condition of 11 d-1 j (x) d2 j (x, ·) 11 Dist (x, 8G) ::: C, x e g, ensuring the mutual unambigence of the display f in g. Here F = ( /1, ..., fn), dj (x) = (a ~ x ~ x)), d2 /(x) (x, (x, x, ·) = (T a2 l (x)), 1 ~ j, k ::; P, m = l oxjoxm 11 · 11 - operator norm. Literature 1. Aksentiev L.A., Shabalin P.L.
