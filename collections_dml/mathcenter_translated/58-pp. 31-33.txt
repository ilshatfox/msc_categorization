Lobachevsky 2 alsu_sam@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky Electronic manual contains a brief presentation of the stereometry course that is studied by students of grades 10-11 in geometry lessons and students of physical and pedagogical and pedagogical areas of the Testamal disciplines, such as projective geometry, mathematical modeling and elementary mathematics. The manual is equipped not only by theoretical material, but also by examples of solving problems using computer mathematics systems. Key words: geometry, stereometry, maple, scilab, Geogebra, Prezi electronic manual contains a brief presentation of the stereometry course in the form of presentations made using the Prezi service. The manual has demonstration graphic materials and software procedures [1], [2], performed using the SKM programs “Maple 2018”, “Scilab”, “Geogebra”, the CorelDraw graphic editor and software for creating three -dimensional computer graphics ” Blender ”, which allows you to clearly familiarize yourself with the material. Below is an example of creating a procedure in the Maple package:> pyramida: = proc (x: :( line (symbol)), y: :( list (list))) Local L, l1, t, t1, n, p: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: n: = nops (x): l: = plottools [polygon] ([seq (y [i], i = 1..n-1)], style = line, color = blue, thickness = 2): l1: = seq (Plottools [line] (y [i], y [n], color = blue, thickness = 2), i = 1..n-1): t: = plots [textplot3d] ([sp (s (yq (y.

Creating An Electronic Manual On the Topic "Polyhedrons" of the Course of Stereometry with Using Mathematics Systems L.A. Bikbaeva, A.R. Samigullina  The electronic manual contains a summary of the topics of the stereometry course, which is studied by students of grades 10–11 at geometry classes and students of physical and mathematical and pedagogical directions in such disciplines as projective geometry, mathematical modeling and elementary    Р.

Frolov3 1 ravil.bkm@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 mikhail.ryashkin@gmail.com; University Innopolis 3 andrey.frolov@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the work considers computable linear orders, the signature of which is enriched with the attitude of the neighborhood. A description of the 1-calculation of such orders was obtained. The line of order was also described for which 1-calculation entails 2 calculation. Keywords: linear orders, 1-calculation, the ratio of neighborhood, density ratio, the ratio of the maximum, internally computable relations with the algebraic structure with the final signature are called computable, if the main set and all relations and functions of the structure are computed. In particular, the linear order is calculated if its main set and the ratio of the order are calculated, and (of course) the enriched linear order is calculated, if the order itself is calculated, and all added predicates are calculated.
