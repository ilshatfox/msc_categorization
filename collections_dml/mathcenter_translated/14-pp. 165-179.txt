Some classes of representing systems and their transformations, I Yu.F. Korobeynik (Rostov-on-Don) §1. Introduction 1. Let h - the complete separated by the local convex space (half -wp) with the topology set by the set of the prenature p = {p}, and let x = (xk) ger icles = 1 - some sequence of its non -zero elements, such that the system (xk ) nk = 1 linearly independent in h1 for any n> 1. Form on it the space of numerical sequences a1 = a1 (x, h) = {c = (ck) k> 1, ck ∈ C: a row φ∑ k = 1 ckxkk converges in h}. If ∀p ∈ P, ∀c ∈ A Put QP (C) = SUP N> 1 p (n∑ k = 1 ckxk), lc = ger∑ k = 1 ckxk and introduce into a1 topology a set of prenatures qp = {qp} p matter, then A1 is half the UP (see, for example, [1], p. 194). Operator L: ∀c ∈ A1 7 → LC ∈ H will be a linear continuous operator from A1 to H; Further, it is called the performance operator. 171 Code X is called the representing system (PS) in H, if any element X from H can be represented in the form of a row X = ger∑ k = 1 ckxk. It is obvious (see, for example, [1], [2]) that X-PS in H. And only when L is epimorphism A1 on H. Apparently, for the first time, the concept of PS for the case when h is the space of Fre She, was introduced by A.A. Talalan [3], who called them the presentation systems. Each basis in H all more will be PS; The opposite is not always true. For example, if h = h (g) is the space of the functions of the functions in the G ⊂ C field with standard topology, then the system (eλkz) φk = 1 for any λk ∈ C will not be the basis in h (G) (see. , for example, [4]). At the same time, as shown by A.F. Leontyev [5] and later in another way Yu.F. The box [6], for any convex region G B C, there is a sequence (λk) φk = 1 complex numbers such that (eλkz) φk = 1 - PS in H (G). Thus, if X-PS in H, then the decomposition of a one element x ∈ H into a row in X is not necessarily the only one, in connection with which the questions arise: 1) is it possible to determine constructively the coefficients of any decomposition of the element X according to PS X for any element X from H; 2) Is it possible to select (also ∀x ∈ H) these coefficients so that they depend on X linearly and continuously. The questions posed lead to definitions: 1. PS X is called effective (EPS), if there is a method of constructive determination according to any element X from H of any decomposition into H row in the system X; 2. PS X is called the correct (PPS) if the corresponding operator of the presentation L has a linear continuous right reverse (LNPO); 3. PS X is called effectively correct (EPS) if the corresponding operator of submission L has an effectively determined LNPO. Note that if the operator l has LNPO T, then ∀x ∈ H x = φ∑ k = 1 (tx) kxk, and the row converges in H. since the topology in A1 majors the topology of the passing convergence, then ∀k> 1 ∗ x): = (tx) k ∈ H ′, and the coefficients of this decomposition depend on X linearly and continuously. Obviously, each EPS will be even EPS. 2. Recall the definition of another important class of representing systems. The sequence of the X non -equalous elements (xk) φk = 1 of H is called an absolutely representing system (APS) in half a half, if any element x ∈ H is represented as a row x = ger∑ k = 1 ckxk, (1) 172 absolutely converging in H. Put A2 = A2 (X, H) = {C = (CK) K> 1: Q0p (C): = ger∑ K = 1 | CK | P (XK) <∀P ERP ERP}. Then A2 is also half aVP ([1], p. 196-197) with a set of prenatures {qp} pion, and the operator l0: ∀c ∈ A2 → ger k = 1 ckxk ∈ H Lineen and continuous (from A2 In h). At the same time, X - APS in H, then and only when L0 is epimorphism A2 on H. Since the decomposition in a row (1) does not have the property of uniqueness in a general situation, the same questions arise as for PS and PS and PS Definitions of effective, correct and effectively correct APS (with the replacement of PS with APS and L0), subsequently designated by the symbols of the EAPS, PAPS and EPAPS, are given. 3. Effective and correct PS and APS are used to build private solutions of linear functional equations. Consider one such example [6]. Let Q - a linear continuous operator H with a sequence of its own elements: Qyk = τKyk, τK ∈ C, τK 6 = 0, K = 1, 2, ... Suppose that y = (yk) k> 1 - PS B H and what {1/τK} omet = 1 - multiplier A1 (Y, H): ∀D = (DK) ger ∈ A1 (DK τK) ipp = 1 ∈ A1. Let F ∈ H and F = ger k = 1 FKYK-some kind of decomposition f of ps y. Then, as it is easy to check, a row φ∑ k = 1 (fk/τk) yk converges in h, and if Y0 is its amount, then QY0 = F. Therefore, if y - PS in h h and (1/τk) φk = 1 - multiplier A1, then Q is epimorphism h, and the method of constructing a private solution in h for any right part F of h is indicated when Y is constructive when Y - EPS. When examining such linear equations, the question often arises whether Q -1R q has q LNPO. It is clear that if such an Q −1 R operator exists, then ∀f ∈ H The element Q -1R F is a private solution to the QY = F equation, depending on f and linearly and continuously. We indicate fairly simple conditions that ensure the existence of LNPO Q -1R. Suppose that {1/τk} icle = 1
