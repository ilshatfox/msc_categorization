Linear decisions of one class of dynamic systems on the Torah Yu. V. Tretyachenko Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, Tretyachenko_y_v@mail.ru The system considers the system of differential equations {ẋ = p1 (x) cos y +q1 (x) sin y +r1 (x) ≡ x (x, y), ẏ = p2 (x) cos y +q2 (x) sin y +r2 (x) ≡ y (x, y); (1) on a two -dimensional Torah in the assumption that pi (x), qi (x), ri (x) (i = 1, 2) - trigonometric polynomas of the voluntary stitch N (n ∈ N) above the field R, x (x , y) 6 = 0, y (x, y)/x (x, y) 6≡ const. 199 for the system (1), with the assumptions made, is decided for the cottage about the existence of trajectories set by linear equation y (x, y0) ≡ µx+ y0 (mod 2π) (µ> 0). (2) It was established that all the permissible values ​​µ B (2) are distant, so that the corresponding trajectory is closed on the Torah. The work examines the issue of the existence and the number of other closed trajectories. This part of the problem was completely solved for the case when x (x, y) ≡ const 6 = 0, (3) that is, for the case when the system of system (1) is the grave curves of the equations DY DX = P2 (X) Cos y +q2 (x) sin y +r2 (x). The main results can be formulated by a trace. Theorem 1. If the system (1) has the trajectories of the species (2), then µ ∈ A = {(m - 1 2), n ∣∣∣∣ m = 1,. . . , N, n = 0 ,. . . , 2n}. At the same time, if µ is the permissible integer, then the indicated trajectories on the Torah are no more than two, if µ is fractional, then such a trajectory is the only one. Theorem 2. In order for the system (1) to have two trajectories of the species (2) with µ ∈ {0, 1,. . . , N}, it is necessary and enough for y (x, y) - µx (x, y) ≡ p (x) (b+ cos (y - µx - y ∗ 0)), (4) 200 where P (x) - trigonometric with Polin of a special species; y ∗ 0, b - some constant. At the same time, if the condition (3) is fulfilled, then either both trajectories (2) are simple maximum cycles, and there are no other limiting cycles on the Torah, or all the trajectories are closed to the Torah. Theorem 3. The trajectory (2) corresponding to the fractional µ ∈ A exists in the case if the identity is performed (4). At the same time, such a trajectory is the only one, and if the condition (3) is fulfilled, then all the trajectories will be closed on the Torah. The coefficient criteria for the existing linear trajectory with each all over µ ∈ A. In the case when the condition (3) is fulfilled, the unprofitable and sufficient conditions for the possible implementation of one of the following topological structures: either the curve (2) - about the Perenniral cycle are substantiated. On the Torah, there is exactly one simple maximum cycle of a more complex analytical nature, or (2) - there are no complex maximum multiplicity cycle of two, and there are no other maximum cycles on the Torah, or all systems of the system (1) are closed on the Torah.
