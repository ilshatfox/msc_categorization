) Descartas composition in the weakly symmetrical space of Weil by a weakly symmetric Riman space is called (see [1]) space, the curvature tensor of which satisfies equality where Il-, and {zb are the tensor of curvature, aÂµ, b "i, sa, drz, drz, EB - some vectors, \ 1 - a symbol of the covariant derivative in riman coherence. Weil W n space with a metric tensor 9AF3 in call S.L. is symmetri'y if its curvature tensor R ~ AF3 satisfies the ratio where airl, b "I, sa" i, sa "i, sa" i, sa "i, , DRZ, E6 - some tensors. It is known [2] that the composition of the two varieties of XN and XM, N+M = N can be considered as the integrated N-structure with parallel fields of sites. It is determined by the affiner A ~ ~ = o ~, \ 1 "la ~ = O. Theorem. ES.I.I.Abo Symmetri'y space w n admits the composition, then it is Euclid. Literature 1. Ozen fiisun , Altay Sezgin.
