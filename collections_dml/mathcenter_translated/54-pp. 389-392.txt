Approximations of almost-periodic functions in a uniform metric of Yu.Kh. Khasanov1 1 yukhas60@mail.ru; The Russian -Tajik (Slavic) University studies the question of the approach of almost periodic functions with whole functions of the final degree with an arbitrary spectrum in a uniform metric. The necessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to uniformly periodic functions are also established by the class of entire functions. Key words: almost-periodic functions, rows of Fourier, a spectrum of function, whole functions of a final degree, trigonometric polynomes, the best uniform approximation. Determination 1 [1]. The function continuous on the entire material axis F (X) is called uniformly periodic if for each ε> 0 can indicate a positive number l = l (ε), which in each interval of length l is at least one number τ, for which inequality is performed | f (x +τ) - f (x) | <ε (− least <x <mm). The space of uniform almost -periodic functions, we denote it cut b, is the closure of many trigonometric polynomials t (x) = n∑ k = 1 ak Exp (Iλk x), where aK - Fourier coefficients, λk are Fourier (spectrum of function F ( x) ∈ B), with the norm || f (x) || b = sup -ip <x <mm | f (x) |. Consider the class of functions f (x) ∈B with an arbitrary spectrum {λk}, i.e. functions that have a number of Fourier species f (x) ∼ φ∑ k = −mm ak Exp (Iλk X), where AK = LIM T → → → ° T ˆ T –T F (X) Exp (—Iλk X) D X. It is known [2] that for the class of functions f (x) ∈ B the value of AK can differ from zero no more than on the counting set of spectrum values ​​λ. It is this circumstance that makes it possible to spread the concept of a number of Fourier to the area of ​​almost periodic functions. Through Gσ (σ> 0), we denote a class of limited over the entire axis of entire functions of the degree not higher than σ. Consider the following important issue. Let 390 materials of the International School-Conference given the function F (x) ∈ B. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the belonging of this function to the class of Gσ. To resolve this issue, we give a statement that was previously used by the author in the work [3]. Theorem 1. In order for the uniform almost - periodic function F (x) to be appropriate for the class of GX, it is necessary and enough for its indicators Fourier λ {λk} to satisfy inequality | λk | ≤σ. S.N. Bernstein [4] found that among the functions from the class Gσ, performing on the entire actual axis the best uniform approximation of the 2π -periodic function F (x) is found by a trigonometric of polynoma degree not higher than σ. The proof is based on the fact that if Gσ (F; X) ∈Gσ and SUP −mm <x <mm | f (x) - gσ (f; x) | = Aσ (f), (1) where aσ (f) is the best uniform approximation of the order σ 2π-periodic, period 2π, the functions through the functions from class G’s, then evenly in all X (− least <x <و) have places. Assessments: | f (x) - 1 2n +1 n∑ k = −n gσ (x +2kπ) | ≤ aσ (f), (2) lim n → → 1 2n +1 n∑ k = −n {gσ (x +2kπ +2π) - gσ (x +2kπ)} = 0. (3) note that the above The result of S.N. Bernstein can also be obtained if instead of (2) and (3) use the ratio | φn (x) −qσ, n, n (x) | ≤ aσ (f), where σ> 0; N, n - any natural numbers, φn (x) = 1 π π π −π f (x + t) fn (t) d t = 1 2πn ˆ 2πn −2πn f (x + t) fn (t) d t, qσ N, n (x) = 1 2πn ˆ 2πn −2πn f (x +t) fn (t) d t, fn (t) = sin2 (n +1) t2 2 (n +1) sin2 t2, and with any fixed n evenly in x ∈ (− least, و) lim n → و {qσ, n, n (x +2π) −qσ, n, n (x)} = 0. When conducting similar studies, in contrast to periodic servants tea, where the conditions are applied only to the smoothness of the functions, for f (x) ∈ B, additional conditions are required and the behavior of the Fourier indicators (see e.g., [5] or [6]): a) when Fourier indicators have an endless point in infinity , i.e. Yu.Kh. Khasanov 391 | λk | <| λk+1 |, lim k → φ | λk | = Inous; b) when Fourier indicators have a maximum point in zero, | λk | > | λk+1 |, lim k → mm | λk | = 0. For the first time analogue of the theorem S.N. Bernstein for functions f (x) ∈ B is found in the works of E.A. Bredikhina [7]-[8]. Using the method of proof S.N. Bernstein, she found that if the function f (x) ∈ B has a number Fourier f (x) ∼ ∑ k ak exp (Iλkβx), having Fourier indicators with the limiting point in infinity, then among the functions of GL (X) ∈ GLIT ( σ> 0), for which there is an equality (1), there is a trigonometric of polynon degree not higher than σ. Now, using the theorem 1, we formulate the main result of this note, which is also an analogue of S.N. Bernstein for uniform almost periodic functions with arbitrary Fourier indicators {λk} (k = 0, ± 1, ± 2,..). Theorem 2. Let F (x) ∈B and Aσ (F) = SUP −mm <x <mm | f (x) - gσ (f; x) | (σ> 0). Then for any ε> 0 there is the final trigonometric sum piot (x) = n∑ k = 1 bk Exp (Iλk x) (| λk | ≤σ), for which the assessment is evenly valuable | f (x) −pσ (x) | ≤ aσ (f)+ε. To complete the presentation along with the theorem 2, we give the following statement when the spectrum λ {λk} at any final segment has a final number of maximum points and, moreover, the multiple is given
