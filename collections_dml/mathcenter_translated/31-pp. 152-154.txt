By the regular solution of the equation (1) in the area ω we will call the solution u = u (x, y), such as u ∈ C (ω̄), ux, uxx ∈ C (ω), ū ∈ C2 (0, t), where Ω̄ - close ω. Let D ≡ D (Y) = B2 (Y) - 4YMC (Y); λ ≡ λ (y) = b (y)/(2YM); p ≡ p (y) = √ D 2YM; w (x, y) = p - exp (−λx) [λ se (px) + p ch (px)] ymp (p2 - λ2); F (x, y) = 1 ym p ∫ x 0 sh [p (x - perf)] exp [λ (ă - x)] f (ă, y) dival. Lemma. Let F ∈ C (ω̄), FY, FYY S (ω), B (Y), C (Y) ERRO C2 (0, T), A (Y), B (Y) ERRO [0, [0, T]. Then any regular in the area ω solution U equation (1) is represented in the form of u (x, y) = q (x, y) + w (x, y) Lyū + F (x, y), where ū (y) - Solution of the equation ū (y) - w̄ (y) Lyū = Q̄ (Y) + F̄ (Y), and the function Q (X, Y) - any solution to the equation LXU = 0. Problem. Find regular in the area ω solution u (x, y) equations (1), such that ū ∈ C1 [0, t] satisfies the edge conditions u (0, y) = onic (y), u (r, y) = ψ (y), 0 ≤ y ≤ t, (2) 1 r ∫ r 0 u (x, 0) dx = δ0, lim y → 0 1 r ∂y ∫ r 0 u (x, y) dx = Δ1, (3) where wor (y), ψ (y) - specified functions, Δ0, Δ1 - specified numbers. Theorem. Let the conditions of lemma and ∗ (y), ψ (y) ∈ ∈ C [0, t] ∩ c2 (0, t) are respected. At D> 0, C 6 = 0, the condition 2p [CH (RP) - CH (Rλ)] 6 = R (p2 - λ2) SH (RP), (4) 154 is additionally executed
