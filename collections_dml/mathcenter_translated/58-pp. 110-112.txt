"Lobachev Readings - 2019" UDC 517.5 On one approach to building an analogue of the formula Bina V.I. Kuzovatov1, S.I. Bashmakov2 1 kuzovatov@yandex.ru; Siberian Federal University 2 krauder@mail.ru; The Siberian Federal University has received an analogue of the integral representation of theBe, which is essential in the functional ratio for the classical dzeta-function of Riemann. Keywords: formula of bina, integral representation, a whole function of the classical formula of Bina expresses the meaning of the Logarithmic derivative of the gamma function of Euler γ (Z) (if the material part of Z is positive) through the following integrals: d d z lnγ (z) =-1 2z + ln z −2 و 0 T d T (Z2 + T 2) (E2πt −1). This integral representation is used when finding a functional ratio for the classic dzeta-function of Riman ζ (S). Consider for the material x: γ ′ (1+x) γ (1+x) - ln x = −2 و 0 t t 2+x2 (1 e2πt −1 - 1 2πt) d t. By substituting the found ratio in the integral representation for the dzetafunction of Riemann ζ (S) and changing the integration procedure, you can get a functional ratio for the classical dzeta-function of Riemann. Recall that the integral representation for the collecting of the Riemann ζ (s) in the strip 0 <r <1 has the form: ζ (s) = −Sinπs π ′ 0 (γ ′ (1+x) γ (1+x) - ln x) x - s. The aim of this work is to obtain an analogue of the integral representation of Bina. In the future, using the constructed analogue of the integral representation of Bin, the transition to obtaining a functional ratio for the dzeta-function of the roots of a certain class of entire functions will be made. Let F (Z) - a whole function of the final growth order Once, what is its multiplicity). The number of roots is nothing more than counting. IN AND. Kuzovatov, S.I. Bashmakov 111 dzeta-function ζ F () zn Roots equation (1) is determined as follows: ζ f (s) = ∑ znorn f (-zn) —s, where s ∈ C. We will assume that zn =- QN, QN> 0, where QN forms some of the lasting numbers. Consider the function (z = x + i y) f (f, 2πi z) = φ∑ n = 1 ezn2πi z = φ∑ n = 1 e -qn2πi z. (2) Using the replacement of e -2πi z = W, a row (2) is brought to the form φ∑ n = 1 w qn, that is, g (w) = φ∑ n = 1 fn w n, (3) where the FN coefficients are determined by the following way: fn = {1, n = qk; 0, N ̸ = qk, and therefore, lim n → ° n √∣∣ fn∣∣ = 1. Note that in a series (3) an infinite number of FN coefficients is excellent from zero. In the future, we limit ourselves to the consideration of classes of rational functions G (W), for which it is fair (3). As shows the Sege theorem, the steppe row (3), the coefficients of which FN can take only the final number of different values, or is a rational function, or lacking outside a single circle. In case of rationality of the amount of the series (3) g (w) = p (w) 1 - w, where p (w) is polynomial, and n is a certain natural number. Suppose that degp (w) = n, that is, p (w) = a1w + a2w2 +. . . +AN -1W N -1 +W N, (4) where the coefficients A J ∈ {0.1} due to the decomposition (3), j = 1 ,. . . - N -1. The coefficients A J depend on the distribution {QN}. Here is a clear expression of the function F (F, 2πi Z) through the function G (W). We will have F (f, 2πi z) = p (e -2πi z) 1 - f - 2πi zn. 112 “Lobachev readings - 2019” note that the functions f (f, 2πy) and 1+f (f, −2πy), which are included in the right side of the form of the LE (5), are determined as follows (t = e2πy): f (f (f (f. , 2πy) = —A1t n - 1 + a2t n - 2 +. . . +an - 11t +1 1 - t n, 1 +f (f, −2πy) = 1 +a1t +a2t 2 +. . .+AN -1T N -1 1 - T N. To reduce the recording, we denote W (x, y) = onic (x - i y) f (f, 2πy) +onic (x +i y) [1 +f (f, −2πy)]. The main result of the work is the following statement. Theorem.
