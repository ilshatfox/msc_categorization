) A study of the probability of successful placement of particles according to cells by the methods of complex analysis, let the number of series of particles, each series of sustainable particles, n - the number of cells in the equally cutting scheme for the placement of particles in cells. We assume that events related to various series of particles are independent. The Chim is the probability of an event: in each cell there was no more than P particles from one series. The case of distinguishable particles in each series. Then pn = (1 f (1 + ~ + ... + ~) n) n ~ 1. p. d ~ 27ri nmzm+l ~ 'C and fair 6 theorem 1. Let p = an.
