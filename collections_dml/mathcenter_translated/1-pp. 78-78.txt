The study of the bending of round and ring plates according to the theories of Reissner A and Kirchhof Agapova Yu. V. Nizhny Novgorod State University work is devoted to the calculation of records of two types: a continuous round step-up thickness and ring constant thickness. The plate is bended by the transverse load Q (R, b) = %'t cosnb (g, in polar coordinates) and efforts applied along the contour. When solving the problem by the analytical method, the round plate of a step-to-stand thickness is divided into two parts: concentric circle and ring; Each of them has a load that has its own distribution law. The calculation is based on the updated theory of Reissner, learning the influence of a shift on a bend. The calculation of the task is carried out by the analytical method. The solution of the main differential equations consists of a common amount containing arbitrary integration constants, and a private one, depending on the overhead load. An algorithm has been developed on the basis of which the Fortran language for IVM IVM compiled a program that allows: • Based on the boundary conditions, to compile a system of equations for setting arbitrary permanent integration; • solve this system; 78
