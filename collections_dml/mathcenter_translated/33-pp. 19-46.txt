. The approximation of non -trivial trajectories of the global attorrator1 A. Kornev Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, Moscow considers the task of the quality behavior of the trajectories of a given semi -dynamic system at large times. We are interested in what points of space h can see the observer after a rather long (formally, endless) period of time, the initial conditions are taken from a certain ball Ba ⊂ H. The answer to this question for end -ry spaces H is given theory of ω predecessive sets, its generalization in case Locally non -membranous space H is commonly called the theory of a global attorrator. The main facts of the general theory and the method of approximation of non -trivial trajectories of the global attorney with guaranteed accuracy are given. The 1st work was carried out with the financial support of the RFFIF, the project No. 05-0565045, and the NWO grant 047.016.008 19 approximation of non-trivial trajectories. . . 1 Global attorney mathematical definition of a global attorrator as an object that “correctly” characterizes the dynamics of the system in large times, depends significantly on the class of the processes under study. At the moment, there are several widely used definitions. The following tasks are considered to be investigated in terms of the minimum global b andttractor (usually called “Global Rener”) proposed in the work of O.A. Ladyzhenskaya [12] for two -dimensional equations of Navier - Stox. Let h - banakh space with the norm ‖ · ‖, t - non -trivial subgroup of the additive group of material numbers r, t+ = t ∩ [0,+ ger [ - half -group of non -negative elements from t and s: t+ × h → h - continuous in the second argument The display with a half -group property S (t1, s (t2, u)) = S (t1+t2, u), ∀t1, t2 ∈ T+, ∀u ∈ H. Troika {s, t+, h} is called [14 ] Polodynamic system (PDS). At the same time, H is the space of the system, the role of time is played by T+, and the evolution of the system is set by the operator S. If T = R, then we are talking about a semi -odynamic system with continuous time. In the work, discrete PDSs are considered almost everywhere. Time is set by the half -group t+ = {i = 0, 1,. . .}. The transition from the operator of the task s (t, u) with continuous time is formally carried out by the following replacement: si (u): = s (τi, u) with some, not necessarily small, τ> 0. In this case, the term semi -dynamic system means that The dynamics of SI (·) is determined at I> 0. Note that if for some subspace H ⊂ H there is also Si (u) for all U ∈ H and I <0, then on h the initial semi -dynamic system can be expanded to the dynamic system. We introduce the necessary concepts and formulate the following the known results of the general theory of the attractions [3, 12, 14–16.20] in terms of semi -dynamic systems with continuous or discrete time {s, t+, h}. Further, for the convenience of presentation, we assume that the record is UT = S T (U) is also allowed for the case of continuous time, i.e., for t ∈ R. 20 A. A., the Kornev is called the following sets for point U. u) = {ut = s t (u), t> 0}, γ+t (u) = {ut = s t (u), t> t}. Similarly, the positive half -sector and its part are determined for an arbitrary limited subservience b ∈ H: γ+(b) = ⋃ u], γ+t (b) = ⋃ u∈B γ+t (u). Point ū is called a ω-predicting point for point U (or, the same, for the semi-sectors γ+(u), γ+t (u)), if there is such an increasing sequence of values ​​TN: 0 6 T1 <t2 <. . . <tn <. . . , lim n → و TN = +inous, that ū = LIM N → ger STN (U). Many all kinds of ω-predicted points for U is called ω-predatory set and then ω (u) is indicated. Similarly, the ω-predictive set ω (b) for an arbitrary limited subset B. Note that the set of ω (b) consists of the limiting points of all kinds of converging sequences of the type Lim N → ∞ STN (U), where U ∈ B, TN ր ∞. There is [16] Lemma 1.1. The set of ω (u) of all ω-predatory points for U ∈ H is invariant and closed. Recall that the set of M ⊂ X is called invariant (more precisely, strictly invariant) in relation to the PDS, if ST (M) = M for arbitrary t> 0. Note that an arbitrary invariant set consists of complete trajectories. The opposite is true. At the same time, there is an invariant set of an invariant set. The next Lemma [16] gives an equivalent description of ω-predatory sets. Lemma 1.2. ω (u) = ⋂ t> 0 [γ+t (u)] h; ω (b) = ⋂ t> 0 [γ+t (b)] h. 21 approximation of non -trivial trajectories. . . Here, the symbol [·] H means the closure in the metric of space h. Note that since γ + t2 (b) ⊂ γ + t1 (b) for t2> t1, in the condition of lemma, the intersection for all t> 0 can be replaced by the intersection according to T> T with an arbitrary t> 0. For a wide class of mathematical modeling tasks, a qualitative description, properties, approximation of the ω-predatory set ω (BA) = ⋂ T> 0 [γ + t (BA)] H for some sufficiently large enough The ball of the initial conditions
