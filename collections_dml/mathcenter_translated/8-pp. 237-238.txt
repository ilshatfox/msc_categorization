Polynomial approximations in the weight anisotropic spaces of the holomorphic in the polycolous functions, let DN = {Z = (Z1, ..., Zn): | ZJ | <1, j = 1, n}-a single polycryg in the N-dimensional complex CN, H (DN)-many of all the holomorphic functions in DN, ∗ (r) = (∗1 (R1),., Wor (rn )), r = (r1, ..., rn), uction - monotonously growing positive functions on [0,+و), ap (ship) = {f ∈ H (dn): ‖f‖ap (ship) = = (∫ dn | f (z) | p eXP (– pul (1 1-| z |)) dm2n (z)) 1/p < +nder}, dm2n-2n-dimensional measure of the Lebey on DN, Exp (-- ∗ (1 1 - | z |)) = n∏ j = 1 exp (− ventral (1 1 - | zj |)), 237 z = (z1, ..., zn) ∈ Dn. Let further HP (DN), APα (D N), 0 <p ≤ +inous, respectively, Hardy classes and bergman's weight spaces in DN, (see [1], [2]). If F ∈ AP (∗) and IM are many polynomials from Z1, ..., Zn, then through E (F) the closure of the set {IM F} in the space AP (∗) is denoted. The task of characterizing those functions F for which E (F) = AP (ffic) is classic is closely related to many issues of comprehensive and functional analysis, but was studied only in one case (see, for example, [3], [4] ). Let ∗ = (∗1, ..., onic): lim r → +ger onic (r)/ ln r = +urb, j = 1, n. We put m (j) k = sup 0 <r <1 (rk exp (−mon (1– r) −1)), m (j) s = sup k≥1 ksm (j) k, tj (r) = SUP SH≤ RS M (J) S, J = 1, N, T ∗ (R) = Min 1≤j≤n TJ (R), T ∗ (R) = MAX 1≤j≤n TJ (R) . Let X coincide with one of the classes HP (DN), APα (D N), 0 <p < +inous. Theorem. Let F ∈ X, F (Z) 6 = 0, Z ∈ DN. Then, if +φ∫ 1 r - 3/2 lg t ∗ (r) DR = +inous, then E (F) = AP (lus). Back, if +φ∫ 1 r - 3/2 lg t ∗ (r) dr < +و, then you can build a function F ∈ HIU (DN) such that E (F) 6 = AP (∗) for all 0 <p < +inous. Comment. In the case when F ∈ HU (DN), a similar result is obtained by the author in [5].
