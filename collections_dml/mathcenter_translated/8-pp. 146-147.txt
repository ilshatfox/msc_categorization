Sparr interpolation method spaces of Sparra [1] is a multidimensional analogue of the well-known K-method Peter. Its function (·, ·,.,., ·) ~ Θ, q act on sets of (n+1) ’ā = (a0, a1,..., AN). The implementation of the Sparra method in specific classes of spaces is greatly difficult in the fact that well -known theorems about stability (analogues of theorem about reiteration for the Peter method) contain an additional requirement that ā ā θ, q, k = ā θ, θ, j. Relatively recently I. Askritova and N. Kruglyak [2] 146 managed to prove that this statement is fair for the families of banana structures and their retracts. Thanks to this, you can get interpolation theorems for the spaces of Besov and Lizorkin-tribel. Theorem 1. Let −urb <sj, s <mm, 1 <p <mm, 1 ≤ qj, q ≤ least, ~ θ ∈ H2+, j = 0, 1, 2; Moreover, if the two values ​​of SJ are equal to each other, then let the corresponding QJs are also equal to each other. We put S = 2∑ j = 0 θjsj, 1/p = 2∑ j = 0 θj/pj, and let Q (1 p, s) - the inner point of the triangle ∆mj (1pj, sj). Then (f sjpj, qj (rn)) ~ θ, q = b s p, q, (q) (rn). Theorem 2. Let the two unexplored triangles ∆mj (1/pj, sj), ∆nj (1/rj, uj) and vector ~ θ ∈ H2+are set. Let the weak conditions T: F (MJ), 1, (1) → F (NJ), urb, (urb), j = 0, 1, 2 are fulfilled for the linear operator T (MJ); 1/p = 2∑ j = 0 θj/pj, s = 2∑ j = 0 θjsj, 1/r = 2∑ j = 0 θj/rj, u = 2∑ j = 0 θjuj. Then the operator t: bs p, q, (q) → bu, q, (q). If, in addition, the condition R ≥ P is fulfilled, then the operator t: BSP → BUR. Here Hn+ is many vectors (λ1, λ2,., Λn), for which ∑ λi = 1, λ> 0.
