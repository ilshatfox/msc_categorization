) The theory of the Opead and the Universal Algebra in recent years have published three monographs dedicated to the theory of the Opead [1, 2, 3]. In the work of the author [4] a more general definition is given, thanks to which an abstract clones can be considered a special case of the concept of operates. This means that each variety of universal algebra is essentially (accurately up to rational equivalence) there is a variety of algebra over a certain opera. The situation can be described informally as follows: the theory of the algebra varieties over the operates and the theory of diversity, which are traditionally awarded with the help of symbols of operations and identity, correlate approximately the same as the total 20 theory of groups and the combinatorial theory of groups. The report is supposed to consider three circles of issues. Firstly, the direction associated with the continuation of work [4] (see, in particular, [5]). Secondly, the use of linear operating theory to the study of the varieties of Superlgebr. And finally, the foundations of the theory of equivalence of Morita for the varieties of linear algebra over the operas. The simplest case is considered in [6, 7]. The general case is obtained using a new operational analogue of the module endomorphism ring. The work was supported by ROCR RT (project No. 05-5.1284). L and T R A T R A 1. Smirnov V.A.
