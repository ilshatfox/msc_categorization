The diffraction of the electromagnetic wave on the system of metal ribbons in the sparse-layer environment Ahmed Maher Abdel Baset ICUTET, G. ICIT, Egypt, the Galerkin method, the integral equation with the logarithmic peculiarity in the nucleus was solved, to which a flat task of differential electromagnetic waves on the system of metal ribbons in the spire environment. 1 setting the problem Let the plane z = hj, j = 1, n, divide the space (x, y, z) in the area d0: z <h1, dj: hj <hj+1, j = 1, n - 1, and DN: Z> HN filled with dielectric with dielectric permeability εj, j = 0, n. Let at the boundaries of the media section parallel to the Y axis, perfectly conducting endlessly thin metal tapes, and in the plane y = 0 on the straight line z = hj, j = 1, n, the ribbons correspond to the segments [αjk, βjk], k = 1, mj. We will consider flat electromagnetic fields, the components of which do not depend on the coordinate Y. Denote mj = ∪mjk = 1 (αjk, βjk) and NJ - addition MJ to the entire numerical line. It is necessary to find a field that occurs during the diffraction of a plane structure falling from above on top with a potential function ũ (x, z). The potential function u (x, z) of the desired field should be in each layer by solving the Helmholtz equation ∂2u ∂x2 + ∂2u ∂z2 + k2ju (x, z) = 0, (x, z) ∈ DJ, (1) and satisfy and satisfy the conditions of conjugation U (X, Hn + 0) = ũ (X, Hn + 0), U (X, Hn - 0) = 0, X ∈Mn; u (x, hn + 0) - u (x, hn - 0) = –ũ (x, hn + 0), x ∈ NN; 143 diffraction of an electromagnetic wave. . . ∂u ∂z (x, hn + 0) - ∂u ∂z (x, hn - 0) = - ∂ũ ∂z (x, hn + 0), x ∈ NN; u (x, hj ± 0) = 0, x ∈j, j = 1, n - 1; (2) u (x, hj + 0) - u (x, hj - 0) = 0, x ∈ Nj, j = 1, n - 1; ∂u ∂z (x, hj + 0) - ∂u ∂z (x, hj - 0) = 0, x ∈ Nj, j = 1, N - 1. It is convenient to consider the solution of the problem (1), (2) as The amount of the functions uj (x, z) = u (x, z) in DJ and supplemented by zero to the entire plane. In order for the Fourier integral transformation method to be justified, we will look for uj (x, z) in the spaces of Sobolev of the distributions of slow growth at the infinity H Loc1 (DJ). After the claims are found, it will be possible to show that generalized solutions coincide with the classic ones. Consider the additional conditions that ensure the uniqueness of the solution of the mission problem. Let uj (₽, ζ) - the image of the Fourier of the distribution uj (x, z). We will look for a solution to the problem (1), (2) in areas D0 and DN in the class of solutions that are leaving for infinity, that is, we will require that in the representations of UJ (x, z) = 1 2π +ger −mm +φ∫ −mm Uj (ă, ζ) e –iunk e --iζz daw dζ (3) at j = 0 and with j = n were not contained elementary harmonics corresponding to the infinity of flat waves. In addition, we will assume that the sophisticated decision U (X, Z) does not contain the components corresponding to their own waves of the layered structure spreading along the X axis (if such waves exist). 2 The task of the jump we consider the auxiliary task of the jump for the Helmholtz equation in the layered environment [1]. In the regions of DJ, you need to find a solution to 144 Ahmed Maher Abdel Baset equation (1) in the class of solutions that are relevant to the infinity, satisfying the conditions U (x, hj + 0) - u (x, hj - 0) = aj (x), ∂u ∂u ∂u ∂u ∂u ∂ z (x, hj + 0) - ∂u ∂z (x, hj - 0) = bj (x) (4) for j = 1, n. We will assume that conditions (4) are met on the X axis everywhere, with the exception of the final number of points. We will look for the function uj (x, z) as solving auxiliary problems of the cat [2] for the regions of DJ with boundary conditions UN (x, Hn + 0) = u + n (x), ∂un ∂z (x, hn + 0) = v + n (x); uj (x, hj + 0) = u + j (x), ∂uj ∂z (x, hj + 0) = v + j (x), j = 1, n - 1, uj (x, hj + 1 - 0) = u --j+1 (x), ∂uj ∂z (x, hj+1 - 0) = v --j+1 (x); (5) u0 ​​(x, h1 - 0) = u -1 (x), ∂u0 ∂z (x, h1 - 0) = v -1 (x), where u ± j (x), v ± j ( x) - auxiliary boundary functions. It is noted that the tasks of the Cossack for the Helmholtz equation are redundant, since the boundary functions cannot be set arbitrarily. Let γ0j (cil) = {| perf | > kj: i √ nut2 - k2j; | ctor | <kj: - √ k2j - ξ2}. Denote ∆hj = hj+1 - hj. Theorem 7. Solving the problem of the jump for the Helmholtz equation in a sparse -layer environment exists and only when the images of the Fourier of auxiliary boundary functions v ± j (₽), u ± j (₽) satisfy the system of equations V +N (₽) - iγ0n ( cil) u+n (₽) = 0, 145 diffraction of the electromagnetic wave. . .

At the same time, √ 2π (k2n - ₽2 - ζ2) un (ă, ζ) = eihnζ [v +n (ă) - ζu +n (ă)], √ 2π (k2j - ξ2 - ζ2) uj (uty, ζ) = (7) = eihjζ [v+j (perf) - ζu+j (ă)] - - - eihj+1ζ [v –j+1 (ă) - ζu - j+1 (ă)], j = 1, N - 1, √ 2π (k20 - perforate - ζ2) u0 (ă, ζ) = ζ ζeh1ζ [v −1 (ă) - ζu -1 (cil)]. 3 Integral equation will look for a solution to the problem of diffraction in the form of u (x, z) = ud (x, z) + um (x, z), where the first term in
