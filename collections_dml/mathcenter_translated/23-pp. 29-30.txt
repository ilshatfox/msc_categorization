The presentation of the elements of the algebra von Neumann in the form of the final sums of the works of the projectors, let the Hilbert space above the field C. through b (h) denoting *-algebra of all linear limited operators in H. Operator X ∈ B (h) is called the projector if x = x2 = x2 = x2 = x2 = x2 = x2 = x2 = x2 = x ∗. The following tasks are solved in the work: (I) to present each element of the algebra von Neumann M, which does not have the direct Ablev of the term, in the form of the final sum of the final works of projectors from M; (II) indicate the smallest upper boundary for the number of complicates in the terms of such ideas. Earlier, other authors considered only performances in a weaker form: the coefficients from C (or R) in the terms were allowed, the task (II) was not studied. In [1], a brief overview of the existing works in this direction was given and a complete solution to problems (I) - (II) for the case M = b (h) was obtained: each linear limited operator X in the guilertial space H is presented in the form of the final amount X = ∑ XK, where each XK has a work of no more than two projects at DIM H = inous and no more than three projectors at 2 ≤ DIM H <inous. The next statement is unreasonable (in terms of the number of residents). Theorem. If algebra von Neumann M does not have a direct abelev component (respectively, actually infinite), then each operator X ∈ M is presented as a final amount X = ∑ XK, where each XK is a work of no more than three (respectively, two) projectors from M. From our result,: - a new evidence of the equivalence of the primary classification of the algebrus von Neumann in terms of projectors and in traces of traces; - description of the Yordan structure of the Hermite part of the algebra von Mana (“algebra of observed” quantum mechanics) in terms of projectors (i.e., “questions” of quantum mechanics). We also give several auxiliary statements, presenting 31 independent interest. Lemma 1. Each Hydropotent q toiletal C ∗ -algebra A is presented in the form of a product Q = PY, where p ∈ Apr, and the operator y ∈ A+ and turn. Lemma 2. Let the algebra von Neumanm not have direct component of the final type I. Then: a) each operator x ∈ MSA with σ (x) ⊂ [−2; 2] is presented in the form of the amount of 24 symmetries from M; B) Each operator z ∈ MSA C σ (Z) ⊂ [11; 13] is presented in the form of the amount of 24 projectors from M; C) Each reversible operator y ∈ M+ is presented as a linear combination of projectors from M with positive coefficients. Lemma 3. Let N - algebra von Neumann and 2 ≤ n ∈ N. Each operator x ∈Mn (n) is represented as a final sum of pair of thes of the Idempotents MN (n), and in each complicated one of the dubbaters (left or right) is possible Choose a projector. For algebra b (h) the approval of Lemm 1 and 2, were obtained in [4] and [3], corresponded. Note that in [2] the problem (I) is solved for the wide class C ∗-algebr.
