Vilenkina Berdnikov1 1 evrointelligent@gmail.com; The Saratov State Uniwyr test in the article discusses the use of graphs to build wakes on Vilenkin’s groups. The work is a logical continuation of work with the participation of the author to find an indiscriminate algorithm for building a scalable function that generates orthogonal multiple analysis in Vilenkin's groups. Keywords: Veuvlet, Vilenkin’s groups, multiple analysis, graphs, scaling function, algorithm. Let (gn,+̇) - a local compact group of Vilenkin, which are elements of which are endless in both sides of the sequence X = (., 0N - 1, xn, xn+1,..), X j = 0, p −1 , G.S. Berdnikov 69 where P is any simple number. The operation of addition +̇ is defined as a passing addition to the module P, i.e. x +̇y = (x j +̇y j) (x j +y j mod p). Let gn = {x ∈G: x = (., 0n -1, xn, xn+1,..), N ∈Z The main chain of subgroups, g⊥n - a set of annurators, a - compression operator. Let D - N (G⊥m) - a lot of functions constant on G ⊥ −Nζ with the carrier in g ⊥ m. We will look for such ffic with the transformation of Fourier ∗ ∈D - n (g⊥m), which give rise to orthogonal kma. A necessary and sufficient condition for the scalable function was found in the works [1], [2], however, to find the function, it is required to overcome all possible options. The algorithm presented in the works [3], [4] and in this work does not have this drawback. First, we build a N-watering tree T and write down its vertices as nmopponent vectors (αn, ..., α1). Determination 1. [3] Let N - a natural number, p is a simple one. By N-vod, we mean a tree oriented from sheet to root and satisfying the following conditions: 1) the root and all peaks up to the nth level have the value equal to zero. 2) Any way (αk → αk+1 →., → αk+N -1) length - 1 is present in a tree exactly once. Here αi = 0, p −1. We choose a N-watering tree T and we will build a scalable function on it. Scheme 1 (transition from compact to a detailed record form). On the tree t, we build a new tree t̃ as follows. 1) We replace the sequence of n zeros ending with the root of the tree, to one vertex with the value (0n, 0N - 1,., 01). All peaks (N +1) of the level of the tree T are now associated with this vertex in the T̃ tree. She is the root of the tree t̃. 2) without changing the connections, we re -find out the rest of the peaks. If in the tree t from the vertex αn the path from n elements in the direction of the root αn → αn-1 → · α → α1 began, then in the new tree t̃ this peak will have a value equal to the n-dimensional vector (αn, αn-1, ., α1). Due to the conditions of the N-ninetry of the tree T, the only vertex corresponds to the only vertex in the tree. Also, if we denote Hei G H Ht (T) = H, Hei G H HT (T̃) = H̃, then it is obviously h̃ = h −n +1. Such a tree will be called a n-veinal tree in a detailed form form. The end of the scheme 1 scheme 2 (construction of a graph and mask). Now we will combine part (or all) the tops of the tree of the type (αin, ..., αi1) with the peaks (αin -1, ..., αi0) and get the column γ. Denote λα - n, α - n+1, ..., α -1, α0 = | m0 (g –n r α - n α - n+1 −n+1. .R α - 1 −1 r α0 0) | 2. If the vertex (α - n, α - n+1,., Α -1) in γ is associated with the top (α - n+1, α - n+2., Α -1, α̃0) then we determine the values ​​of the mask m0 (χ) the scaling function with the following appeal 70 materials of the international school-conference zoma: ∑ α̃0 λα-n, α-n+1, ​​..., α-1, α̃0 = 1 and λα-n, α-α-α-α-α- N+1, ..., α -1, α0 = 0 for all α0 ∉ {α̃0}. The choice of specific values ​​is arbitrary, the main thing is that the conditions indicated above are fulfilled. Additionally, put m0 (G⊥ - N) = 1.
