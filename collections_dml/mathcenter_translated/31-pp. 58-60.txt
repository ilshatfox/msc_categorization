Mutual non-polar hyperplos in the projective-metric space of E. N. Egorova Chuvash State Pedagogical University, Cheboksary, Stolyarovav@chgpu.edu.ru is devoted to the study of mutual-semi-polar non-paulic hyperpolosa distributions of M-dimensional. linear elements immersed in the N-dimensional-metric space KN with the absolute Q2N-1. Invariant methods of differential-geometric studies are involved in the study, namely, the method of external differential forms of E. Cartan [6] and the continuation method and coverage of G. F. Laptev [1]. The following values ​​are accepted everywhere below: ī, k̄, l̄ = 0, n; I, k, l = 1, n; i, j, k, s = 1, m; ̄ = 0, m; v = m + 1, n - 1; α = m + 1, n. Consider the N-dimensional projective space PN; Derive formulas of the projective rapper R = {aī} and structural equations of the projective space have the form [6]: Daī = ω k̄ ī ak̄, dω k̄ ī = ωk̄ ī = ωl̄ ī ωk̄ l̄, ωl̄ l̄ = 0. According to A.P. . Nordena [2], the KN space with a projective metric or projective-metric space [1] is the projective space PN, in which a fixed hyperkvadrika Q2N-1 (Absolute) is set. In the case of a0 /∈ Q2N -1, the equation of the absolute space of the KN can be written in the form of [3] Aikx IXK + 1 C (gi0x i + cx0) 2 = 0, a [ik] = 0, g0i = gi0, 59 g00 = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = c = COST 6 = 0, AIK = GIK - GI0GK0 C, and the condition of its immobility is determined by the equations DAIK - AILPPI - Alkωli = - 1 C (AILGK0 + AKLGI0) ω L 0, DGI0 - GL0ωli - Cω0i = AILPONL0. In the KN space, we consider the regular non-upper hyperpolosa H, that is, the regular hyperpolosa distribution of M-dimensional linear elements, m <n-1 [1]. It is known [5] that relative to the first order of the first order, the submarine H is determined by the system of differential equations ωni = λ n ikω k 0, ω v i = λ v ikω k 0, ω n v = a n vαω α 0, ω i v = n i vkω k 0. By analogy with the hyperpolosa [4], under the dual normalization of the regular hyperpolos distribution h ⊂ KN, we will mean the normalization of its basic distribution in the sense of A.P. Norden, that is, at each point A0 ∈ H, the planes of NN - M and NM -1 are given such as such as that nn - m (a0) ∩ πm (a0) = a0, nn - m (a0) ∪ πm (a0) = kn, nm - 1 (a0) ⊂ πm (a0), a0 /∈ Nm -1 (A0) ; The planes of NN --M (A0) and NM -1 (A0) are called, respectively, by the normals of the first and second birth at point A0 ∈ H; At the same time, in each center A0, the normal of the first kind NN - M (A0) contains a characteristic πn - m - 1 (A0) of the current element πm (A0), equipping the distribution of hypercoptic elements.
