Materials of the International School-Conference of UDC 517.9 Nongular transformations on the ultraproduction of Algebr von Neumann S.G. Haliullin1 1 samig.haliulin@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University introduces the concept of an ergodic relatively normal state of action of the group on Abeli ​​Algebra von Neumann and its properties are studied. The ultraproduction of such transformations according to A. Ocneanu is also considered. Keywords: ultraproduction, algebra von Neumann, non -singular transformations. First, we introduce the necessary definitions and preliminary results. Determination 1. ([3]) Let M - algebra von Neumann, ∗ and ψ - two normal states on m. The states ∗ and ψ are called equivalent if onic (x ∗ x) = 0 ⇔ ψ (x ∗ x) = 0, x ∈M. Note that the determination of the equivalence of normal states on the algebra von Neumann is enough to set on the projectors (see, e.g., [2]). Let G - a sepaable local compact group, (ω, f, µ) - probabilistic space. Determination 2. ([7]) the action of the group on the space (ω, µ) is called the measurable display T: (s, ω) ∈G × ω → TS (ω) & such that 1. For each fixed S ∈G display ω → TS (ω) is non -Ingular biocation ω; 2. TS (tt (ω)) = tst (ω), s, t ∈G, ω &; 3. TE (ω) = ω, where E is the unit of the group. The space (ω, µ) is called the G-measured space and is indicated (G, ω, µ). Determination 3. It is said that the action T of the group G on the space (ω, µ) quasi -and -navigable (or non -Ingular), if for e ∈ F µ (e) = 0 ⇔ µ (ts (e)) = 0 for any S ∈ G; freely (in relation to µ), if for any compact subset K ⊆ G such that E ∉ k and any e ∈ F, µ (E)> 0, exists F ⊂ E, µ (F)> 0, and µ ( F ⋂ ts (f)) = 0 for all s ∈G. Action T is called ergodic (in relation to µ) if the condition µ (e∆ts (e)) = 0 for all S ∈G entails µ (e) = 0 or µ (ω \ e) = 0. with space (g Ω, µ) We will connect the action α G on the abelean algebra von Neumann a = lux (ω), specified as follows: αs (ω) = f (t −1s ω), s ∈G, f ∈A , ω &. Determination 4. We set on algebra = lux (ω) the normal state ∗. Let's say that the actionα is non -Ingular in relation to the state of the exam, if for f ∈A onic (f) = 0 ⇔ onic (αs (f)) = 0 for any S ∈ G; Freely, if for any compact subset S.G. Haliullin 387 k ⊆g is such that E ∉ k and any non -equal projector g ∈A exists a non -zero projector F ∈A, F ≤ G, and ∗ (F αS (F)) = 0 for all S ∈G. The action α of the group on algebra A will call ergodic in relation to the state ∗, if for the projector f condition αs (f) = f for all s ∈G} = 0 or gment (1– f) = 0. Theorem 1. (Dichotomy theorem) Let on algebra a = licle (ω) set two of the nickel states ∗ and ψ, while the action of the α Group G on algebra A is ergodic in relation to these two states. Then the states lus and ψ are either equivalent or singular. Let us continue to consider the ultraproduction of G-measureable spaces. Let's start with the ultracisions of banach spaces. Determination 5. ([5]) Consider the sequence (Hn, ∥ · ∥) n] banach spaces, and letuu is non -trivial ultrafilter in many n natural numbers. Ultraproduction (HN) U is the Facultor L icle (N, Hn)/Nu, where lip (n, hn) = {(Hn), hn ∈ Hn: Sup n ∥hn∥ <و = {(HN ) ∈ Lux (N, HN): Lim U ∥hn∥ = 0}. We denote the elements of space (HN) u through (HN) u. Then the ratio ∥ (Hn) u ∥ = limu ∥hn∥ determines the norm on (HN) U, and in this case ((HN) u, ∥ · ∥) becomes a banach space. Let further (XN) - the sequence of linear limited operators specified in the corresponding banach spaces HN with the property of SUPN ∥xn∥ <mm. We determine the ultraproduction operator on the (HN) U, believing (xn) u [(HN) u)] = (xn (hn)) u. With this definition, the operator (XN) U is linear and limited and ∥ (xn) u ∥ = limu ∥xn∥. It is well known ([5]) that the classes of banach algebra and C ∗-algebr are resistant to such ultra-performance. Indeed, the multiplier and involutionary structures of ultraproduction are set quite naturally: (xn) u · (yn) u = (xn · yn) u, ((xn) u) ∗ = ((xn) ∗) u. In order to obtain a substantive theory of ultraproduction of the algebr von man, the design of ultraproduction must be corrected a little more. Determination 6. ([1]) Let (mN)-a sequence of σ-endive algebra von Neumann, onic-the normal normal state of the NMN for all n ∈N. We put linger (n, mn) = {(xn), xn ∈Mn: supn ∥xn∥ <mm}, nu (mn, onic) = {(xn) ∈ Linger (n, mn): limu onic (x ∗ n xn +xn x ∗ n) 1 2 = 0}, mu (mn, gment) = {(xn) ∈ Linger (n, mn): (xn) nu (mn, eed) ⊂nu (mn, gment ), Nu (mn, gment) (xn) ⊂ nu (mn, eed)}. The ultra-production of the sequence of the algebr of the neumann with the exact normal states is the factor-space (mn, onic) u = mu (mn, onic)/nu (mn, onic). Naakonets, we determine the condition on (mn, uction) u: ∗u [(xn ) U] = limu onic (xn). It is known ([1]) that (Mn, lus) U is the algebra of the von Neumann with the exact normal state ng. 388 Materials of the International School-Conference will need us
