Materials of the International School-Conference of Parabol-Hyperbolic equations have studied the reverse tasks to find the functions u (x, t) and fi (x), when gi (t) ≡ 1. The assigned tasks for equation (1) at n = 0 were studied in [ 4, p. 228–238]. In this work, the corresponding theorems of the uniqueness and existence of solutions to tasks 1-3 for equation (1) at N> 0. Literature 1. Sabitov K. B., Sidorov S. N.

Soliev1 1 SU1951@mail.ru; The Moscow Road State Technical University for the Hypersingular Integral Hilbert built and studied quadrature formulas with multiple nodes. Keywords: Hypersingular integral Hilbert, interpolation with multiple nodes, quadrature formula. The approximate calculation of the Hypersingular integrals of Hilbert and Koshiadamar was considered in the works of I.V. Boykova, B.G. Gabdulkhaev, I.K. Lifanova, A.M. Linkov, their students and followers. Some review of work on this topic is contained in the work [1]. Yu.S. Soliev 335 for Hypersingular integral Hilbert (see, e.g., [2], [3]) AX = A (X; S) = 1 4π ˆ 2π 0 x (σ) cosec2 σ - s 2 dσ, (1) understood In the sense of the final part according to Adamaru, where X (S) is the integral density, the continuous 2π is a periodic function, quadrature formulas with nodes of various multiplicity are built and investigated. Let Hn X = Hn (X; S) - trigonometric with Polin of order n with equal zero coefficient with COSNS, interpoling function X (S) in the nodes SK = 2kπn, k = 1, n, such that Hn (SK) = x (x (SK) (SK) = x ( SK), h ′ n (sk) = x ′ (sk), k = 1, n. It is known [4] that Hn X = Hn (X, S) = 1 N2 N∑ K = 1 (X (SK)+X ′ (SK) SIN (S - SK)) (Sin NS 2 COSEC S - SK 2 ) 2. (2) Approaching the density of the integral (1) with polynoma (2), we get the quadrature formula AX = A (Hn X, S)+Rn X = 1 N2 N∑ K = 1 (A (S - SK) X (SK)+B (SK)+B (s - sk) x ′ (sk)+rn x, (3) where a (t) = 12 (n (1+cosnt) - sinntctg t2) cosec2 t2, b (t) = n cos 2n --12 t COSEC T2 - 1 2 Sinnt Cosec 2 T 2 —N Sinnt, and Rn X = Rn (X, S) is a residual member. The quadrature formula (3) is accurate for any trigonometric polynoma of the order not higher than N −1. In x ′ (SK) = 0 of (3), the quadrature formula for the integral (1) obtained by the approximation of the density of the Jackson interpolation formula follows. In the quadrature formula (3) as nodes you can take points SK = 2K --1N π, k = 1, n. Let x (t) ∈ H (r) α, 0 <α≤ 1, r ≥ 2. Then, for the residual member of the quadrature formula (3), the assessment ∥rn x∥c = o (lnn nr+α−2), r is fair. +α> 2. In the work [5], using multiple and lacunar trigonometric interpolation, various quadrature formulas for the singular integral with the Hilbert core are built. These results are easily transferred for integral (1). Consider, for example, the case (0.1.2)-interpolation by nodes SK = 2Kπ2N+1 (K = 0.2N) (see [6], [7]). Let TN x = tn (x, s)-(0.1.2)-internal-sex trigonometric with polyonometric with polynoma of the order of 3n + 1 by nodes SK = 2kπ2n + 1 (k = 0.2n), such that t (j) n (j) n (j) n (j) n (j) n (j) n ( SK) = x (j) (SK), j = 0.2. Approaching the density of the integral (1) by polynoma tn x = tn (x; s), we get the quadrature formula Ax = a (tn x; s) +rn x = 1 (2n +1) 3 2n∑ k = 0 (s - 0 (s - 0 (s - 0 (s - 0 (s - SK) x (SK)+B (S-SK) x ′ (SK)+C (S-SK) X ′ ′ (SK))+Rn X, (4) 336 Materials of the International School-Conference where A (T) = 2∑n ν = 1 (ν 2 - (2n +1) 2) νcosνt +∑3n +1 ν = n +1 (ν-2n −1) (4n +2–ν) νcosνt, b (t) = −2∑n ν = 1νcosνt+∑3n+1 ν = n+1νcosνt, c (t) = −4∑n ν = 1ν 2 sinνt+∑3n+1 ν = n+1 (2ν -6n −3) νsinνt , and rn x = rn (x, s) is a residual member. Note that it is easy to find trigonometric amounts included in the expressions for the coefficients of the quadrature formula (4), however
