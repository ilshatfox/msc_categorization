A number of functions, analytical in a limited closed area A.I. Rafikov1 1 azat@rafikov.me; Bashkir State University in the work considers a special case of the problem of decomposing functions that analytical in the closure of the limited convex region C, in a series according to a special system of exponential polynomials with a correctly distributed sequence of indicators. Key words: interpolation, exponential polynomials, convex region. Let it be given to the intensity of the comprehensive comprehensibles = {λk, νk} with the only maximum point ughter and the limited convex region d ⊂ c. We denote the symbol h (D) the space of the functions in the closure of the region D, with the topology of the uniform convergence on the compacts. Our task is to find a representation of functions from this space using the ranks of exponential polynomials with λn. The result of A.F. Leontyev about the decomposition in a series for the case when the canonical work L (λ), built by points of the sequence λ, has good estimates from below, in particular, when it is a function of quite regular growth [3, ch. IV, § 6, p. 4, theorem 4.6.8]: f (z) = lim k →+ger 1 2πi ∮ | µ | = ρk ωl (µ, α, f) e µz l (µ) dµ, where panel (µ, α, f) - interpreting the function of Leontiev, α ∈C - parameter, and 0 <ρ1 <ρ2 <ρ3 <. . . - an unlimited sequence of radii, for which the conditions are fulfilled: ρk+1/ρk - → 1 at k →+urb and with any ε> 0 there is a number K (ε), starting from the circles ∂b (0, ρk) a suitable assessment is performed Below on L (λ). This work shows that when using the techniques described in articles [1] and [2], this result can be improved. Firstly, it is to significantly reduce the spread of the λ points inside the groups, moving from the rings to “relatively small” groups. Secondly, select linear combinations of the elements of the system {zk eλn z}+φ, νn-1 n = 1, k = 0 so that the decompositions on them have a simpler look. Finally, write down the condition of the theorem in terms of geometric characteristics of the sequence. Before formulating the result, the introduction of the designations are introduced. The family of non -empty sets U = {um} +ger = 1 call the separation of the sequence λ, if all the multi -member consists of points λ, do not intersect and +φ⋃ m = 1 um = λ. In this case, it is natural to introduce another dinemination, which depends on. The points of the group are numb as follows: {λm, k} nm k = 1 (Nm-112 Materials of the Youth Conference, the number of λK points lying λk), the multiplicity λm, k denoted through νm, k. We will call the breakdown with relatively small if the lim m →+ger max1≤k, l≤nm ∣∣∣∣λm, k −λm, lord, k ∣∣∣∣ = 0. Finally, through WD (∗, ψ) we denote the length of the arc This area between the points of touching the supporting lines drawn in directions Arg t = ∗ and arg t = ψ; For wλ (∗, ψ) - the function of the angular density of the sequence λ. Both of these functions are determined for all 0 ≤ accord, except for no more than a counting (possibly empty) set of values. Theorem. Let the limited convex region D ⊂ C is given and properly distributed in order 1 sequence λ ⊂ C, for which wλ (∗, ψ) = 1 2πwd (∗, ψ). Then there is such a system {em, k} +∞, nm m = 1, k = 1 exponential multi -martyr, which any function f (z) ∈ H (D) is laid out in a number of species f (z) = +gerM = m = +ger m = 1 nm∑ k = 1 dm, k em, k (z) converging in h (d).
