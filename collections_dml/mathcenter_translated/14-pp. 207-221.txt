) Convex conformal display and right -wing to the operator of representing the exhibits in this work in the present work solve the task of the existence of a linear continuous right -wing operator to the operator of representing the exhibits of functions, analytical on some limited convex set Q in C. It is assumed that Q has a fundamental sequence of the surroundings, consisting of convex areas. In particular, Q can be a area or compact. Previously, a similar task for limited convex regions Q in C was solved in [1] - [3], and for limited convex sets Q, which have a fundamental sequence of compact subsets, in [4]. 1. The geometric characterization of convex sets with a counting basis from convex surroundings. Further, Q is a limited convex set in C with a non -stately insides containing 0. Let D (q) - the family of all open environs Q, and A (Q) - the space of all sprouts of functions, analytical on Q. Then A (Q) = ⋃ G ∈D (q) A (G), where A (G) is the freter space of all the functions in G. B (Q) in the standard way we introduce the inductive limit of inductive invent (Q) A (G). Following [5], we use the definition 1. Let D - convex set in C, D - Close D in C, γ is the intersection of the relative border D C D. The set of D is strictly convex into ∂Rγ, if the intersection of any supporting line to D C D is compact. Let ω: = ∂Q ∩Q - part of the border Q contained in Q, ω0: = ∂Q \ ω. Below are the sets of Q, such that in D (Q) there is an account consisting of convex areas. The characterization of the sets of Q with this property is established in conjunction with I.V. Pilipenko. We believe b (µ, r): = {z ∈ C | | z - µ | <r}, µ ∈ C, R> 0. Theorem 1. The following statements are equivalent: (i) d (q) has an accounting basis consisting of convex areas; (II) ω is closed and the set Q0: = int -∪ ω0 is strictly convex in ∂Rω0. Proof. (i) ⇒ (II). Since the family of all open steeps D (Q) has a counting basis, due to [6] (6] (6] (theorem 1), a lot of ω 213 is closed. Suppose Q0 is not strictly convex in ∂Rω0. Then there is an interval [z1, z2) contained in ω0, such that its end z2 does not belong ω0, which means that it lies in ω. Let l-the supporting line to Q, containing [z1, z2), p is an open half-plate with the border l, not containing Q. Take any closed half-year, the transverse (limited) side M which lies on the interval (Z1, Z2), And the boundary perpendicular to m rays lie in p ∪ l. The addition of this strip is the open surroundings of Q, but, obviously, does not contain a single convex surroundings Q. The contradiction has been obtained. So, Q0 is strictly convex in ∂rω0. (II) ⇒ (I). Put QN: = conv (ωn ∪ int q), n ∈ N, where conv d is the convex membrane of the set D, ωn: = ω + b (0, 1/n), n ∈ N. show that (qn) n ∈N - the counting basis in D (q). It is clear that qn, n ∈ N, - the surroundings of Q. Suppose that (QN) n∈N is not a basis in D (Q). Then there is an open surroundings G of set Q, such that for any n ∈ N, there is Wn ∈ Qn \ G. For some tn ∈ [0, 1], xn ∈ ωn, yn ∈ Intt q there are representations Wn = tnxn + (1 - tn) yn, n ∈ N. Due to the limitations of sequences TN, xn, yn, n ∈ N, We can assume that they converge: TN → T ∈ [0, 1], XN → X, Yn → Y, N → ∞. Then Wn → W. Since the set ω is compact, x ∈ ω. Since Wn /∈ G, N ∈ N, compact ω is contained in G, there is ε> 0, for which DIST (WN, ω)> ε, N ∈ N. Therefore DIST (W, ω)> ε. Thus, W /∈ ω and T <1. Since Wn /∈ G, N ∈ N, then W /ERNT Q. In addition, y ∈ ∂Q. Indeed, y ∈ Q. If y ∈ int q, then for sufficiently large n (after all, 0 6 t <1) is also Wn ∈ Int Q, which cannot be due to Wn /∈ G for all n ∈ N. Since Y. Since Y. Since Y. Since ∈ ∂Q, X ∈ ω, W ∈ [Y, X] and W /SER int. Therefore, if W 6 = Y, a contradiction has been obtained with a strict bulge of Q0 in ∂Rω0. If W = Y, then Wn ∈ Int Q for quite large n, although this is not so. This means (qn) norn - the counting basis of the surroundings q. 2. The spaces of sequences. Operator of the presentation. Everywhere further it is assumed that there is a counting basis (qn) n] the surroundings Q, consisting of convex limited areas, moreover, QN+1 ⊂ QN, N ∈ N. For a convex set D through HD, we denote the support function D: HD (Z): = SUP t Photo Re (ZT), T ∈ C. Let Hn: = HQN, N ∈ N, EON (Z): = EXP (λz), λ, z ∈ C. We fix the sequence (λj) jorn in C, such as | λj | → ∞, j → urb. Through λ1 (q), we denote the vector space of all numerical sequences C = (CJ) Jorn, for which a series ∑ jorn cjeλj absolutely converges into A (Q). 214 For n, m ∈ N, we introduce banakh space of the numerical sequences λn, m (q) = {c = (cj) jorn ⊂ c | pn, m (c): = ∑ jorn | cj | Exp (Hn (λj) - | λj |/m) <imes}. Lemma 1. Let lim j → ger log j/| λj | = 0. Then λ1 (q) = ⋃ norn ⋂ morn λn, m (q). Proof. According to [7] (chap. III, Lemma 2, p. 108) for any n ∈ N, we have λ1 (qn) = ⋂ morn λn, m (q). If a series ∑ jorn cjeλj absolutely converges in some about the wanderings a (qn), then it is abs
