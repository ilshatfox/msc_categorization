RU when solving non-stationary problems of an electrochemical form of divorce are of special interests that maintain a geometric likeness (called car modeling). Regional mustache A ~ Podigious Authority A Similar to the regional condition for the task of the external flow of the ideal fluid of the arc of the circle of the radius R: 2µ DB 2K 1 de, d8 e - = " - and - = - = v0e d! F ay0 2 r d14> 1 '118 where µ where µ is +IO - the desired function; K- electrochemical constant, and the rate of change in a large -scale coefficient, b0 is a characteristic size, 1 // - current function, t = ln v/v0; IP1 = RE W1, W1 - Complex E D Fig. Rice . 2 current potential; S is an arc abscissa; V0 - characteristic speed; V and O - module and angle of inclination of the speed vector at each flow point. Therefore, the solution of the electrochemical problem (Fig. 1) is equivalent to finding solutions to the problem of hydrodynamic (Fig. 2). The decision of the latter ~ is found to conformal display of the current area, which is a circular triangle, on the upper floor a plane. This display is carried out by a function reverse to the ratio of solutions of hypergeometric differential equation. 119
