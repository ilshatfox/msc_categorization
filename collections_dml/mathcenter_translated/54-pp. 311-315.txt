UDC 517.95 The task of a conductor for a loaded equation with the operator Lavrentiev - Bitsadze Yu.K. Sabitova1 1 sabitovauuk@rambler.ru; Sterlitamak branch of the Bashkir State University in the article built a solution to the first boundary problem for a loaded mixed type equation in a rectangular field and its unity was proved. The decision was obtained in the form of a number of a series according to the system of own functions of the corresponding one -dimensional spectral task. Keywords: a loaded equation, the task of a conductor, a criterion of uniqueness. 312 Materials of the International School-Conference Consider the loaded equation of the mixed type LU = {uxx +ut t −b1 (t) u (x, d1) = 0, t> 0, uxx −ut t −b2 (x, d2 ) = 0, t <0, (1) in d = {(x, t): 0 <x <1, - −α <t <β}, α, β, d1, d2 - given positive values, b1 (t) and b2 (t) - specified continuous functions, b1 (0 + 0) = b1 (0), b2 (0–0) = b2 (0), b1 (0) and b2 (0) are not connected by any conditions . The task of the conductor. Find the function U (x, t) in the area D that satisfies the following conditions: u (x, t) ∈C 1 (D) ∩c 2 (d+∪d -); (2) lu (x, t) ≡ 0, (x, t) ∈ D+∪d -; (3) u (0, t) = u (1, t) = 0, −α≤ t ≤β; (4) u (x, β) = onic (x), u (x, −α) = ψ (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, (5) where pan (x), ψ (x) - set quite smooth Functions, ∗ (0) = onic (1) = ψ (0) = ψ (1) = 0, D+ = D ∩ {T> 0}, D - = D ∩ {T <0}. Based on work [1] - [3], we will build a solution to the problem (2) - (5) and prove its unity. Let U (x, t) - solution to the problem (2) - (5). Consider the function uk (t) = p 2 1 1 0 u (x, t) sinordes xd x, (6) where λk = πk, k ∈N. Based on (6), we introduce the function uk, ε (t) = p 2 1–εˆ εˆ ε u (x, t) sinordes xd x, (7) where ε is a fairly small number. Differentting equality (7) by T twice with t ∈ (−α, 0) ∪ (0, β) and taking into account the equation (1), we get u char, ε (t) = - p 2 l - ε Uxxx Sinords XD X - P 2B1 (T) L --εˆ ε U (X, D1) Sinords XD X, T> 0; (8) u charul, ε (t) = p 2 l - ε uxx sinordes xd x + p 2b2 (t) l --εˆ ε u (x, −d2) sinordes xd x, t <0. (9 ) Integrating in the right parts of the equalities (8) and (9) in parts twice in the integrals containing UXX, and moving to the limit at ε → 0, taking into account homogeneous boundary conditions (4), we get u′K (t) –λ2k uk (t) = −b1 (t) uk (d1), t> 0, (10) u′k (t)+λ2k uk (t) = −b2 (t) uk (−d2), t <0 . (11) Yu.K. Sabitova 313 Differential equations (10) and (11) are loaded and they have general solutions UK (t) =   ck e λk t +dk e --λk t - uk (d1) λk b1k (t) , t> 0, ak cosord t +bk sinord t - uk (−d2) λk b2k (t), t <0, (12) where ak, bk, ck, dk are arbitrary permanent, uk (0 +0), UK (0–0), UK (D1) and UK (−D2) - still unknown permanent, B1K (t) = tˆ 0 b1 (s) SH [λk (t - s)] d s, b2k (t) = 0ˆ t b2 (s) sin [λk (s - t)] d s. Now, based on the formula (12), we calculate: UK (0 +0) = CK +DK, UK (0–0) = AK, (13) UK (D1) = CKλK E λK D1 +DKλK E --λk D1 λK +B1K (D1), UK (−D2) = AKλK COSλK D2 −BKλK Sinord D2 λK λk λk (−d2), (14) When with all k ∈N λk +B1k (d1) ̸ = 0, λk λk λb2k ( - d2) ̸ = 0. (15) for functions (12), the conditions of the conjugation of UK (0+0) = uk (0–0), u′k (0+0) = u′k (0+0+0), uk ( 0–0). (16) Conditions (21) occur only when CK = AK +BK 2, DK = AK −BK 2. (17) substituting (13), (14) B (12), we get uk (t) = {ak m1k (t)+bk m2k (t), t> 0, ak n1k (t)+bk n2k (t) , t <0, (18) where M1k (t) = CHλK T - m̃1k λk B1k (t), m̃1k = λk CHλK D1 λK +B1k (D1), M2K (t) = SHλK T - M̃2K λK B1K (T) M̃2K = λk SHλK D1 λk + B1k (D1), N1K (T) = COSλK T + ñ1k λk B2K (t), ñ1k = λk cosord d2 λk λk λk (d2), n2k (t) = sinord t - ñ2k λk B2K (t), ñ2k = λk sinorda d2 λk λb2k (d2). 314 Materials of the International School-Conference to find constant AK and BK use the boundary conditions (5) and the formula (6): UK (β) = P 2 1 ’0 U (X, β) Sinords XD X = P 2 1 ° 0 ivil (X ) Sinorda xd x = ∗ (19) uk (−α) = p 2 1 1 − q, −α) sinordes xd x = p 2 1 ψ (x) sinordes xd x = ψk. (20) Satisfying the functions (24) to the boundary conditions (19) and (20), we find {ak m1k (β)+bk m2k (β) = ∗ n1k (−α)+bk n2k (−α) = ψk . (21) If the determinant of the system (21) for all k ∈N: ∆ (k) = n1k (−α) m2k (β) −n2k (−α) m1k (β) = (cosλkα+ ñ1k λk b2k (−α) ) M2K (β)++ (sinordα+ ñ2k λk b2k (−α)) m1k (β) = m2k (β) cosλkα+ m1k (β) sinordα++ ñ1k λk b2k (−α) m2k (β)+ ñ2k λk λ B2K (−α) m1k (β) ̸ = 0, (22) then it has the only solution ak = 1 ∆ (k) [ψk m2k (β) −con n2k (−α)], bk = 1 ∆ (k) [∗ n1k (−α) −ψk m1k (β)].
