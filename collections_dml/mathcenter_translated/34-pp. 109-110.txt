-The representative sets M.V. Zubkov Kazan State University definition. Infinite set A = {A0 <A1 <A2. . . }, A ⊂ ω is called strongly imaginary if there is a calculated linear order of the following type L: η + a0 + η + a1 + η + a2 + η +. . . Where η is a dense linear order. Rosenstein found that each strong η-representative set is ∆03-nomination. He proved that all σ 0 2 sets are strongly representative. Fellner is still the same for the π02-monk. Lerman built an example ∆ 0 3-many, which is not very contrasting. Dounini raised the question of the study of ∆03 degrees, which contain strongly contrasting sets. In particular, is it that every ∆03-spectacle contains a lot of η an individual? A negative answer to this question was received. Theorem 1. There is an inexpensive set of a ∈ ∆3, such that if B6TA and B are strongly representative, then B is computable. Theorem 2. If a is a strongly representable set, then there is a computable function F (t, i, s), such that a = ⋃و = 0 (a2i —2i+1), where ai = {t ∈ ω | lims f (t, i, s) = 1}, and 111 1) ∀i 6 = j [(a2i —a2i+1) ∩ (a2j —2j+1) = ∅]; 2) ∀x∃i∀j> i [x /∈ AJ].

Miftakhov Tatar Humanitarian and Pedagogical Universities, and Tatars Kazan, rustem_miftah@yahoo.ru in [1], [2] shows that the correct introduction of a scalar from the ugliness of particles into the relativistic theory of gravity when led to the change in the effective masses of particles: m ∗ = | m+ qφ |, where q is the scaly Particle charge, φ is the potential of the scalar field. Consider the resting degenerated gas in a stationary gravitational field, which is possible with l ă gik = 0; Φ cil = 0. With this gravitational field, the system is described only by one 112
