The boundary values ​​of polyanalytic functions, let the ANL2 (D) denotes the space of all nanalitic in the area d = {z: | z | <1} functions for which the norm is finite || F || 2, d = {∫ ∫ d | f (z) | 2 dxdy} 1/2 <mm. It is known that any function F ∈ ANL2 (D) is the only 188 way can be represented in the form (see [1]) f (z) = n∑ k = 1 ∂k - 1 ∂zk - 1 (1– ZZ) K −1fk - 1 (z)), (1) where fk -1 ∈ AL2 (D), K = 1, 2 ,. . . , n. As usual, hp (d), 1 ≤ p ≤ و, means the space of har di. Theorem. Let F ∈ Anl2 (D). Then ∫ ∫ D (1 - | z | 2) ∣∣∣∣ ∂f (z) ∂z ∣∣∣∣ 2 dxdy <mm⇔ fk -1 ∈ H2 (D), K = 1, 2 ,. . . n, and almost everywhere on ∂d there are angular boundary values ​​of the polyanalytic function F, moreover, f (ζ) = n∑ k = 1 (−1) k - 1 (k - 1)! ζk -1fk - 1 (ζ) , ζ ∈ ∂D. A similar statement is true for polyanalytic functions F, in which, in the view (1), all components FK -1, K = 1, 2,. . . , n, belong to the space H1 (D).

Rasulov (Smolensk) about the non -modified regional task of the Neumann type for meta -analytical functions, if+ - the final single -link area on the plane of the computer alks variable z = x+ iy, limited by a simple smooth closed contour L. through T - denote the addition of t+ ∪l To a complete integrated plane. Everywhere in the future we will use the designations and terminology adopted in [1]. The following regional task is considered. It is required to find all the meta -analytical functions of the F+(Z) class m2 (t+) ∩ h (2) (L), which satisfy on the lredit condition ∂f+(t) ∂n+g (t) f+(t) = g (t), (1) where ∂/∂n is a derivative of the internal normal, and G (t), G (t) - specified on L functions H (L). With G (t) ≡ 0, the task (1) is the task of the Neumann in the class of meta -analytical functions. Therefore, with G (t) 6 = 0, t ∈ L, the formulated task will be called a modified task of the type of neuman for meta -analytical functions. Moreover, if G (t) ≡ 0, the task (1) is called homogeneous. The task of the Neumann (i.e., the task (1) for G (t) ≡ 0) in the class of meta -analytical functions is not neter, since meta -analytical in the circle t+ = {z: | z | <1} functions f + (z) = (zn -1 + z̄zn) exp {λ0z̄}, where n is an arbitrary natural number, and λ0 - any integrated number, are solutions to a homogeneous problem of Neumann 190
