) The controllability of nonlinear equations we consider the equation dx - = a (t) x+ f (t, x, and), (1) dt where a (.): [T, RO) ~ Novop (RP, RP), FEC (p , q, r) ([t,+oo) xr "xrnxr") p ~ o, q ~ l, uec, k - class of permissible departments. Theorem. 1) There is a fundamental matrix y (t) equations DY = A (t) Y is such that lim y (t) = e, y (o) :: e and dt 1- ++ oo+<s F u- 1 (t) j (t, x (t), and (t)) DT exists with any and e and x e B; o +x 2) the equation f y- 1 (t) j (t, x, s) dt = C determines as implicit function and = u (t, x) for any C "; 3) and = u (t, x (t)) is permissible control at all.'i x E then equation (1) control. The obtained theorem follows the algorithm for finding about gram movements, which contains as a special case of the sulfate from work [1, p. 36]. Literature 1. Zubov V.I.
