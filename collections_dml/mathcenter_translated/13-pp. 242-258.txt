ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEMS  E. Volotskaya Kazan State University  We consider an economic application of the mixed variational inequality problem which involves a continuous mapping and a convex, but not necessarily differentiable function. We specialize several existence and uniqueness results for this problem and describe results of solving such a problem via the D-gap function approach.  1 Introduction  LetK and V be nonempty convex sets in the real Euclidean space Rn, K ⊆ V ; let f : V → R be a convex, but not necessarily differentiable function, and let G : V → Rn be a mapping. The mixed variational inequality problem (MVI for short) is the problem of finding x∗ ∈ K such that  〈G(x∗), x− x∗〉+ f(x)− f(x∗) ≥ 0 ∀x ∈ K. (1.1)  Problem (1.1) was originally considered by Lescarret [1] and Browder [2] and afterwards studied by many authors; e. g., see [3, 4]. It reduces to the usual variational inequality problem (VI for short) in the case where f ≡ 0. Most of the works are devoted to establish existence and uniqueness results for problem (1.1) under various assumptions on G and f and suggest solution methods.  This work is devoted to an economic application of MVI (1.1). Namely, we consider the economic equilibrium problem in the case where each i-th consumer demands a single commodity. We show that this problem can be reformulated as MVI of form (1.1) where the mapping G is M0. We present several existence and uniqueness results for this class of problems. In addition, properties obtained enable us to find a solution of MVI (1.1) with the help of the Dgap function approach, which was adjusted for such problems in [5, 6]. It consists in converting MVI (1.1) into the problem of finding a stationary point of a differentiable function. Therefore, one can  242    E.

In what follows, for a vector x ∈ Rn, x ≥ 0 (respectively, x > 0) means xi ≥ 0 (respectively, xi > 0) for all i = 1, . . . , n; Rn+ denotes the nonnegative orthant in Rn, i. e.,  Rn+ = {x ∈ Rn | x ≥ 0};  Rn> denotes the interior of R n +, i. e.,  Rn> = {x ∈ Rn | x > 0}.  We denote by In the identity map in R n, i. e. the n× n unit matrix.  For a set E, Π(E) denotes the family of all subsets of E.  2 Preliminaries  In this section, we recall several definitions and related properties of mappings.  Definition 2.1. [7, 8] An n× n matrix A is said to be (a) a P -matrix if it has positive principal minors; (b) a P0-matrix if it has nonnegative principal minors; (c) a Z-matrix if it has non-positive off-diagonal entries; (d) an M -matrix if it has non-positive off-diagonal entries and its  inverse A−1 exists and has non-negative entries.  It is well known that an n × n matrix A is P if and only if, for every vector x 6= 0, there exists an index k such that xkyk > 0 where y = Ax. Similarly, A is P0 if and only if, for every vector x, there exists an index k such that xkyk ≥ 0, xk 6= 0 where y = Ax. Also, it is well known that A is M if and only if A ∈ P ∩Z; see [7, 8]. Hence, each M -matrix is P , but the reverse assertion is not true in general.  Definition 2.2. [7, 8] An n × n matrix A is said to be an M0matrix if it is both P0- and Z-matrix.  The following proposition gives a criterion for a matrix A to be an M - or M0-matrix.  243    On a class of economic equilibrium problems  Proposition 2.1. [7] Suppose A is a Z-matrix. If there exists a vector x > 0 such that Ax > 0 (respectively, Ax ≥ 0), then A is an M -matrix (respectively, M0-matrix).  Now we recall extensions of these properties for mappings.  Definition 2.3. [9] Let U be a convex subset of Rn. A mapping F : U → Rn is said to be  (a) a P -mapping, if max 1≤i≤n  (xi − yi)(Fi(x) − Fi(y)) > 0 for all x, y ∈ U, x 6= y;  (b) a P0-mapping, if for all x, y ∈ U , x 6= y, there exists an index i such that xi 6= yi and (xi − yi)(Fi(x)− Fi(y)) ≥ 0.  (c) a uniform P -mapping, if there exists τ > 0 such that  max 1≤i≤n  (xi − yi)(Fi(x)− Fi(y)) ≥ τ‖x− y‖2  for all x, y ∈ U ;  If F is affine, i. e., F (x) = Ax + b, then F is a P -mapping (P0mapping) if and only if its Jacobian ∇F (x) = A is a P -matrix (P0matrix). In the general nonlinear case, if the Jacobian ∇F (x) is a P -matrix, then F is a P -mapping, but the reverse assertion is not true in general. At the same time, F is a P0-mapping if and only if its Jacobian ∇F (x) is a P0-matrix, e. g. see [6, 9, 10].  Definition 2.4. (e. g., see [4, 11, 12]) Let U be a convex subset of Rn. A mapping Q : U → Π(Rn) is said to be  (a) strongly monotone with constant τ > 0, if for all u′, u′′ ∈ U and q′ ∈ Q(u′), q′′ ∈ Q(u′′), we have  〈q′ − q′′, u′ − u′′〉 ≥ τ‖u′ − u′′‖2;  (b) strictly monotone, if for all u′, u′′ ∈ U , u′ 6= u′′ and q′ ∈ Q(u′), q′′ ∈ Q(u′′), we have  〈q′ − q′′, u′ − u′′〉 > 0;  (c) monotone, if for all u′, u′′ ∈ U and q′ ∈ Q(u′), q′′ ∈ Q(u′′), we have  〈q′ − q′′, u′ − u′′〉 ≥ 0.  244    E
