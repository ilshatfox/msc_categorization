UDC 517 inequalities for the expanded positive part of the algebra von Neumann associated with the surgical monotonous and surgical convex functions of L.V. Veselova1, Chung Hoa Ding2, O.E.

This makes it possible, in particular, to extend the inequalities to unlimited positive self -combined operators. Keywords: algebra von Neumann, an extended positive part, an operator monotonous function, an operational convex function. Everywhere in this note, M denotes the algebra von Neumann, m+ - its positive part, m+ ∗ - a cone of positive normal functionals on m. Symbol S → We denote the convergence in strong operator topology. Determination 1. [5] Borelev function F: R+→ R+, limited on the limited subset R+, is called a monotonous surgical relative to M (or, briefly, m -monotone), if a, b ∈M+, a ≤ b = ⇒ F ( A) ≤ f (b). (1) Such a function F is called m -spray [2] if a, b ∈M+, 0 ≤α≤ 1 = ⇒ F (αa+ (1–α) b) ≤α f (a)+ (1–α) f (b). (2) everywhere below r+∪ {+urb} is indicated through R+. L.V. Veselova, Chung Hoa Din, O.E. Tikhonov 87 Determination 2. [3] with an extended positive part M̂+ algebra of the neuman -m background is called a set of display m: m+ ∗ → r+, satisfying the conditions: (i) m (λ ventration) = λm (∗), onic+ ∗, λ ≥ 0 (where 0 · (+∞) = 0); (ii) m (∗+ψ) = m (lus)+m (ψ), onic, ψ ∈M+∗; (III) M semi -intake from below. It is clear that M+ can be considered as a subset of m̂+. Moreover, many positive self -combined operators attached to M can be identified with the subset of M̂+ [6, example IX.4.5]. At the same time, M̂+ is closed relative to addition, multiplication by non -negative numbers and limits of increasing networks [3], [6, p. 215]. For m ∈ M̂+ and C ∈ M, the element C ∗ mc is determined by the ratio (C ∗ mc) (lus) = m (c accord ∗), where c 8c ∗ = onic (c ∗ · c). According to [6, theorem IX.4.8], each element m ∈ M̂+has the only spectral decomposition of the type M (gment) = ∫+ger 0 λD accord (EM (λ))+· · ° (PM), onic+∗, where {em (λ): λ ∈ R+} is a strongly continuous right of the growing family of projectors from m and pm = 1 - lim λ →+ger em (λ). For a limited Borelev function F: R + → R, we determine the self -consolidated operator F (M) by M by means of the formula gment ϕ (F (m)) = ∫ + ger 0 F (λ) dwor (EM (λ)) + F ( + urb ) onic (pm) (onic ∈M+∗). Similarly, for the Borelev function f: r+ → r+ we determine the formula onic (f (m)) = ∫+ nder 0 f (λ) dwor (em (λ))+ f (+ urb) onic (PM) (∗ ∈M+∗). It is easy to make sure that f (m) is an element m̂+. The main goal of this note is to show how the inequalities of monotony (1) and bulge (2) can be expanded from M+ on m̂+. Theorem 1. Let the function F: R+ → R+ such that its restriction on R+ sets R+ in R+, is Monotone and F (+ ∞) ≥ Lim λ →+ ger F (λ). Then f (m ′) ≤ f (m ′ ′) for any m ′, m ′ ′ ∈ M̂+ such that m ′ ≤ m ′ ′. This theorem is a generalization of the theorem 5 of the work [2]. The next statement summarizes and clarifies Hansen's theorem from [4]. 88 Materials of the School Conference Condition. Let the function F: R+ → R+ such that its restriction on R+ dures R+ in R+ is the monotonous relative relative to M ⊗ B (H2) and F (+ ∞) ≥ Lim λ →+ ger F (λ). Then C ∗ F (M) C ≤ F (C ∗ MC). For any m ∈ M̂+ and C ∈M with ∥c∥ ≤ 1. Theorem 2. Let the function f: r+ → r+ such that its restriction on R+ raises R+ in R+ is a swollen and f (+ urb) = LIM λ →+ger F (λ). Then f (αm ′+ (1–α) m ′ ′) ≤α f (m ′)+ (1–α) f (m ′ ′) for any m ′, m ′ ′ ∈ M̂+ and α ∈ [0 ,one]. We emphasize that for unlimited positive self -consolidated operators, the formulation of the inequalities of convexity leads to the concept of an extended positive part, since the convex combination of unlimited positive self -combined operators cannot, generally speaking, correctly defined as a densely given operator. In case of proof of theorem 2, we significantly used the proposal below, the condition (I) in which is a certain analogue of a strong resolved gathering
