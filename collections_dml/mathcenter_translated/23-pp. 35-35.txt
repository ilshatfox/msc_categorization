) Some tasks of the theory of conformal displays of surfaces consider the issues of existence, uniqueness and stability relative to small deformations of conformal display of irregular surfaces. Some estimates of the relative distance of M. A. Lavrentiev and assessments of the distortion of the area with such display are given. Applications are indicated to the problem of compliance of the boundaries. Yu. V. Obnosov (Kazan, Yobnosov@ksu.ru) Effective characteristics of some periodic multiphase heterogeneous structures in the work considered various dense parquet coatings of the plane. Physical processes in the corresponding pieces-it 37
