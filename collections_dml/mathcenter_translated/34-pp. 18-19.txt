. Description of the infinitely differentiated functions of N. T. Akhtyamov Samara State Academy of Railways, a branch in Ufa, let ∗: R → R is a convex function, and with some µ, ν, such that 1 <µ 6 ν < ∞, and some positive A, B, C, D everywhere on R are the inequality A | x | µ —B 6 onic (x) 6 c | ν +D. Let W - non -negative continuous function on [0; + ∞), such that 1) log (1 + r) = o (w (r)), r → urb; 2) W (R2) 6 A+BW (R), R> 0, where A and B are some positive constant. For each M ∈ N, we introduce the normalized space EM (∗, W) = {F ∈ CM (R): QM (F) = SUP X∈R, K6M | F (K) (X) | Exp (wor (x) −mw (| x |)) <mm}. Let e ​​(gment, w) - the projective limit of the spaces EM (lus, w). We denote through E ∗ (∗, W) a strong conjugated space to E (lus, W). 20 Let Сory ∗ - a family of functions ∗ ∗ m (x) = sup yorn (xy - С (y)), x ∈ R, m ∈ N, p (∗ ∗, w) - inductive limit of the spaces P (∗ ∗ m, w) = {f ∈ H (c): || f || m = sup zăc | f (z) | (1 + | z |) m of (∗ ∗ (Im z) + mw (p iry z)) <urb}. Theorem. Display l: s ∈ E ∗ (onic, w) → <s, exp (−iising)> establishes the topological isomorphism of the spaces e ∗ (gment) and p (∗ ∗, w). Comment. For the case when W (r) = log (1+r), and the function wor meets only the inequality ffic (x)> a | x | µ −b for x ∈ R, the corresponding result was obtained in [1]. L and T R A T R A 1. Musin I.Kh.
