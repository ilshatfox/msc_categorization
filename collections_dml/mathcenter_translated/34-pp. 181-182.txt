Calculating the claws of algebr Lee D.V. Reshetnikov Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, Genserg@hotmail.com The second group of claws of classic algebrons Lee with the EPRICTIONS in the attached module in the characteristic P = 2 was found for algebrus with a homogeneous system of Cor Chebochko [2]. The calculation of the second group of whom the monitoring for the rest of the classic algebrus Lee is a great difficulty. A software complex was developed for calculating the HN (l; m) of an arbitrary final algebra Lee L with the coefficients in the final module M for the case of the specified structural constants L and M. In addition, the graduated algebra L and the graduated module of the module M provides for the possibility of simplifying the calculations Due to the graduation on claws. The results of a numerical experiment for claws of the class of the Syatic algebris of the CN series, N 6 8 showed that the dimension of the Crumology group H2 (L) is 2N2 +5N - 1, where n is the rank of algebra L, and the basic cockers deliver the following weights (in designations [1]): 1. For µ = 0, we have dimh2µ (l; l) = n - 1; 183 2. For µ = ± 2εi, 1 6 i 6 n, we have dimh2µ (l; l) = 3; 3. For µ = ± 2 (εi + εj), 1 6 i <j 6 n, we have DIMH2µ (L) = 1; 4. For µ = ± 2 (εi - εj), 1 6 i <j 6 n, we have dimh2µ (l; l) = 1. For a series of BN clamology, they were calculated only for Al Goebr rank n = 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 6 and 7, while h2 (l; l) = 0, if N 6 = 4.
