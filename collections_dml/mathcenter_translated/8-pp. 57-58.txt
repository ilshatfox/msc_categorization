) Some maximum theorems for measures on hyperbolic logic in this message on W ising algebra are summarized by two limit theorems proved by M. S. Matveychuk [1], [2] for the case of W ∗ J -factors. We adhere to the designations and terminology of work [3]. Theorem 1. Let the PU -the set of all U -sample projectors from semi -pointed w ∗ u -algebrym without a direct component type in, n ≤ 4 and let µn: pu → R -sequence of indepinite measures. Suppose that for any projector p ∈ Pu there is the final limit µ (p): = lim n → φ µn (p). Then τ (pα) → α 0 entails ‖pα‖ - 1µn (pα) → α 0 evenly by n. If, in addition, M is the final algebra, then µ: PU → R is an indepinite measure. 57 For semi -traces on PU Pu theorem 1 takes the following form. Drying 2. Let in the assumptions of theorem 1 µn - a sequence of half -traces. Then for any ∗ u -algebras, the limit function µ is also half a trace. M. S. Matveychuk studied the measure on the ideal of orthoprojectors. The next theorem shows that for the semi -ended W ∗ u -algebra m, the many PFU PFU PFU P ∈ Pu, for which the subspace p, of course, can serve as a hyperbolic analogue of the ideal. Indefinite measure µ: pfu → R will call the final if for any projector p ∈ (p+u ∪ p --u) the inequality of SUP {| µ (q) | : q ≤ p, q ∈ P f u}. Theorem 3. Let the semi -pointedw ∗ u -albur, which does not have a direct component type in, n ≤ 4. Then any final indepinite measure µ: pfu → R continues to all logic PU to an indepinite measure.
