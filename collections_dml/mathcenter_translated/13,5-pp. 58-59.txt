) The regional task of the Riemann for the ranalitic function on an indestructible spiral circuit considers the regional task of the Riemann F + (t) = G (t) G (t) + G (t), t e l, g (t) = g (t), (1) 58 for pnalytic function f (z, z) = and (x, y)+ IV (x, y), such that di ldv di dx = ode 'du = -rdh' in the case when The curve L has the form: l = {t: t = t (s) = r (s) exp [ib (s)], s e [o, oo)}, (2) where s is arc abscissa, r (s )> O, lish, _.+00 r (s) = o, lish8 _,+00 b (s) =+oo. The method that reduces the task (1) to the Riman IP 1 (t) = g (t) l {j- (t)+g1 (t), tel, (3) for the analytical function l {j (z) . In the case of endless spirals of L, the task (2), the task was investigated by the author earlier. A general solution to the problem (1) was obtained in the form: p+l p -1f (z, z) = 2PL {j (z) - 2PL {j (z), where l {j (z) is a general solution to the problem (3) . The conditions are indicated by which the functions G (t), G (t) must be satisfied. It is shown that these conditions are significantly dependent on R Â· Eometry of the contour L. E.V. Zakharova (Nizhny Novgorod) about the spectra of periodic strip operators generated by recurrent ratios of the highest order, vector orthogonal polynomials play an important role in the tasks of joint rational approximations of analytical functions [1]. In recent years, it has been noted that such polynomials are useful in the study of some nonlinear chains of mathematical physics [2]. [3] proposed a general approach to decision 59
