Elshenavi1, E.A. Shirokova2 1 atallahtm@yahoo.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky 2 Elena.shirorova@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky is proposed to the method of a close solution of a two -dimensional problem of theadirichel for the Laplace equation in the double areas using the Cosa integral. A harmonic function near the boundaries is approximated by a linear function. Keywords: Integral Koshi, a two -dimensional task of a conductor, a two -link area. Let ω - the double region, ∂ω = l0 ∪ l1 - the smooth boundary of this area. Suppose that the border consists of an external smooth curve L0: z0 (t), t ∈ [0.2π], which is circumventing the growth T in the direction of the clockwise, and the internal smooth curve l1: z1 (t), t ∈ [0, 2π], bypassing clockwise. Then the corresponding two -dimensional task for the Equal Plasselapis equation is to be differently differentiated into ω function u (x, y), continuous in ω∪∂ω and satisfying the Laplace equation ∂2u (x, y) ∂x2 + ∂ 2u (x, y) ∂y2 = 0, (x, y) ∈ω, (1) and boundary conditions: u (x (t), y (t)) = {f0 (t), (x (t), y (t)) ∈ L0; F1 (t), (x (t), y (t)) ∈ L1; t ∈ [0.2π]. (2) In [1], the solution to this problem was searched in the form of an integral cat. The method reduces the task to the integral equation of Fredgolm of the second kind for the boundary values ​​of the conjugated harmonic function and then converts the integral equation into a truncated linear system. The solution of the integral equation has the form of Polynoma Fourier. Finally, the solution of the problem of the conductor is a real part of the Cosa integral. Due to the singularity of the integral of the cats at points near the boundaries, we introduce a new technique to build an approximate solution at these points. An approximate solution to the problem of the conductor at points near the boundaries is a linear function. We determine the borders of the curves shown in Fig. 1: zε j (t) = z j (t)+0.5i r j z ′ j (t) | z ′ j (t) | , j = 0.1, here r j, j = 0.1 is the minimum value of the radius of the curvature of the boundary with the equations of the curves Z J (t), j = 0.1. We denote the approximate solution at the points of the curves Zε J (t), j = 0.1, calculated by the integral by the COSHI, through UOε J (t), j = 0.1, t ∈ [0.2π]. A. Elshenavi, E.A. Beskova 161 We denote through ω̃ the area with the boundaries of Zε J (t). For points of the region ω \ ω̃, the solution of the problem of the conductor is approximated by linear functions as follows. Firstly, we are building for each point located between the congress crooked Z J (t) and zε j (t), the line of the straight line, perpendicular to the congruent curve Z J (t) and zε j (t) and providing the projection of the point on these curves: z j (z j (t0) and zε j (t0). Secondly, we calculate the approximate solution of the problem of the conductor at this point by substituting in the line equations as follows: uζ = uε j (t0)-f j (t0) zε j (t0)-z j (t0) (ζ-z j (t0)) + f j (t0), j = 0.1. (3) −1. 1. The boundary curves Z J (t) and zε j (t), j = 0.1. The integral method of Koshi in combination with the proposed technique was applied to the double -ivated area with the unfortunate boundaries shown in the figure (1). The boundaries consisted of two parametric curves: z0 (t) = −0.5 +ei t +0.5e2i t +0.2i e - 2i t, t ∈ [0.2π], z1 (t) = 0.2i +0.5e --i t −0.25 E-2i t +0.1i e2i t, t ∈ [0.2π].
