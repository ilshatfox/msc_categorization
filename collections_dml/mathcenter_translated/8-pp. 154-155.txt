) The task of diffraction of waves on periodic structures with a deformed section proposed a method for analyzing diffraction phenomena that occur when a flat electromagnetic wave falls on a periodic grill [1] containing a limited area with other characteristics than that of the lattice. An example of such structures are lattices with a partially deformed profile (see [2]). The mathematical model is built in the form of a non -self -intended regional task for the Helmholtz equation with a conductor of 154 le or a neuman at the border, the condition on the rib [1] in the singular points of the border and the partial condition at infinity [3]. With the help of work technology [4], on the basis of the apparatus of boundary integral equations and the theory of periodic gratings, the properties of generalized potentials, as well as the results of work [5], the classical resolution of model regional tasks has been proved. Developed and, on the basis of the work methodology [6], the theoretically substantiated methods of the approximate solution of the examination problems in question. L and T R A T R A 1.
