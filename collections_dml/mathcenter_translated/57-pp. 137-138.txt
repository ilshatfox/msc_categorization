A single -parametric families and the conformal module of the region, which is the appearance of two segments of D.N. Dautova, S.R. Nasyrov, M. Wurorinen, we study single -parametric families of areas on the plane, which are the appearance of two segments, and we get a formula for the variation of the conformal module of these areas. A system of differential equations was also obtained to determine the parameters in the integral representation of the functions that carry out conformal display of the rings in the family. Key words: conformal module, container, elliptical function. UDC 517.518 On stabilization of solutions of non -verbal parabolic equations with the growing senior coefficients of V.N. Denisov1 1 vdenisov2008@yandex.ru; Moscow State University. M.V. Lomonosov studies the exact sufficient conditions for the order of growth of the senior coefficients of the non -verbal parabolic equation of the second order, in which the solution to the Koshi problem stabilizes to zero at exponential speed, evenly X at each compact K in RN. Key words: parabolic equations, solving the problem of Koshi, stabilization. In the semi -space E = rn × [0, least), N ê 3 consider the task of the cat lu ≡ l1u +c (x) u che = 0, in e, (1) u (x, 0) = u0 (x), x ∈ Rn, (2) where l1u = n∑ i, k = 1 ai k (x) u ′ ′ xi xk. It is assumed that the following conditions are fulfilled: 1) coefficients B (1) are valid and continuous in RN, and satisfy the Helder condition in each limited personality D in RN, AI K = AKI, (I, K = 1, N., N ), there are positive constant λ0, λ1, such that λ20b (| x |) | ctor | 2 é n∑ i, k = 1 ai k (x) oring éλ21b (| x |) | ă 2, (3) For ∀x, ă ∈ Rn, b (| x |) = (1+ | x | 2) m, 0 <m <1/2, | x | = x21 + ... + x2n. (4) 138 Materials of the School-Conference 2) The coefficient C (X) B (1) satisfies the condition (C): there is constant β> 0 that C (X) é -β2, ∀x ∈ Rn. 3) the initial function U0 (x) is continuous in RN and the condition is fulfilled limited | U0 (x) | É m. (5) The following statement is true. Theorem. If u (x, t) is the solution to the problem (1), (2) with the initial function (2), which satisfies (5), the conditions (3), (4) at 0 <m <1/2, and the coefficient (coefficient (4) are met x) satisfies the condition (c) forβ> 0, then for solving the problem (1), (2) the inequality | U (x, t) | É m1 exp (−bt 1 n), t ê t1> 0, evenly in X on each compact k in rn, where m1 = m (k), b = b (k, λ0, λ1, β), 1 n = 1–2m 3–2m. Comment. The theorem is accurate in the sense that it is impossible to replace the compact with RN in its affirmation. The work on stabilizing the solutions of parabolic equations is devoted to work [1]. Asymptotic solutions with growing coefficients was studied in the works [2], [3]. Asymptotic solutions of nonlinear parabolic equations were studied, for example, in [4]. The work was carried out with financial support for the Russian Scientific Fund (project No. 19-11-00223).
