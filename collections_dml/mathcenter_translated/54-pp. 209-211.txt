The fundamental principle in the invariant subspace O.A. Krivosheev1 1 kriolesya2006@yandex.ru; Bashkir State University in the work studies complex sequences of the first order with the final maximum angular density. The criterion was obtained when such a sequence is part of a properly distributed set with a given angular density. On this basis, complete decisions of the problematic principle and basis for the invariant subspace of analytical functions in a limited convex region are given. Key words: invariant subspace, basis, fundamental principle. Let D - convex region in c, h (d) - the space of the functions in D, with the topology of uniform convergence on the compacts, and λ = λk, nk} - the sequence of complex numbers λk and their multiples nk are such that the system e ( Λ) = {znexp (λk z)}, k ≥ 1, n = 0 ,. . . , nk −1, not full in h (d). Through W (λ, d), we denote the closure in H (D) of the linear shell of the E (λ) system. Then W (λ, d) is a non -trivial closed subspace in h (d), invariant relative to the differentiation operator (λ is its multiple spectrum, and e (λ) - a set of own and attached functions in W (λ, d)). Let λ̃ = {µm, SM} ger = 1. We will say that λ̃ is the replenishment − Pul <2π. The symbol n (∗1, ∗2, r, λ) is denoted by the number of points λk, taking into account their multiplications that have fallen into the sector {λ = teiphous: onic ∈ (∗1, ∗2), t ∈ (0, R)}. They say ([1], chap. II, § 1) that λ has an angular density (in order of one), if for all 8, ∗2 except, perhaps the counting set exists the limit of n (°1, ∗2, λ) = limr → و (∗, ∗2, r, λ)/r. Put N0 (∗1, ∗2, λ) = limδ → 0Limr → mit n (∗1, ∗2, r, λ) −n (∗1, ∗2, (1–af) R, λ) ΔR. Many λ is called correctly distributed (see [1], chap. II, § 1) if it has an angular density and a Lindelaf condition is fulfilled, i.e. There is a limit of Limr → ° ∑ | λk | <r nk /λk. Properly distributed sets are closely related to regular growth functions. Let F - a whole function of the exponential type (i.e. there are a, b> 0 such that | f (z) | ≤ a +b | z |, z ∈ C). The upper indicator F is the function H F (λ) = Lim T → ger LN | f (tλ) |/t, λ ∈C. The H F indicator is a convex positively uniform with a function that coincides with the complex support function of a certain convex compact K (i.e., with the usual support function of a comprehensively associated with k compact), called the conjugated diagram f (see, for example, [2] , chap. I, § 5, theory 210 Materials of the International School-Conference MA 5.4): h f (λ) = hk (λ) = sup zlex re (λz), λ ∈C. They say (see [1], chap. III) that F has regular growth if h f (λ) = lim t → ∞, t∉e ln | f (tλ) |/t, λ ∈C, where E is a lot of zero relative measures on the beam (0,+∞), i.e. The measure of the Lebbeg of its intersection with the interval (0, r) is infinite in comparison with R with R →+urb. Let K - convex compact and z1, z2 - points of its border ∂k. Through S (Z1, Z2, K), we denote the length of the arc ∂K, connecting Z1 and Z2, the movement along which from Z1 to Z2 is carried out in a negative direction (clockwise). For each ∗ ∈ R, the intersection γ (lus) of the supporting line l (gment) = {z: re (zei pul) = hk (ei accord) and the borders ∂k is either a point z (gment) or a segment. A lot of φ (k) directions ∗, for which γ (∗) is a segment, nothing more than counting. Put SK (∗1, ∗2) = SUP z1] ​​(lus), z2️γ (Сory) s (z1, z2, k). The function SK (fficuns, ∗2) is non -flowing in ising and non -growing in ising, and many of its gap points in both alternating coincides with theφ (k). If 8, ∗2 ∈ (K), then SK (∗, ∗2) = S (z (∗1), z (∗2), k). According to the theorem 4 of chapter III of the book [1], the function F has regular growth and only when its zero set is correctly distributed. In this case, for all ∗1, ∗2 ∉φ (k), 0 <∗2 – pul, the equality is true (see [1], chap. II, § 1, formula (2.07)) n (∗1, ∗2, λ̃) = SK (∗1, ∗2)/2π, (1) where k is a conjugated diagram, and λ̃ is a multiple zero set F. Theorem 1. Let λ = {λk, nk} and k - convex compact. The statements are equivalent to: 1) there is γ> 0 that for all ∗, ∗2 ∉ φ (k) with condition 0 <∗2 – pulp the inequality N0 (∗1, ∗2, λ) ≤ sk (nger, nger)/2π is performed. . 2) there is a replenishment of λ̃ sequence λ, which is a correctly distributed set, and at the same time correct (1). Let theλ = {λk, nk} and d are a limited convex area. Recall (see [3]) that the sequence λ is compatible with D, if it is part of the zero set (taking into account the multiples of NK) of the whole function F of the exponential type and regular growth, the conjugated diagram of which is the closing of D̄ area D (i.e. h f = hd̄ = hd). Let k = d̄. If λ̃ is a properly distributed replenish λ, satisfying (1), then its canonical function F has an indicator H F, coinciding with HD̄ (see [1], chap. II, theorem 4). It follows that the statement 2) theorem 1 equivalent to compatibility λ with the area D. Thus, the investigation is true. The following approved
