Problems of the centralization of the Internet of things and their solutions to the Internet of things (IV) are an environment in which unique identifiers are assigned different objects (including animals and people) and the possibility of transmitting data through the network without the requirement of a man -man or a person - a person - computer (see, for example, [1]). To create IV networks, it is necessary to solve a number of problems whose operation is: determining the rules for providing access to data (sensors) and control rights of control funds (devices), determining the rules for registering but devices on the IV network, etc. These tasks, these tasks, As a rule, they are in the local means of companies, etc., due to limited access to the created technologies, organizing an intranet instead of the Internet of things [2]. Even taking into account the unifying standards of the Consortass of the mind A-Iot [3] Modern created protocols, such as a pitch, are guided by the presence of some user management services on the network [4], the general collection and processing of possible problems in the network, excessive loads on Similar vital services. To increase the failure tolerance of IV networks, their decentralization is necessary - the translation of computing loads to the network of devices itself (foggy calculations [5]), as well as the introduction of the protocols of the reinforcement, authentication, authorization and identification of devices based on the solutions of the Internet agents themselves 158 A.A. Feranets of things. As the basis for the proposed protocols, the ideas of the security system Alljoyn Security 2.0 [6] with various types of access control lists (ACL) are taken [7, 8]. To abandon the single service of Security Manager, offered in the framework, a description of trust levels is used. A thin access system is introduced to individual components from the outside of roles. The system determines the main torture of actions related to the security system and the categories of typical actions related to the main functionality. Based on the categorizes described above, algebra of decisions of the IV network agents was introduced, which allows you to abandon the centralized approach or reduce the influence of central services in the EV networks. Due to the flexible approach in the description of the decision of decisions, compatibility with existing security organization systems is possible. The work was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan (project No. 15-47-02472). L and T R A T R A 1.
