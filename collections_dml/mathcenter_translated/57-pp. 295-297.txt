The task of the Keldysh for the mixed type equation with a characteristic degeneration in the rectangular area of ​​Yu.K. Sabitova1 1 sabitovauuk@rambler.ru; Sterlitamak branch of the Bashkir State University for the equation of mixed elliptic - hyperbolicotype with a characteristic degeneration, the task of the cellwater in a rectangular field has been studied. The solution was built in the form of a number of a row. Theorems of the uniqueness and existence of a solution to the problem have been proven. Keywords: an equation of a mixed type with characteristic degeneration, the task of the Keldysh, unity, existence, series, assessments, uniform convergence. For the equation of mixed elliptic-hyperbolic type lu = uxx + (sgn y) y uy y + auy −b2u = 0 (1) in the rectangular region d = {(x, y) | 0 <x <l, −α <y <β}, where l> 0, α> 0, β> 0, a> 1, b - set actual numbers, set the following task. The task of the Keldysh. Find the function u (x, y) that satisfies the following conditions: u (x, y) ∈C (d) ∩c 1x (d) ∩c 2 (d+∪d -); (2) lu (x, y) ≡ 0, (x, y) ∈ D+∪d -; (3) u (0, y) = u (l, y) = 0, −α≤ y ≤β; (4) u (x, β) = f (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ l, (5) where D - = D ∩ {Y <0}, D+ = D ∩ {Y> 0}, F (X) - a given rather smooth function that satisfies the condition f (0) = f (l) = 0. M.V. Keldysh [1] first examined a more general elliptical equation than equation (1) with Y> 0, second -order from two variables with characteristic degeneration. He showed that the correctness of the first boundary task significantly depends on the indicator of the degree of degeneration and the coefficient with the younger derivative of the UY. Based on this work, I.L. Karol [2] investigated the task of the trips for the mixed type equation (1) at b = 0 in the region of G, where G is the area of ​​the XOY plane, limited by the simple gordanus curve γ, which lies in half -plate y> 0, with the ends of O (0, (0, 0) and a (1.0), the characteristics of OC and AC equations located in the half -plate Y <0. I.L. Karol proved that the nature of the marginal tasks that can be set for equation (1) in the region of G, in contrast to equations with non -characteristic degeneration, depends significantly on the coefficient A and the class of solutions of the equation (1). For example, the classical task of the Triopom in the case of A <0 is undefined, at A> 0 - redefined. Based on work [3] - [8], we solve the problem of the Keldysh in the rectangular area for the equation (1). The solution was built in the form of a number of a row. The theorems of the uniqueness and existence of the solution of the problem (2) - (5) are proved. 296 Materials of the School-Conference Solution of the problem (2)-(5) built in the form of the sum of a row u (x, y) = √ 2 l ux k = 1 uk (y) sin πk l x. (6) In the formula (6), the UK (Y) function is determined by the formula UK (y) =   fk (y β) 1 - a 2 IA -1 (pk y 1 2) IA −1 (pkβ 1 2), y ≥ 0, fk (—Y β) 1 - a 2 ja -1 (pk (—Y) 1 2) IA -1 (pkβ 1 2), y ≤ 0, where fk = √ 2 l l∫ 0 f (x) sinorda xd x, pk = 2 √ b2 +λ2 k, ia -1 (pk y 1 2) - the modified function of the first -kind submarine, ja -1 (pk (—Y) 1 2) - The function of the plot of the first kind. Solution U (x, y) problems (2) - (5) satisfies the conditions: lim x → l+0 ux (x, y) sin πk l x = lim x → l --0 ux (x, y) sin πk l x = 0, 0 ≤ Y ≤β. (7) The following statements have been proved. Theorem 1. If there is a solution to the problem (2) - (5) that satisfies the conditions (7), then it is the only one. Theorem 2. If the function f (x) ∈ C 3 [0, l] and conditions F (0) = f (l) = 0, f ′ ′ (0) = f ′ (l) = 0, then exists The only solution to the problem (2) - (5) and this solution is determined nearby (6). If instead of the condition (5), set the boundary condition on the lower base of the rectangle u (x, −α) = G (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ l, then the function uk (y) in the formula (6) will have the form UK (Y) =   −GK (y α) 1 - a 2 IA -1 (pk y 1 2) ja -1 (pkα 1 2), y ≥ 0, gk (—Y α) 1 --a 2 ja -1 (pk (—Y) 1 2) ja -1 (pkα 1 2), y ≤ 0, where gk = √ 2 l l∫ 0 g (x) sinorda xd x. This formula shows that the function uk (y) → → with k → و and fixed y> 0. Therefore, it will not be possible to show the uniform convergence of the row (6). The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (project 183100111 mol_a). R.G. Salakhudinov 297 Literature 1.
