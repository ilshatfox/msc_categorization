) The equality of the Fourier rows by the systems of trigonometric polynomas, orthogonal with weights without the features of the {φn (θ)} φn = 0-orthonormated on [0, 2π] with 2π-periodic weight ffic (τ) the system of trigonometric polynomas obtained from the sequence of 1 , cos τ, sin τ, cos 2τ, sin 2τ. . . The method of orthogonalization of Schmidt. If Fier ∈ L1, then the amount of Fourier S accord, n (f; θ): =: = 1 2π ∫ 2π 0 f (τ) n∑ k = 0 θ) φk (τ) onic (τ) dτ ( n ∈ Z+, θ ∈ R). (1) 32 Obviously, S1.2N (F; θ) is the usual amount of Fourier SN (F; θ). For f ∈ Lux, we put ω (f; δ): = SUP | λ | ≤δ ‖ (· + λ) - f (·) ‖ fine. Equality of the amount (1) with SN (F; θ) for f ∈ Lux was studied in [1], [2]. Consider the case f ∈ L1. Theorem. If the weight mon (τ) is strictly positive, continuously differentiate and ∫ π 0 ω (onic ′; τ) τ -1 dτ <mm, then there is a constant C1 (∗)> 0 such that for all f ∈ L1, n ∈ Z+ and θ ∈ R | s accord, 2n (f; θ) - sn (f; θ) | ≤ c1 (∗) ‖f‖1. (2) The norm is ‖f‖1 in (2) can be replaced by the best approximation F in L1 trigonometric polynomas of the order no higher than N.
