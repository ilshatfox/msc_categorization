The ratios of the spaces of infinitely differentiated periodic functions examine the spaces of infinitely differentiated periodic (period 2π) for all variable (n ≥ 1) functions with the final metric winger {aα, p} ≡ ≡ ≡ {u (x) ∈ Cinger (t n): ρ (u) ≡ φ∑ | α | = 0 aα || dαu (x) || pp <urb}. (1) here {aα ≥ 0} is a numerical sequence, α = (α1,., Αn)-integer multi-core, 1 ≤ p <mm, tn-n-dimee it, || · || P is the norm in the space of the LP (TN) Lebag. Space (1) is called non -trivial if it is endlessly and tightly in L2 (TN). For this, as shown by Yu. A. Dubinsky [1], it is necessary and enough for lim | α | → mit a1/| α = 0. (2) for space (1) and similarly to the determined space winger {Bα , p} (t n) Condition (2) is supposed to be completed. Two methods of constructing a regularized N-dimensional matrix {a (1) α> 0 for all α} are proposed that the spaces are wyunt {aα, p} (t n) and winger {a (1) α, p} (t n) coincide, i.e. Mutual investments take place. The first method is based on the assessment of the norms of mixed derivatives through the norms of derivatives for one variable in LP (TN), the second - on the representation of each element Aα by the amount of n∑ j = 1 b (j) α and further regulatory of one -dimensional sequences from the components and lines separately the method proposed by the author in [2]. 35
