) The spatial analogue of the MS problem for one hyperbolic equation with two degeneration planes for the equation l (and) = and n ': + (2; 2 of them: -(2a (x) _; = zj2 u_v: = o x -z X -z - 0 <a, f3 <1, a+f3 <1 on the set of g = g- u g ", where g" with the border y = o, z = x - y, z = o, x = h; g with the border at = O, z = x +y, z = o, x = h, (h> o) is considered. (1) The task of MS: on the set, find the solution of equation (1) of the fissure in G, belonging to class 1 R in areas G ", G-, in the led by how it is done in the work [1], subordinating to the conditions: and (x, y, x- y) = r 1 (x, y), u (h, y, z) = QJ 1 (y, z), and (x, y, x-+-y) = r 2 (x, y), and (h, y, z) = qj 2 (y, z), o s s. x s h; osysh-z, oszsh os-ysxsh; about s z s h. On p. 1 of the tender U = o, the conditions of the mating are performed: lim (and, .- they) = lim (and,+IU). U-> 0-0 . U-> 0-0 The work indicates restrictions on the regional functions in which the existence and unity of the decision of the dacha set for the summer cottage. Literature 1.
