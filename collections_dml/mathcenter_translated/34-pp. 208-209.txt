The influence of the structure of forces on the stability of the system A. E. Fedorov Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, alexander.fedorov@intel.com Body carrier, is hung in the field of the same motionless spot or evenly charged ring, so that in a state of balance, the charges are on the same vertical. The equilibrium of the system is stable in vertical z = z0, x = y = 0, α = β = 0 (x, y, z - the coordinates of the center of inertia of the body. Α, β - angles characterizing the position of the axis of the body, E - charge, m - body weight, a is the distance from the center of inertia to the charge), unstable in the plane of the perpendicular direction of gravity and in angular coordinates. We bring into rotation the hanged body with the corner soon stu ω. The mathematical model of the object under consideration in linear approximation after the transition to the dimensionless coor of the dinata is a system of equations α̈ = - δ x --hβ̇ + χ = –δ y + hα̇ + χβ, ẍ = x - δ α, ÿ = y - Δ β . (1) Here δ = a/l ∗, χ = (z0δ)/l ∗, h = (c/a) ω0, a, c are the moments of body inertia. t ∗, l ∗ - the scale of time and coordinates is composed in conjunction. 210 According to Kelvin's theorem [2], a conservative system with an even degree of instability can be stabilized by the introduction of gyroscopic forces [3]. This theorem is proven in front of the position that the determinant of the matrix of gyroscopic forces is not equal to zero. However, in (1) gyroscopic forces are present only in the equations describing the changes in the corner coordi of the body. In the work, a generalization of Kelvin's theorem on the service of a pronounced matrix of gyroscopic forces was carried out. In contrast to the classical case, the area of ​​changes in the parameter of the gyrosco forces, which meets the stabilization of the system (for example, the top of the lagrange) is limited and from above, that is, the final interval of the angular velocity of the body, in which the system is conservatively stable. Using a numerical account, you can get the area of ​​stability in the parameters space χ, δ, H. The work was performed with the support of the RFFIF, project 06-01-00368. L and T R and T R A 1.
