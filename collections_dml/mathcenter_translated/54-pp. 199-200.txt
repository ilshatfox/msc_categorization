Conformal display of half -plate on the circular polygon I.A. Kolesnikov1 1 IA.KOlesnikov@mail.ru; National Research Tomsk State University in the work received an integro-reduced equation to display complex half-plane on a circular polygon. With the help of this equation and differential equation of the Schwartz, a representation is written for the Acersor parameters of MK. Key words: conformal display, accessor parameters, circular polygon. Let ∆-a circular n-angle with peaks at points a1, a2, ..., an, α1π, α22π, ..., αnπ-angles at these vertices. Let the side of the A1 An circular nang ∆ lies on the material axis. Curve l = {ζ: ζ = ζ (τ), τ ∈ [t1, tn]} = ∂∆ \ (a1, an) - a piece of iron, ζ (tk) = ak, curvature of curve l is constant at τ ∈ (tk , tk+1), t = 1, ..., n -1. The tangent to the curve l at the point ζ (τ) forms an angle θ (τ) with a material axis. We denote through f, f: π+ → ∆-holomorphic and single-leaf display of the upper half-fluidity π+ on a circular n-angle ∆. The prototypes of the vertices A1, A2, ..., AN, when displayed, are denoted through A1, A2, ..., AN, the prototype of the point ζ (τ) ∈ Line through ω (τ), ω (tk) = ak. Theorem. Display F satisfies the equation ln f ′ (z) = n∑ k = 1 γk ln (z q) - 1 π n - 1∑ k = 1 tk+1ˆ tk ln (ω (τ) - z) dison (τ) + C, (1) where C is the constant, γk = αk −1. Formula (1) is obtained using the integral formula of the Koshi. Note that in the case when all sides of the circular N-angle are rectilinear segments, i.e. θ (τ) = 0, τ ∈ (T1, TN), formula (1) will take the form of the Christophle-Shvartz formula. A special case of formula (1), when a circular N-angle is a plane with a section on a smooth curve consisting of two arcs of circles, was obtained in [1] (see also [2]). It is known that the display f satisfies the differential equation 200 materials of the Schwartz International Schwartz School Conference F ′ ′ ′ ′ (Z) F ′ (Z)-1 2 (F ′ ′ (Z) F ′ (Z)) 2 = N∑ K = 1 1 1–α2 k 2 (z –ak) 2 - mk z –ak. (2) finding the derivative of the Schwarz of the display F from the equation (1) and comparing it with the right side of the equation (2), we get the following representation for the parameters mk: mk = - n∑ j = 1, j ̸ = k γkγ j ak q + j + 1 π lim z → ak (z q)   n∑ k = 1 γk z —Ak n - 1∑ k = 1 tk+1ˆ tk 1 ω (τ) - z dθ (τ) - 1 2π  n - 1∑ k = 1 tk+1ˆ tk 1 ω (τ) - z dθ (τ)   2+n - 1∑ k = 1 tk+1ˆ tk 1 (ω (τ) - z) 2 Dθ (τ)  . This work was carried out with the support of a program to increase international competitiveness of Tomsk State University for 20132020. Literature 1. Kufarev P.P.
