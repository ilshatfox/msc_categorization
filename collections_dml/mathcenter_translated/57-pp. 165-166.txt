. Multiple Regular Sets in Spaces of Entire Functions of Finite Order M.V. Kabanko The Concepts of Weakly Regular Multiple Sets in the Spaces of Entire Functins of Finite Order Are Consedered. It is Prved that SUCH SESH ARE Interporation sets. Keywords: Entire Function, Regular Set, Interpolation Problem. UDC 517.986 On the action of limited operators in some spaces with extreme weights M.V. Kabanko1, E.L. SoftChenkova2 1 kabankom@gmail.com; Kursk State University 2 Lena.4755@mail.ru; Kursk State University earlier, professor Ovchinnikov V.I., was expressed a hypothesis about the connection of the “number” of interpolation spaces with the structure of the algebra of operators in a pair (families) of spaces. More precisely, the more spaces operators act and the more conditions are superimposed on the action of operators, the simpler the structure of the algebra of the operators. This, in fact, is the reason for the difference between the spaces -built by different metrodes of the Internet field in families of more than two spaces from the case of a pair of spaces. The example built in the work, to some extent, confirms this hypothesis. Keywords: operator algebras, family of hyilbert spaces, representation of operator algebra. Consider Gilbertov a pair {l2 (ω), l2 (ω - 1)}, where ω = (ω j) φj = 1, ω j = 2–2 j. Known that the amount of spaces l2 (ω) + l2 (ω - 1) = l2 (min {ω, ω - 1}), then l2 (ω) + l2 (ω - 1) = l2 (2 −2 j) . Similarly, l2 (ω) ∩ l2 (ω - 1) = l2 (max {ω, ω - 1}) = l2 (22 j). As you know, any weight space L2 (ω) = {ronic j} φj = 1 | {ω junk j} φj = 1 ∈ L2} isometrically the space L2, and isometry is installed using the multiplier Mω: {ă j} φ j. = 1 → {ω junk j} mitj = 1. As a result, under the action of the operator t in the pair {l2 (ω), l2 (ω - 1)} the elements of its matrix will satisfy the conditions | ai j | ≤ ∥a∥b (h) 2- | i - j | Next, consider another Gilbertov pair {l2 (u), l2 (v)}, where the weights are distributed as follows: u2n - 1 = 22 2n -1, u2n = 22 2n, u2n+1 = 2–2 2n+1, u2n+ 2 = 2–2 2n+2 and 166 Materials of the School-Conference V2N-1 = 2–2 2N-1, V2N = 2–2 2N, V2N+1 = 22 2N+1, V2N+2 = 22 2N+2. Let the operator T now act not only in the four spaces discussed above, but also in the space (not closed) n = {ronic j} φj = 1 ∈ L2 (22 J) | Φ∑ j = 1 ₽ j = 0}. Theorem. The operator t will introduce in the form of the sum of the scalar operator and operator B, displaying the sum of the spaces to the intersection. Literature 1. Davidson K. Nest Algebras.

Action of Bounded Operators in Some Spaces with Rarefied Weights M.V. Kabanko, E.L. Myagchenkova Prof. V.I. Ovchinnikov Suggested the Hypothesis on Connection of the “Number” of Interporation Spaces with the Structure of the Algebra of Operators in a Couple (Family) of Spaces. MORE PRECISILY, In MORE Spaces theRE ARE Operators and the MORE CONDITIONS ARE IMPOSED on the Action of Operators, The Simpler Is the Algebra of Oferators. That is, in fact, the reason for the difference in the Spaces Constructed by Different Interpolation Methods in Families of More Two Spaces of a Pair of Spaces. The Example, Constructed in the Paper, Confirms This Hypothesis to Some Extend. Keywords: Operator Algebras, Families of Hilbert Spaces, Representation of Operator Algebras.
