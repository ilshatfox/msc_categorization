Numerical modeling of laser radiation with a round micro -zone with an non -center active zone A.O. Oktyabrskaya1 1 alina.oktyabrskaya.21@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, the Institute of Computing Mathematics and Information Technologies proposes methodological modeling of laser radiation with active micro -zone with holes. The corresponding nonlinear spectral task for the system of boundary integral equations is solved by the Galerkin method with a trigonometric basis. The results of numerical experiments are given, and the method of the effectiveness of the method. Keywords: Galerkin method, spectral task for the system of boundary integral equations, laser radiation lasers based on micro -Rusonators are widely used in a photonic. One of the approaches to the study of their characteristics is based on solving the so -called laser problem to its own values ​​[1]. In [1], the problem was solved numerically by the method of quadrators. If the shape of the resonators and holes is round, then the Galerkin method may be preferable, since in this case the matrix elements are written in explicitly [2]. In this work, we develop ideas formulated in [2], and give the results of numerical experiments confirming the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Consider a round resonator with an non -center round hole (Fig. 1). Its shape consists of two regions of piPi andω2. These areas are limited by non -center circles γ1 and γ2 with radii A1 and A2, respectively. We denote the external region. We introduce local coordinate systems for areas ω1 and ω2, as shown in the figure. Rice. 1. The geometry of a round resonator Let the function U describes the amplitude of the resonator's own fashion (see [1]). We will look for such numbers k> 0 and γ> 0, in which the non -earlier function U 140 “Lobachevsky Readings - 2019” is a solution to the Helmholtz equation ∆U +k2mu = 0, x &M, m = 1.2.3, (1) Satisfies the conjugation conditions U - = u+, ηm ∂u - ∂rm = ηm+1 ∂u+∂rm, x ∈ γm, m = 1.2, (2) as well as the condition of radmerfeld radiation at infinity. B (1), (2) km = kνm, m = 1, 2, 3. For h-polyarization u = hz, ηm = ν-2m, for polarization u = ez and ηm = 1. symbol Rm B (2 ) We denote a single normal to the border γm, directed outside the region ωm. We will search for solutions to the problem (1), (2) in the class of integrated functions that are continuously differentiated in closed areas ωm and twice continuously differentiated in ωm, m = 1, 2, 3. We use the integral representations of the function u: u (x) = - - ∫ γ1 u - (y) ∂g1 (x, y) ∂r1 (y) dl (y)+ ∫ γ1 g1 (x, y) ∂u - (y) ∂r1 (y) dl (y), x ∈ Ω1, (3) u (x) = ∫ γ1 u+(y) ∂g2 (x, y) ∂r1 (y) dl (y) - ∫ γ1 g2 (x, y) ∂u+(y) ∂r1 (y) (y) (y) (y) (y) ∂r1 (y) ) dl (y) - ∫ γ2 u - (y) ∂g2 (x, y) ∂r2 (y) dl (y)+ ∫ γ2 g2 (x, y) ∂u - (y) ∂r2 (y) dl (y), x ∈ω2, (4) u (x) = ∫ γ2 u+(y) ∂g3 (x, y) ∂r2 (y) dl (y) - ∫ γ2 g3 (x, y) ∂u+( y) ∂r2 (y) dl (y), x ∈ω3. (5) here GM (x, y) = i /4 h (1) 0 (km | x - y |) - the foundational solution of the Gelm Golts equation. Following [1], [2], we will reduce the initial task (1), (2) to the nonlinear task for our own values ​​for the system of boundary integral equations of Muller. For example, the second equation of the system has the following type [2]: u1 (x)+ ∫ γ1 u1 (y) k 1.1 (x, y)+ v1 (y) k 1.2 (x, y) dl (y) + ∫ γ2 u2 (y) k 1.3 (x, y)+ v2 (y) k 1.4 (x, y) dl (y) = 0, where x ∈ γ1. Own functions have the form um (x) = u+ (x) = u - (x), vm = ηm+ 1+ ηm 2ηm ∂u+ (x) ∂rm (x) = ηm+ 1+ ηm 2 op - 1 ∂u- (x) ∂RM (x), xm ∈ γM. A.O. Oktyabrskaya 141 where M = 1.2. The nuclei in the system of integral equations of the muller have the form K 1.1 (X, Y) = ∂ (G1 (X, Y) −G2 (X, Y) ∂R1 (Y), K 1.2 (X, Y) = 2η1g2 (x, y) −2η2g1 (x, y) η2 +η1, k 1.3 (x, y) = ∂g2 (x, y) ∂r2 (y), k 1.4 (x, y) = −2η3g2 (x, y) η3 +η2. We solve the system of integrated equations in numerically, using the Galerkin method with a trigonometric basis. Present our own functions in the form: u (n) m (t) = 1 am n∑ k = −n onic (m) k ei kt, v (n) m (t) = 1 am n∑ k = −n ψ ( m) k ei kt, m = 1.2, t ∈ [0.2π] following [2], [3], we calculate the matrix elements analytical elements. Then the non -linear algebraic task for its own values ​​will take the following type:   a11 A12 A13 A14 A22 A23 A24 A32 A33 A33 A34 A42 A43         W (2) ψ (2) ψ ( 1) ψ (2)   = 0. Here AI J is a block matrix with elements A (I, J) K, L, I, J = 1 ,. . . , 4, k, l = −n ,. . . , N, which are non -linearly dependent on their own numbers k and γ; Own vector has the form onic (i) = (pul (i) −n,., onic (i) n), ψ (i) = (ψ (i) −n,., ψ (i) n ).
