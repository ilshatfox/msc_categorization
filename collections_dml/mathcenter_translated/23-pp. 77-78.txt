Through F (X1,., XM) we will indicate the sum of a row (1) at those points where it converges. Further, we denote ∆1 (f, x, h) = ∆1 (f, x1,., XM, H1,., HM) mixed difference of function F at point X with step h. Determination 1. Let the function f (x) ∈ LP (tm), p ∈ (1, urb). The mixed continuity module will call ωp (f, Δ1,., Δm) = sup | h1 | ≤δ1, ..., | hm | ≤δm || ∆1 (f, x, h) || p. Determination 2. If ω1 (Δ1) are set ,. . . , ωm (δm) - continuity modules - and 1 ≤ p ≤ φ, then through hω1 ... ωmp, we denote the many functions f (t): f (t) ∈ LP (tm), ωp (f, δ1,.. ., δm) = o (∏m j = 1 ωj (δj)).

Then, in order for f (x) ∈ Hω1 ... ωmp, it is necessary and enough to ensure that the condition is performed an = an1, ..., nm = o  ω ω1 (1 n1) N 1 - 1 p 1 ·. . . · · Ωm (1 nm) N 1 - 1 p m  , where x = (x1,., XM), n = (N1,., NM), nx = n1x1 +. . . + NMXM, respectively. The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (project No. 0301-00080) and the program for supporting leading scientific schools (project NSh1657.2003.1). V.V. Aseev (Novosibirsk, btp@math.nsc.ru) O. A. Lazarev (Novosibirsk) about the continuity of the above module and transfinite diameter under the capacitor in RN, we mean a pair (E0, E1) of non -non -overstraining compact sets. We use the following designations: Mod (E0, E1) - the conformal capacitor module (E0, E1); DIST (A, B) - Khausdorfovo distance between compact sets, built on the basis of chord metric σ (x, y) in RN; DIAM (A) - the diameter of the set A ⊂ rn in the chord metric; D (a, b) = Inf {σ (x, y): x ∈ A, y ∈ B - the distance between the sets. Following the swing, we call the non -path -point compact set T ⊂ rn evenly perfect (uniformly perfect), if there is α> 0, such that there is no capacitor (E0, E1) with coherent plates and conformal module MOD (E0, E1) α α α for which t ⊂ e0∪e1, t ∩e0 6 = ∅ 6 = t ∩e1. Using the technique of relatively monotonous functions developed in the work [1] and [2], we get the following property of the uniform continuity of the conformal module: for any pair of α-annexily perfect compacts E, F ⊂ Rn and any compact k ⊂ rn non-equal capacity, such what min {d (k, e ∪ f), diam (e), diam (f)}> d; DIST (E, F) <PA; d> (2 + 4eα) δ, 80
