Algebra Leibniu is determined.rrer will identify. 1 x (yz) = (xy) z - (xz) y (see [1, 2)). Let V - the diversity generated by the algebra Lebinitsa L, where L is the explosion k [t] at: .. .. niggs the dicarpa algebra Leibniz G2 with b -zis /1, e and the multiplication table hf1 = it = eh = o, he = h. We will consider it -prisoned by the S.Riedushchis of actions: f (t) h = tf (t), f (t) e tf '(t), hf (t) = ef (t) = about. In addition, F1 (t) f2 (t) = about. Theorem 1. Basis, and. Identously m: N.
