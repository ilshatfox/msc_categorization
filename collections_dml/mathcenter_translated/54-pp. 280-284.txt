Gagarina, Engels Technological Institute (branch) showed that there is a matrix of interpolation units, as you like, close to the matrix of equivalent nodes t = {xk, n = 2πk/(2n +1): −n ≤ k ≤ n, n = 1.2 ,. . . }, such that after correction (with continuity) of the function F ∈C2π on a set of low measure (0.2.3) - the internet process with knots with knots will converge to the corrected function evenly on [−π, π]. Keywords: lacunar interpolation, rows of Fourier, correction of functions. Denote through ln (t, f, x), n = 1.2 ,. . . , trigonometric interpolation of Polin Lagrange Functions F ∈C2π with nodes {xk, n = 2πk/(2n +1)} nk = −n, and through QN (t, f, x), n = 1.2 ,. . . , (0.2.3) —The internal -sexing Polin Birkhof is such that QN (t, f, xk, n) = f (xk, n), q ′ n (t, f, xk, n) = q ′ ′ ′ N (t, f, xk, n) = 0, k = −n, n. It is well known [1] that the interpolation process {ln (t, f, x)} و = 1 for f ∈C2π can diverge with all x ̸≡ 0 (mod 2π), like a number of fourier of the summarized function. At the same time, it is known (see, e.g. [2]) that any measurable (final p.) Function can be corrected by many arbitrarily small measures so that its Fourier series will become evenly converging (enhanced C-ponds , according to the terminology of N.K. Bari). The question arises, does the class of continuous functions have a similar property in relation to a particular interpolation process? This note shows that there is a matrix of inter -polishing nodes Mγ, as close to the matrix of the equivalent nodes t = {xk, n = 2πk/(2n + 1): −n ≤ k ≤ n, n = 1.2 ,. . . }, such that after correction (with continuity) of the function F ∈ C2π on a set of low measure (0.2.3) - the interpolation process with the Mex nodes will converge to the corrected function G evenly on [−π, π]. Theorem. Let the sequence γ = {γn} و = 1 ⊂ r+ such that γn → 0 for n → urb. Then there is a matrix of inter -polishing nodes mγ = {yk, n} n, gerk = −n, n = 1 with the following properties: 1) | xk, n - yk, n | <γn, −n ≤ k ≤ n, n purpose; 2) for any f ∈ C2π, and 0 <Δ <2π, the function g ∈ C2π and the set of E ⊂ [−π, π], mese> 2π - broad are found that F = G on E and Lim N → ∣∣ ∣∣ QN (mγ, g, ·) - g ∣∣c2π = 0. For further presentation, we will need some designations and we. Let f ∈ C2π, n ≥ 3, and m: −π <y - n, n <y - n+1, n <. . . <yn, n <π - V.V. Novikov 281 arbitrary matrix of inter -polishing nodes. Put ∆I, n = (y2i - 1, n, y2i+1, n), ∆2 fi = f (y2i+1, n) −2 f (y2i, n)+f (y2i - 1, n), | ∆I, N | = y2i+1, n - y2i - 1, n, d1 (m, n) = min i | ∆i, n |, d2 (m, n) = max i | ∆i, n |, and let rn, p (M, f) = ∣∣∣∣∣ [n/2] −1∑ ′ i = - [n/2] +1 ∆2 fi ∗ (2i +1, n, p) ∣∣∣∣∣, rn (M, f) = max - n - 1≤p≤n rn, p (m, f), where С (m, n, p) =  p −m, if ∣∣p —M∣ ∣≤ 3 ([n/2] +1), 2n - (p −m), if p −m> 3 ([n/2] +1), −2n - (p −m) if p −m <−3 ([n/2] +1). Here, the bar at the sign of the amount indicates the absence (no more than two) terms, in which the index I is a solution to the equation ffic (2k + 1, n, p) = 0; In addition, we believe that yn+1, n = π, y - n - 1, n = −π. For an arbitrary final set A = {A1; A2; . . . ; am} ⊂ r through d (a): = min i, j {| ai - a j | : ai ̸ = a j} We will denote the smaller positive distance between its points. In addition, as usual, through C, absolute, generally speaking of various, constant. Lemma 1. There is a sequence γ = {γn} ⊂ r+ such that for any f ∈C2π and any matrix of nodels = {yi, n}, for which | yi, n −xi, n | <γn, i = −n ,. . . , n; N ≥ 3, (1) equality of lim n → gern (mγ, f) = 0 will be a necessary and sufficient condition for uniform convergence to F on [−π, π] of the interpolation process {ln (mγ, f, x)}. The approval of Lemma 1 is an analogue of the criterion of convergence from [3]. It can be obtained using the representation for the difference F (x) −Ln (t, f, x) from the indicated work, as well as the fact of the continuous dependence of fundamental polynomials of interpolation on nodes and x ∈ [--π, π]. We also give the next lemma of a technical nature without evidence. Lemma 2. Let γ = {γn} - a sequence of lemma 1 and mγ = {yi, n} - any fixed matrix of nodes that satisfies the condition (1). Let, further, σ> 0 - an arbitrary fairly small number and final set of points λ = {λi} m+1i = 0 such that λ0: = −π <λ1 <· · <λm+1: = π, D (λ)> σ. Then there is a number N0 = N0 (σ), depending only on σ, such that with n> n0 evenly by p = −n −1,. . . N will be faithful to the inequalities qp, n (λ): = ∑ i | onic (2i +1, n, p) | −1 ≤ 5, (2) where the summation goes on I, for which ∗ (2i +1, n, p) ̸ = 0 and ∆i, n ∩λ ̸ = ∅. Lemma 3. There is a sequence γ = {γn} ⊂ r+, for which the statement of lemma 1 and, in addition, the region
