Materials of the International School-Conference UDC 517.5 Step-scale scaling function on the local fields of a positive characteristic and the algorithm for its construction Yu.S. Cruiss1 1 krussus@gmail.com; SSU named after N.G. Chernyshevsky in the work provides an algorithm for constructing a step scaling function with a compact media on the local fields of a positive characteristic. Keywords: a multiple analysis, a scaling function, a local field of a positive characteristic. The local field F (s) of the positive characteristic P is isomorphic to the space of the sequences infinite in both sides of the sequences, where only the final number of members with negative numbers are unnecessary: ​​(., 0i - 1, XI, XI+1, XI.), XI. ∈ GF (p s), gf (p s) - the final field [1]. The zero element of the GF field (p s) has the form 0 = (00.01,.., 0S - 1). The surroundings of the zero element of the field f (s) - 0 = (., 0.0.0,.), Are the sets f (s) n (f (s) n ⊂ f (s) n - 1): F (s) n = {a = (.., 0, an, an, an+1,..): A j ∈Gf (p s)}, n ∈Z. In 2004, in the work of H. Jiang, D. Li, N. Jin [2] there was a definition of the KMA on the LABLE fields of a positive characteristic. Determination 1. [2] Let f (s) Local field of the positive characteristics of ki. The set of closed subspaces {vn} n∈Z ∈ L2 (F (S)) is called KMA in L2 (F (S)) if the following axioms are performed: A1) vn ⊂vn+1; A2) ⋃ n] vn = l2 (f (s)); A3) ⋂ n∈Z vn = {0}; A4) f (x) ∈Vn ⇔ f (a x) ∈Vn+1, a - stretching operator; A5) There is a function of pul ∈V0 such that the system of shifts {onic (x - ̇h)} hgr0 forms an orthonormated basis in V0, where H0 is a lot of shifts. Function ffic from axiom A5 is called a scalable function for a given KMA. Let the music scaling function, then from the axiom A1 it follows that ∗ (x) = ∑ hgr0 ch ventral (a x - ̇h), ∑ hgr0 | ch | 2 <+urb, (1) where ch ∈C. Equation (1) is called a scalable equation. Theorem 1. [2] Let f (s) - the local field of the positive characteristic p, p is a simple number. If the system of closed subspaces {v j} jorn in l2 (f (s)) satisfies the axioms of A1-A5 kMA and exist integral-periodic functions M (l), l ∈ GF (p s), l ̸ = 0, such that Matrix M (χ) = [m (l) (χRA00)] (l, a0 ∈ GF (p s), r0 - the function of Rademacher) is unitary, then there is an orthonomated basis of the veseums ψ (l) (a n x - ̇h), l ∈ Gf (p s), l ̸ = 0, h ∈ H0, in l2 (f (s)), where ̂̂ (l) (χ) = m (l) (χ) ng (χa −1), l ∈Gf ( p s), l ̸ = 0, m (0) - a mask of a scaling equation. Yu.S. Cruiss 213 V [2] is assumed that iment is known to us. It is worth noting that the search for a suitable function wor is a separate task. In 2012, B. Behera and Q. Jahan [3] published the necessary and sufficient conditions so that the function is ∈ L2 (F (S)) generates KMA. Theorem 2. [3] We denote throughu = {Ra11. . .r aν ν, a j ∈ GF (p s), ν ∈ N0}, r J - Rademacher functions. The function mon l2 (f (s)) satisfies the axiom a5 kma when and only when for any χ ∈ F (s) ⊥1∑ mic |u | onic (χ) | 2 = 1, lim J → ger | (χa - j) | = 1, for P.V.χ ∈ X and there is an integral-periodic function M (0) (χ) ∈ L2 (F (S) ⊥1) such that for P.V. χ ∈ X is true equality ∗ (χ) = m (0) (χ) ∗ (χa −1). In 2014, S.F. Lukomsky and A.M. Divers [1, 4] proposed another approach to the local fields of a positive characteristic. They consider the local field F (S) the positive characteristics of P as a linear space above the GF (P S) final field. In this case, the product of the element a ∈ F (S) on the elementage ∈Gf (p s) element is determined by the passing. In [4], the connection between the local fields F (S) the positive characteristic and the groups of Vilenkin G. with s = 1 additive group F (1)+ the local field f (s) the positive characteristic P is a vilenkin group with a constant forming sequence PN = P . And with S> 1 Additive group f (s)+ isomorphic to the work of Vilenkin groups [1]. We denote through DM (F (S) −N) a lot of step functions F ∈ L2 (F (S)) are such that SUPP F ⊂ F (S) −N and F is constant on many species F (S) M +̇G. For functions with a compact medium, a scaling equation (1) contains an amount with a final number of terms. ∗ (x) = ∑ hgr (n+1) 0 ch ventral (a x - ̇h), (2) where h (n) 0 = {x ∈ F (s): x = a --1g - 1+̇a −2G–2+̇. . .+̇A - n g - n, n purpose, a - j ∈Gf (p s)}. Equation (2) can be written in the form −1, h) - Mask equation (2). In [1], an algorithm for constructing a scalable function from the class DM (F (S) −1) was proposed, with an additional restriction: the absolute values ​​of converting the fourier of the scaling function are 0 or 1. In 2016 in [5] this algorithm was generalized for functions From the class DM (F (S) −N), in addition, it was possible to get rid of restrictions on the absolute values ​​of the converting of Fourier, which can now take values ​​from [0.1]. We will outline the algorithm for constructing a step scalable function with a compact media on the local fields of a positive characteristic. 214 Materials of the International School-Conference Step 1.
