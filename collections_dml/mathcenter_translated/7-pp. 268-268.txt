Hydrofilles with specified cavitation diagrams of F.G. Avhadiev, D.V. Maklakov Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics named after NG Chebotarev Kazan State University 420008, Kazan, ul. University, 17 farit.avhadiev@ks.ru, the report gives an overview of the results of the authors on the task of building a roperfil guide, the cavitation diagram (envelope of pressures) of which exactly coincides with the predetermined function F (A), where A is the angle of the ata ki. We consider isolated profiles streamlined by a stream of ideal inconsistent fluid. The following three groups of results were obtained. 1) Description of the many cavitation diagrams. The main trigonometric bulge of the function /(a) = ~ l+f (a) = max v (z) jv (: xj), z a (1) where the current speed with attack angle a. A 2) the analytical method for constructing a profile that has a given vitation diagram F (A). We determine in the quadrature a function that conformally display the appearance of the circle to the current area. The proves are based on the formula (1), the obvious solution to the equalization of Max LG (Y) COS (A-Y) I =/(A), U (2) the theory of trigonometric moments and the theory of reverse regional tasks. 3) accurate estimates from below for cavitation diagrams, comparison theorems for the solutions of equation (2). The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (projects No. 99-01 00173, 99-01-366, 99-01-00169). 268
