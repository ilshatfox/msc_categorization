The formula of Taylor for a discrete analytical function set on a square with the goal of this work is to establish theoreties and uniqueness of the decomposition of Taylor for a hard analytical function determined on the final square of the Gaussian plane. Let IP = {z e s: / z / <r} and qn = (z++ iz+) nin. We denote through A (IN) and V (QN) the space of analytical and discrete analytical functions defined in and R and QN, respectively. Following D. Zayberger [Z], we determine the system of pseudo -anti -springs {nk (z)} in V (QN). The next theorem is proved by the author in [1]. Theorem. Let F E D (QN). Then there is 00 (.;) K f (.;) = L ak 1 + i e (in), k = o such, 'that 00 f (z) = laknk (z) k = o and a row absolutely go. I am for all ze qp.
