Complex fluctuations in the geometrically non-linear spherical shells on the rectangular plan under the action of the alternating transverse load Krysko V.A., Sopenko A.A. “Saliy E.V. Saratov State Technical University for the initial equations, the equations of Margerra-Vlasov Mustari are adopted. They are reduced to the final differences. the system of multiple differential equations, which is solved by the method of rune compartment. Consider the square shell in plan (A. = a 1 b = 1), the editorial and physical parameters are as follows: a = b = o, 1 m. , h = s, o · I0 -4 m, E = 69 GPA, V = 0.3, P = 2800 kg/m 3. Dyight parameters k x = a 2! HR = 24. The initial conditions are zero. Granovic conditions - boundary conditions - boundary conditions - The hinged relying on flexible ribs, non -threshold in the tangent plane. The boundaries of the chaos of the chaos were determined for the above design. The following results were obtained. The critical value of the load, in which the system finds is in a state of equal. is Q = 25.7. Until time t = 32, the beating period t ::: 2.5, \ l'M. • :::: 0.811. wmin ::::: 0.881. Then the beating period increases to t :: 3, 9, and- 'ma.kh :::: 0.958, and, "min ::::: 1, 018. With an increase in the load to q = 25.8, the transition of the system is saved into a state of chaos. Until time t = 32, fluctuations are made in the vision with the period T ::: 2.5 (Fig. La), it ", :: 0.826 and WMIN :::: 0.886, that is, that is, The shell behaves approximately in the same way as for Q = 25.7 in the permissible time. The system is equal to this. This is evidenced by the phase portrait (Fig. LB) and the display of Poincare, which is an elongated set of points. Located at an angle of 45 ° to the abscissa axis (Fig. LC). According to the periodogram, the oscillations were made at frequencies indicated in Fig. LD numbers 1-6. At the same time, the main frequencies are 2 and 3. there are a small number of noise components in the vicinity of frequencies 1, 2 and 3. 117 Krysko V.A., Sopenko A .A .. Saliy E.V.
