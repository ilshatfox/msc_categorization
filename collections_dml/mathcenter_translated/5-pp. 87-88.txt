The task is A. Find the function and (x, y, z) with the emitting their own. mi: 1) u (x, y, z) e C2 (y) nc3 (h); 2) and (x, y, z) is a solution to the equation (1); 3) the function and (x, y, z) satisfies the edge conditions and (x, y, x +y) = f (x, y), o x, y < +oo, (their +yu - iz) lz = x +y = 1/j (x, y), o <x, y < +oo, u (o, y, z) = f (y, z), o s z < +oo. (2) In case of proof of the existence and unity of the solution of this problem, the solution of the Koshi problem is used for the equation (1) obtained by the author of Z-Y Z-T U (X, Y, Z) = F (Z-Y, Y)+K1 J DT J [F.
