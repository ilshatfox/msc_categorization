The construction of the Kartanovsky continuation of the algebra Lee type B3, let L = −1∑ I = −3 LI, is the inilpotent part of the classic algebra of the type B3 with a graduation in the height of the roots. The ultimate goal of this work is to build a complete Kartanovsky continuation of the algebra L above the field K characteristics P = 2, 3 using a crawling display (see [1]). With other characteristics, the continuation breaks off with algebra type B3. In these theses, we indicate only the display π0 and π1. 57 in the designations [1] we have the following. Case π0 for p 6 = 2. Let v0 = 〈vi∂j, i, j = 1, 2, 3; I 6 = j〉. Put π0 (XIMI) = 0 and π0 (XIMJ) = vi∂j for i, j = 1, 2, 3; I 6 = j. With p = 2 we have v0 = 〈vi∂j, i, j = 1, 2, 3; I 6 = j; (i, j) 6 = (1, 3)〉, π0 (XIMI) = 0 for I = 1, 2, 3 and π0 (x1ă peace) = 0, π0 (XIMIT) = VI∂J, I, J = 1 , 2, 3; I 6 = 6 = j, (i, j) 6 = (1, 3). Case π1. V1 - subspace in 〈vivj∂k〉 (C - appropriate composition). C = (−1, 0, 2): π1 (x23 edge) = 0 with p = 3; C = (−1, 1, 1): π1 (x2x3ă) = −2v2v3∂1, π1 (x3x2ă) = v2v3∂1; C = (−1, 2, 0): π1 (x222) = 0; C = (0, −1, 2): π1 (x23 edge) = 0; C = (0, 0, 1): π1 (x1x3ă) = v1v3∂1, π1 (x2x3 edge) = v2v3∂2, π1 (x3x1 edge) = −v1v3∂1, π1 (x3x2 edge) = −3v2v2v3∂2, π1 (x23 edge) = −3V2V3∂2; C = (0, 1, 0): π1 (x1x2ă) = v1v2∂1, π1 (x2x1 8) = −v1v2∂1 + v22∂2 + v2v3∂3, π1 (x 2 12) = v 2 2∂2 , π1 (x2x3 edge) = v1v2∂1 +v 2 2∂2 --v2v3∂3, π1 (x3x2ă) = = v2v3∂3; C = (1, 0, 0): π1 (x 2 1ă) = v1v2∂1, π1 (x1x2ă) = 2v1v2∂1, π1 (x1x3 edge) = v1v2∂1, π1 (x2x1ă peace) = iv1v2∂1, π1 (x3x1 edge) = −v1v2∂1; C = (2, −1, 0): π1 (x21 edge) = 0.
