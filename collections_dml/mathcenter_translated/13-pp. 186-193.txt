. . . The choice of a partial-unavated scheme for the non-stationary equation of convection-disjuisation with the dominant process1 O.A. Lapshina Rostov State University, Rostov-on-Don in the work considers the non-stationary equation of convection of disfusion in the incompetent environment ∂u ∂t-1 pE ∆U + 1 2 (v1 ∂u ∂x + v2 ∂u ∂y + ∂x (v1u (v1u (v1u (v1u (v1u ) + ∂ ∂y (v2u)) = f, (1) div ~ v = 0, (x, y) ∈ ω = [0, 1] × [0, 1], f = f (x, y, t ), ~ v = {v1, v2}, with the initial U (x, y, 0) = u0 (x, y) (2) and boundary conditions u (x, y, t) | ∂ω = 0. (3 ) The first term in equation (1) corresponds to the dynamics of the task, the second term - diffusion transfer, and the rest - convective. It should be noted that the condition of inconsistency allowed us to record the original equation in the so -called “symmetric form”. When solving the problem of convection-dipping, it is important to know which of the processes prevails: convective or diffusion. To evaluate this, the number of Peckla, which appears during the removal of the equation. With PE ¿1, we have a process with the dominance of diffusion, and with PE à 1 convection dominates. During the approximation of the problem (1) - (3), the endless method with the central differences for the first derivatives was used, which has the second order of approximation in space [1, 2]. Note that the recording of the convection-disengage equation 1 work was performed with financial support for the RFFI, project N 00-01 00011 186 O.A. Lapshina in symmetrical form with central-strife approximation allows us to maintain the basic properties of the differential operator of convection of this equation and guarantees the receipt of a dissipative matrix [4]. After the approximation of the spatial derivatives equations (1) - (3) on the standard five -point template we get: BH un +1 - un τ +ahun = fn. (4) Here BH, AH - linear operators in the endless calbert space having the form BH = E + σ1τDH + σ2τC0H, AH = C0H + DH. (5) As you know [3], the scheme, stable according to the initial data (fn = 0), is stable on the right side. Therefore, we examine stability according to the initial data. The most general assessment of stability was obtained by information (4), (5) to a three-layer operator-growth scheme with self-consolidated operators and the study of the latter based on the known results about the stability of three-layer circuits [1, 2]. In relation to the task (4), (5) in [6] the following most general result was obtained. Theorem 1 [6]. If the condition is 2DH - τ (2σ2 - 1) C20H + τ (2σ1 - 1) d2h + + τ (σ1 + σ2 - 1) (DHC0H - C0HDH) ≥ 0, (6) Scheme (3), (4) stable According to initial data. In a particular case, when σ1 = 0, σ2 = 1, we get a partially navigable scheme in which the convection operator is taken from the upper temporary layer, i.e., on each layer we solve the problem (e + τc0h) un + 1 = τfn + (E - τDH) un. (7) Statement of stability for this case can be carried out by energy inequalities. We formulate this condition. 187 Choosing a partial-unexpected scheme for a non-stationary equation. . . Theorem 2. Let the condition τ 2 dh ≤ e, (8) then a homogeneous (fn = 0) scheme (4), (5) (σ1 = 0, σ2 = 1) is stable. Proof. Scablarbly multiply (7) by un+1, taking into account that fn = 0: ‖un+1‖2+τ (c0hun+1, un+1) = ((e - τDH) un, un+1), we will use the roe densimetricity operator C0H and condition (AX, Y) ≤ ‖A‖ ‖X‖ ‖Y‖, we get ‖UN+1‖2 ≤ ‖E - τDH‖ ‖UN‖ ‖UN+1‖, ‖UN+1‖ ≤ ‖E - τd‖ ‖un‖. So, for the stability of the circuit, you need to fulfill the condition ‖e - τdh‖ ≤ 1. Given the self -strengthening of the operator DH, it is equivalent to the following: ≤E ≤ E - τDH ≤ E, 0 ≤ τDH ≤ 2E. This follows the desired assessment (8) stability for the scheme (4), (5). The theorem has been proven. I must say that the assessment (6) is more common for the task (4), (5) and boils down to (8), if put in (6) σ1 = 0, σ2 = 1. Indeed, 2DH - τC20H - τD2H ≥ 0 , (2DH - τD2H) ≥ τC20H, dH (2E - τDH) ≥ τC20H. Using the KROSOMITRICTION OF Operator C0H, it can be proved that C20H <0. We will use this: DH (2E - τDH) ≥ 0; 188 O.A. Lapshina given the positive certainty of the DH operator, we have (2E - τDH) ≥ 0. And this is the assessment (8). However, for receiving (6), more bulky calculations were needed, while the conclusion of the condition (8) for our particular case demanded much less effort. In the case when convective terms are taken from the previous temporary layer, i.e. σ1 = 1, σ2 = 0, we get another partial-unhanged scheme, in which only a symmetrical diffusion operator is made upstairs. The condition of stability for this case takes the following form. Theorem 3 [2]. For the scheme (4), (5) (σ1 = 1, σ2 = 0), the assessment is correct ‖un + 1‖d ≤ (1 + m2 4 τ) · ‖un‖d, where m2 is a value that depends on the speed vector and its first derivatives. To show the effectiveness of the use of partial-unavated schemes for the non-stationary equation of convection-diplower, the results were compared with the results of the use of a classic implicit scheme. Four tasks were tested, the coefficients of the speed vectors of which are given in table 1. All of them are determined in the
