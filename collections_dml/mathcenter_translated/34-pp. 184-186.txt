One integro-operator equation of D. E. Saifullin Kazan State University, baxic81@mail.ru is considered the integro-operational equation Aaper ≡ γ ∫ t 0 ϕ (τ) dτ + t (ivil) = f (t), 0 6 T 6 1, (1) where γ is the desired parameter, ∗ (t) - the desired function, f (t) - a given continuous function, t - a given linear (including integral) operator, and ship (γ, ∗)-the desired vector-function. The task of solving the equation (1) in known functional spaces is not incorrect [1, 2]. Below, this task is set correctly by the spaces of the desired elements and right parts suitable under the boron. Let C = {lus}-the space of the vector-function ffic ng = (γ, ∗), where γ ∈ R, onic ∈ C, with the norm ‖ices ϕ | γ | + ‖Ices (γ ∈ R, onic ∈ C), and c1 = c1 [0, 1]-the space of all continuous-disenced on [0, 1] functions with the norm ‖f‖c1 = | f (0) | + Max 06t61 | F ′ (t) |, f ∈ C1. Theorem 1. Let T: C → C1 - a completely continuous operator, and a homogeneous equation Aular = 0, onic ∈ C, corresponding to the equation (1), has in space C only trivial solution lus ll = 0 ⇔ ϕ 0, γ = 0. Then the operator A: C → C1 is continuously reversible, therefore, the equation (1) has the only solution onic ∗ = (γ ∗, ∗ ∗) ∈ C, where γ ∗ ∈ R, ∗ ∗ ∈ C, with any right part F ∈ C1. Theorem 2. Let q ≡ ‖t‖c → c1 <1. Then the equation (1) has the only solution onic ∗ = (γ ∗, onic ∗) ∈ C, where γ ∗ ∈ R, ∗ ∗ ∈ C, with any right Parts F ∈ C1, moreover, ‖ices ∗ ‖c = | γ ∗ | + ‖ Vents ∗ ‖c 6 ‖f‖c1 (1 - q) −1. Consequence. In the conditions of theorem 1, the operator A: C → C 1 has a continuous linear reverse and ‖A -1‖ 6 (1 - Q) −1, A -1: C1 → C. Theorem 3. In the conditions of theorem 2, the only solution is ll ∗ = = (γ ∗, ∗ ∗) ∈ C equations (1) can be found by iteration method γi + ∫ t 0 onic (τ) dτ = f (t) - t (∗ - 1; t), i = 1, 2,. . . (2) at any initial approximation ∗0 = (γ0, wor, Formula onic ffic = g-11f = (f (0), f ′ (t)), then the error of the i-h pulle ∗-∗-can be assessed by the inequality ‖ç ∗ ∗ ϕ ventration ≡ | γ ∗ ∗ γ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ∗ ∗ (t) −wor (t) ‖c 6 qi+1‖f‖c1 1 - q, i = 1, 2 ,. . . 187 L and T R A T R A 1.

Sayfutdinov Kazan State University, iLnursoft@mail.ru considers the task of emissing from a semi -infinite cylindrical waveguide to a lesser wave of a smaller radius, the symmetry axis of which is biased relative to the axis of the first volume of the New District. Cylindrical waves with perfectly conductive walls are filled with a homogeneous isotropic medium. The properties of the media in the waves are generally different. Let the water with a larger diameter run into the junction of its own wave TM0.1. It is necessary to find an electromagnetic field in each of the dudes of a wave -breed structure. It is supposed to be performed by a hypot in classical electrodynamics for electromagnetic in lei and the independence of the field from the angle α. Due to the fact that the field does not depend on the angle α, we will consider the process in the plane of the style (r, z). The components of the falling electromagnetic wave are from the messenger, and the parameters of the scattered field can be expressed through EZ = U, where this fusion satisfies the wave equity 1 R ∂R (r · ∂U ∂R) + 1 R2 ∂2U ∂α2 + (K2 + γ2 + γ2 + γ2 + ) u = 0 (1) 188
