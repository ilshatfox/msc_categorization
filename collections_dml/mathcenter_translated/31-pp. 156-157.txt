. Orifunctional border of the strictly convex plane of Minkovsky V.V. Tyukhtin Pomeranian State University named after MV Lomonosov, G. Arkhangelsk 156 under the space of Minkovsky, we mean a final normalized space. In [1], compacting XH is determined for an arbitrary local compact metric space (x, ρ). M. Riffel [2] calls such a compacting metric, and in [3] it is called orifunctional. The points of the orifunctional border are the so -called orifunctions, that is, the limits of distance functions of the type DX (y) = ρ (x, y) - ρ (o, x), where o ∈ X is the marked point. In addition to the orifunctional for the spaces of incompatible curvature in the sense of Buzeman, the so -called geodetic compacting XG is determined. The geodetic boundary ∂gx = xg \ x is formed by the classes of asymptotic geodetic rays. Theorem. Let V 2 - the plane of Minkovsky with a strictly convex norm. Then there is such a homeomorphism ffic: ∂hv 2 → S1 Orifunctional boundaries of space V 2 on the Euclidean sphere that the next diagram s1 ° - → ∂hv 2 µ–1 ↓ ↓ PR S PR - ∂GV 2 is switching. Here µ: s → S1 - Gaussian spherical image of the Indicature of the norm S, Pinger: s → ∂gv 2 - central projection, and PR: ∂HV 2 ∂GV 2 - display that compares each orifunction its direction of the anti -gradient. With N> 2, the statement similar to our theorem is unfair. 157
