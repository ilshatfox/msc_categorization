) The theorems of the coating and distortion for algebraic polynomas methods of the geometric theory of the functions of the complex alternating are applied to inequalities for algebraic polynomas. Developing the ideas of work [1], we prove new inequalities, including, generally, a free member, senior coefficient and extreme values ​​of either a module or a real part of a polynome on a circle or on a segment. As an example, we give the following result. Theorem. Let p (z) - Polin degree N with material coefficients, normalized by conditions: max {p (z): z ∈ [−1, 1]} = −Min {p (z): z ∈ [−1, 1]}}}}}}} = 1. Then for any ρ> 2, the inclusion p ({z: | z - 1 | z + 1 | <}) ⊂ tn ({z: z - 1 | + | z + 1 | <ρ }), where is TN (Z) = 2N -1ZN+ ... - Polina Chebyshev. As the consequences from here, well -known inequalities of Chebyshev, Markov and Bernstein stem from here. The strengthening of some modern results for algebraic polynomas was also obtained [2].

Let D - a given convex bodily compact from RP, 96 A function N (X) satisfies the norms for RP. Then the task of constructing the ball layer of the smallest thickness is normal N (·), with the center from the compact D and containing its border, can be written in the form of φ (x) ≡ r (x) - ρω (x) → min Xorn 1) where r (x) = max y], ρω (x) = min yorn n (x - y), ω = rp \ d. The function R (x) is convex on RP, and the function ρω (x) is concave on D. Thus, the task (1) is the task of convex programming. In a number of works, it was considered for the case when n (x) - Euclidean norm (for example, [1]). We take the designations: ∂n (x) - subdifferent norm N (·) at the point x, k (x, a) - a cone of possible directions of the set A at the point X, k+ - conjugated cone to the cone K, Coa - convex shell of the set A, A+ b = {a+ b | a ∈ A, B ∈ B}, BN (x, r) = {y ∈ RP | n (x - y) ≤ r}, ∗ = Inf {α> 0 | x ∈ αA} - the function of the Minkovsky set A, qr (x, d) = {z ∈ D | r (x) = n (x - z)}, qρ (x, ω) = {z ∈ ω | ρω (x) = n (x - z)}, x (d) = arg min xorn φ (x), kv (RP) - the space of convex compacts from RP. 2. Here are some properties of solving the problem (1). Theorem 1. 1) In order for point x0 ∈ D to be a solution (1), it is necessary and enough to make the ratio ∂φ (x0) ∩k+(x0, d) 6 = Ø, where ∂φ (x0) = co { ∂n (x0 - z) / z ∈ QR (x0, d)++CO {∂n (x0 - z) ∩ −k+(z, d) / z ∈ Qρ (x0, ω)} (2) - The conditional superdifferential of the function φ (x) at point x0 on a set of D. 2) if the norm N (·) is strictly quasi -bass function, then the solution to the problem (1) is the only one: x (d) = {x0}. 3) If n (x) is the Euclidean norm, then X (D) = {x0} ∈ IntD. 97 4) Multiple display X (D): KV (RP) → 2R P is a semi -intake from above. Examples show that the solution of the problem (1) may be un UNITITY and some points from X (D) may belong to the border of the compact D. We also note that if the compact D and the ball of norm N (·) are polyhedra, then the task (1) comes down to solving the problem of linear programming. 3. For a numerical solution to the problem (1), convex programming methods can be used. When implementing the Kelly method (see, for example, [2]), taking into account the specifics of the task reflected in the subdifferiomic formula (2) of the target function φ (x), leads to the following scheme for constructing consistent approaches. Let the three objects have a three objects {dk, mk, xk} at the k-m step of the algorithm. In it, the DK and MK are polyhedra that contain the sets D and BN (OP, 1), and point XK ∈ D is the solution to the problem RK (x) - ρk (x) → min X]. (3) Here RK (x) = max y∈D wor (x - y), ρk (x) = min Yorn n (x - y). With k = 0, the choice of polyhedraries D0 ⊃ D and M0 ⊃ BN (0P, 1) are arbitrarily. We immediately note that the task (3) is reduced to the task of linear programming. The transition to the new triple {dk+1, mk+1, xk+1} is as follows. Building DK+1. If xk ∈ D, then at any point yk ∈ Qρ (xk, ω) we build supporting hyperplosiness π (yk) to D. If xk /∈ D, then we take any point yk ∈ D, for which ρd (xk) = n (xk - yk) and find hyperploster π (yk), separating D and BN (xk, ρd (xk)). The constructed hyperploster π (YK), along with the faces of the DK polyhedron, form a new dk+1 ⊃ D polyhedron. Building MK+1. We take any point zk ∈ QR (xk, d) and at the point zk - xk n (zk - xk) we build supporting hyperpravus π (zk) KBN (OP, 1). 98, together with the faces of the MK polyhedron, she forms a new multi -party MK+1 ⊃ BN (OP, 1). Now, as xk + 1, we take the solution to the problem (3) for k: = k + 1. Theorem 2. Any limiting point x ∗ sequence {xk} is a solution to the problem (1). In conclusion, we note that for the case when Norma N (·) is strictly quasi -puppy function, the task (1) is equivalent to the task of the best approximation of the compact D of the norm N (·) in the Hausdorf metric metric
