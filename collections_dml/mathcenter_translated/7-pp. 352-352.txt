Territory tasks of filtering with V.N. Emikh drand Institute of Hydrodynamics named after M.A. Lavrentieva SB RAS 630090 Novosibirsk, pr. Lavrentieva, 15 Root@Hydro. NSC. Ru mathematical modeling of filtration currents from the drain leads to multi -parametric mixed marginal tasks [1]. The prerequisite for their full hydrodynamic analysis is the preliminary calculation of the limiting drainage modes that occur on the verge of destabilization of free boundaries and indicating the framework of the implementation of the simulated course in the regional task. Hydrodynamically unstable and all filtration schemes behind these scope, which only allows them to carry out their selective analysis when setting the display parameters. The regional task itself preserves here only a shell of physical content, any content of which would require the expansion of setting the task [2]. The central place in the construction of mathematical models of Dreza is occupied by the parameters of conformal display from transcendental equations that connect these parameters with the input physical parameters of the filtration scheme; The capacity of the systems is preliminarily established on an analytical or numerical basis. Overcoming this most time -consuming stage of research opens the way for further studying the model of the filtration process in direct physical production. Literature 1. Emich in.
