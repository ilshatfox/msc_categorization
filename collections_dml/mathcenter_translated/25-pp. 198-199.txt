Approximation of the problem of minimizing the quadr functionality of the Hilbert space, a: x -+ y - linen operator, u u u u u u u u u u, llax - yll 2 -+ inf, x e x 198 - the exact extreme task and equation a* ah = ah = ah = ah = A*U (1) - a necessary and sufficient condition of the extremum. Let the spaces x, the spaces of X, respectively, TX, SX, TU, SY - operators of approximation and interpolation, operator A: x -; The operator A, U = Tuu, LLAX -! 711 2 -; Inf, heh, - the approximating extreme. I am the task and (2) - the necessary and sufficient condition of the extremum. With the help of the results of work [1], the following statements have been proved. 1. Spaces* and y* approximate the spaces x* and y*. 2. ll (a* - tha* sy) y* ll ~ sup \ j (a - syatx) x/· l \ y* ll · l!
