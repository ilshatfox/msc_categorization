The necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the spaces associated with weight spaces on the interval were obtained. Key words: Hilbert space, whole functions, reproducing nuclei, unconditional bases. Let H - the functional calbert space of whole functions. Functionality is understood in the sense that the point functionality Δz: f - → f (z), z ∈C is continuous. Due to the self -strengthening of the Hilbert spaces, these functionality are generated by elements of space H - kz (λ): Δz (f) = f (z) = (f (λ), kz (λ)) h, ∀ f ∈ H. The function k (λ, z) = kz (λ) is called the reproducing core of space H, and this object is studied in detail in [1]. This work is devoted to issues related to the bases and unconditional bases from the values ​​of the reproducing nucleus K (λ, ZK), {zk} inous k = 1 ⊂c. The basis {hn} mmn = 1 in a certain calbert space is called the unconditional basis ([2]), if for a certain number p> 1 and for any final set of an ∈ K.P. Isaev, A.V. Lutsenko, R.S.

The bases and adjacent questions were studied, for example, in [3]-[8]. The spaces of entire functions were considered more often integral-spring. In the work [7], conditions were obtained under which in an abstract functional hyalbert space there are no unconditional bases from the values ​​of the reproducing nucleus. With its origin, the task of (unconditional) bases from the values ​​of the reproducing nucleus is obliged, apparently, the classical topic of representation by the exponent in rows. If x is a certain calbert space of functions on the multiple g ⊂ c, in which the system of all exhibits EZT, Z ∈C is full, then the transformation of Fury-lapas l: s-→ ŝ (z) = s (ezt), z ∈C, It establishes isomorphism between the conjugated space of X ∗ and some space of whole functions X with the entrusted structure of the calbert space. Space X̂ will be functional, in it there is a reproducing core K (λ, z). If EZK t, k ∈ N, - (unconditional) basis in the space X, then the system K (λ, zk), k ∈N - (unconditional) basis in space X̂. The frequent use of this design in an explicit or implicit form in the theory of the series is due to the fact that in known cases this allowed us to use the device of the theory of entire functions. Namely, if k (λ, zk), k ∈ N - the basis in X̂ and LK (λ) is the bi -’base, it turned out that LK (λ) = L (λ) l TV (λ - zk) , k ∈N, where L is the so -called generating whole function with many simple zeros at zk points and understandable restrictions on growth in infinity. In general, a whole function that generates a whole function may not exist. To formulate the criterion of the existence of a generating whole function, we will give determination of the multiplicity of the zero of space and the stability of space. The multiplicity of zero of the whole function F at point A is designated through N F (A), that is, f (j) (A) = 0 for all non -negative integers J <n f (a). Determination 1. The multiplicity of zero of the calbert space of whole functions H at point A will call the integer NH (A) = min F ∈H N F (A), that is, F (J) (A) = 0, 0 ≤ J <NH (A) , ∀ f ∈ H. 164 Materials of the International School-Conference. Determination 2. Space H will be called stable at point A if from F ∈ H, N F (A)> NH (A) that F (λ) (λ --a) −1 ∈ H. We will call the space stable if it is stable anywhere. Theorem 1.
