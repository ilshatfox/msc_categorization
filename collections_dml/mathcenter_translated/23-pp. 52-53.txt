The incomparable elements in the Turing degrees of the Ershov hierarchy we study the problem of the existence of incomparable elements in the lower cones of turing degrees, limited by many from the Hererchy of Yershov. Let A - Nonal Turing degree. Through D (≤ a), we denote the lower cone of T-spons, limited by the degree A, i.e., the totality of T-spectacles, smaller or equal A. Consider the attendance of the problem of the existence of incomparable elements in the lower cones, limited to recursive-permitted degrees. Theorem 1. In the lower cone D (≤ a-r.) For any intermediate degree, there is R.P. degree with <a, incomparable with b. This theorem is proved using the priority method with endless violations. Let the cone D (≤ a) are limited by the degree belonging to the second level of the Ershov hierarchy, i.e., containing the difference in recursive and redesigned sets. In this case, the analogue of theorem 1 can no longer be proved using only 0 ′ ′ methods. Suppose that the opposite case is made, that is, in the lower cone D (≤ a) there is a degree with <a, such that for it in the cone D (≤ a) there are no incomparable elements. Then the following property is performed: theorem 2. Let in the lower cone D (≤ a-r. P.) there is an intermediate degree B, comparable to any degree C <a. Then B - recursively listed. Finally, the last theorem claims that if the degree A, like 54 degrees from theorem 2, exists, then it should be quite high in the degrees of degrees below 0 ′. Theorem 3. If a is an arbitrary non-melted Low2-spectacle containing a N-r. n. set, then in the lower cone D (≤ a) for each p. n. degree with <a exists nr. n. degree c, incomparable with b. L and T R A T R A 1.

N. A. Koreshkov (Kazan, Nikolai.koreshkov@ksu.ru) on the decomposition of the semi -resistant algebra of the associative type in the works [1], [2] was introduced into consideration of the Lyeevsky type algebra. Let us give its definition. Let G-a switching group, l-G-g-sorted algebra above the field K, i.e., l = ⊕αă cho lα, t ⊂ g, | t | <Mm and lαlβ ⊆ lα + β, if α + β ∈ T, and lαlβ = 0, if α + β 6] We will say that l is the Lyevsky -type algebra, if for any α, β, γ ∈ T are such λ = λ (α, β, γ), µ = µ (α, β, γ) ∈ K, λ 6 = 0 = 0 that if a ∈ Lα, b ∈ Lβ, C ∈ Lγ, then (AB) C = λA (BC) + µb (AC). If µ = µ (α, β, γ) = 0 for any α, β, γ ∈ T, then the algebra L will be called the algebra of the associative type. Just as for associative algebra, an ultimately algebra of the associative type will be called semi -resistant if it does not have inilpotent ideals, and simple, if it does not have non -trivial bilateral ideals.
