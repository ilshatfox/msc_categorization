Shakirov1 1 ISKANDER@TATNGPI.ru; Naberezhnye Chelninsky State Pedagogical University, corresponding to the classic operator Fourier of the Constant of the Lebaga is approached by logarithmic functions, depending on two parameters. The element of the best uniform approximation, the value of the best approximation and the algorithm of the sequential reduction of its initial value are indicated. Keywords: the norm of the operator Fourier, the best approximation, assessment of the Lebeg constant, an extreme task. Operator Fourier SN: C2π → C2π corresponds to the Constant of the Lebble ln = ∥sn∥ = 2 π ∫ π 2 0 | sin (2n +1) t | sin t d t, n ∈ N (l0 = 1), which, according to the well -known inequality of the label, directly affects the speed of uniform convergence of private sums of SN (x, t) to the initial function X (t). The results of the assessment of the LN constant from below, from above, on both sides and its asymptotic behavior can be found in the works of G. Vatson (1930), G. Hardy (1942), S.M. Nikolsky (1948), S.B. Stechkina (1955) , P.V. Galkin (1971), G.I. Nanson (1986) and other authors. From them it is clear that these grades improved sequentially. However, questions about the best close to replacing the Lebeg constant with logarithmic functions of a more general type, about the assessment of the error and solving the corresponding extreme problems, especially the algorithms for improving the best approaches in the literature. Most of these issues were resolved in the recent works of the author [1] - [3]. Using the property of strict decrease in the function of the error (argument n and parameters a, b) on (a, b) = ln - (4/π2) ln (n +a) - b, n ∈ N, (a, b) ∈ω- = [0.1/2] × [0.3/2], 376 Materials of the School-Conference in [1] We indicate a pair of numbers (a ∗, b ∗) ∈Pi-(a ∗ = 0.5, b ∗ = 1.271007777 ...), which, in the approximate equality of ln ≈ (4/π2) ln (n +a) +b, n ∈ N, (a, b) purpose - (1) provides the best uniform approximation, that is, it is a solution to the following Extreme task: Inf (a, b) ∈ω - Sup norn | ln - 4 π2 ln (n +a) −b | de F = ε1 = ε1 (ω -, n), ε1 = 0.00065453. . . . (2) The algorithm is given and substantiated here, which allows to consistently reduce the value of the best approximation ε1 based on the modification of the task (2). Consider it on the subsets n1 ⊃ n2 ⊃ put into each other. . . ⊃ nk ⊃. . . many natural numbers n = n1. For example, we choose N3 = {3.4.5,6 ,. . .} and N26 = {26,27,28,29 ,. . .}. Then on elements a ∗ 2 = 0.5, b ∗ 2 = 1.270347519. . . From the area ω - we have Inf (a, b) ∈ω - SUP n] | ln - 4 π2 ln (n +a) −b | de f = ε3, ε3 = 0.00012195. . . , (3) A on elements A ∗ 26 = 0.5, B ∗ 26 = 1.270347519. . . - Inf (a, b) ∈ω - Sup norn norn26 | ln - 4 π2 ln (n +a) −b | de F = ε26, ε26 = 0.00000231. . . . (4) Mark 1. The initial value of the best approximation ε1 B (3) is reduced more than 5 times (ε1/ε3 ≈ 5.36), and B (4) more than 284 times (ε1/ε26 ≈ 284.54). Note 2. The sequence of the best approaches (εk) strives for zero at a sufficiently high speed. Therefore, in (1) the Constant of the Lebeg can be approximately replaced by a logarithmic function with a given accuracy in advance (for example, the order of the error in (4) is already equal to one millionth).
