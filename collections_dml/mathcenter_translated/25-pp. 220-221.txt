-Differential integrates of the Jacobi system in private derivatives linear homogeneous system of equations in private production n l (aji (z) DZ, W + AJ, N + I (Z) DZ, W) = O, J = 1, T, (1 ) I = l will consider when its coefficients are irilinear functions [1, p. 21; 2] n a; k: z --t l (ajk {z { + ajk, n + {z {), vz e cn '{= 1 ajkl e s, k = 1.2n, l = 1.2n. At the same time, we will consider the system (1) Jacobieva, thereby ensuring the complete solvability of the task of the cat in the class of the IR head of the fyi functions. It is proposed to solve the problem of constructing the basis of the first in the tag of the system (1), for its private integrals, the framework of the Slavo, developed in [Z]. The spectral method is based on the 220 cyonal independent first integrals based on the presence of the Jacobiye system (1)! R-linear private integral. Theorem. Let V e C2N - the general own vector of matrices AZ = llazk1ll, j = 1, t. Then the function n p: z-+ '2) v (z (+ vn+ {z ()' vz e cn, {= 1 IR-linear on CN, is a 'private integral of the system (1). According to its own numbers of matrices, taking into account the multiplicity of the mental dividers and the corresponding to them of their own eyelids in the form is built. I am the basis of the IR -differentiated first integrals of the system (1). Literature 1. Shabat B.V.
