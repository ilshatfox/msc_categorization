One method for solving some regional problems of the riman type for biaanalytic functions §1. Set the tasks let T + - the final single -link area on the plane of the complex alternating z = x + iy, limited by a simple closed contour l, and l ∈ C3µ; and t - = c \ (t+∪l). For certainty, we assume that the point Z = 0 belongs to the T+area. The following two tasks are considered in this work (see, for example, [1], p. 289). It is required to find a piece-bialyalic functions f (z) = {f+(z), f-(z)} class A2 (t ±) ∩H (2) (L), which disappear on infinity and satisfying on L Next conditions: the task GR12 ∂f + (t) ∂x = g11 (t) ∂f - (t) ∂x + g12 (t) ∂f - (t) ∂x + g1 (t), (1) ∂f + (t) ∂y = G21 (t) ∂f - (t) ∂y −G22 (t) ∂f - (t) ∂y + ig2 (t); (2) The task is GR22 F+ (t) = g11 (t) f - (t)+ g12 (t) f - (t)+ g1 (t), (3) ∂f+ (t) ∂n+ = —G21 (t ) ∂f - (t) ∂n - + g22 (t) ∂f - (t) ∂n - + it′g2 (t), (4) where gkj (t), gk (t) (k = 1, 2; j = 1, 2) - the functions specified on L, and gkj (t) ∈ H (3–K) (L), GK (t) ∈ H (2–K) (L) and GKJ (T) 6 = 0 on L. Without violating the community, in the tasks of GR12 and GR22 we assume that f+(0) = 0. (5) note that in the case of G12 (t) ≡ g22 (t) ≡ 0, the tasks GR12 and GR22 are The main regional tasks for biaanalytic functions set by F.D. Gakhov (see [2], p. 316) and examined in detail in the works of K.M. Rasulova (see, for example, [1]). 78 §2. The solution to the problem of the GR12 is known (see, for example, [1], [2]) that any piece-bialyly function f (z) with the line of jumps of L can be represented in the form of: f (z) = {f+(z) = ip + 0 (z) + z̄ç + 1 (z), z ∈ T +, f - (z) = onic - 0 (z) + z̄ accord - 1 (z), z ∈ T -, (6) where vent (z) (∗ - i (z)) - analytical in t+(t -) functions (i.e., onic+i (z) ∈ A (t+), ∗ --i (z) ∈ A (t -) , i = 0, 1), moreover, ∗ - 1 (z) = 1 z2 f -1 (z), f - 1 (z) ∈ A (t -). (6A) We will look for a solution to the problem (1) - (2) in the form (6). Given the ratio ∂ ∂x = ∂ ∂z + ∂ ∂z̄, ∂ ∂y = i (∂ ∂z - ∂ ∂z̄), (∗) the regional condition (1) can be rewritten in the form φ + 0 (t) = g̃11 ( t) φ - 0 (t) + g̃12 (t) φ - 0 (t) + q0 (t), (7) where φ + 0 (z) = d accord (z)/dz, φ - 0 (z ) = zd accord (z)/dz, g̃11 (t) = t −1g11 (t), g̃12 (t) = t̄ −1g12 (t), q0 (t) = –t̄ dher+1 (t) dt - ∗ + 1 (t) + g11 (t) t̄ dwor - 1 (t) dt + g11 (t) ng - 1 (t) + + g12 (t) t dwor - 1 (t) dt + g12 (t) gment - 1 (t) + g1 (t). (8) temporarily counting Q0 (t) by the known function, equality (7) can be considered as a regional condition for the generalized task of Riemann with conjugation relative to the piece of-analytical function φ ± 0 (z), which disappears on infinity. Let κ0 = indg̃11 (t). It is known (see, for example, [3]) that if κ0> 0, then the general solution of the problem (7) is set by the formulas φ - 0 (z) = x --0 (z) 2πi ∫ l g̃12 (τ) φ - 0 (τ)+q0 (τ) x+0 (τ) dτ τ τ - z+x - 0 (z) pκ0–1 (z), z ∈ T -, (9) φ+0 (z) = x+0 (z) 2πi ∫ l g̃12 (τ) φ - 0 (τ) + q0 (τ) x + 0 (τ) dτ τ τ - z + x + 0 (z) pκ0–1 (z), z ∈ T +, ( 10) 79 where x0 (z) = {x+0 (z), x - 0 (z)} - canonical function of the usual task of Riemann with the coefficient G̃11 (t); Pκ0−1 (z) - Polin degree not higher than κ0 - 1 with arbitrary complex constant; Φ --0 (t) = - q0 (t) 2g̃11 (t) + x --0 (t) 2πi ∫ l q0 (τ) x + 0 (τ) dτ τ - t + + ∫ l γ1 (t, τ) q0 (τ) dτ + φ̃ - 0 (t), t ∈ L, (11) γ1 (t, τ) = - γ (t, τ) 2G̃11 (τ) - 1 2πi ∫ l γ (t, τ1) x - 0 (τ1) dτ1 x+0 (τ) (τ̄ - τ̄1); γ (t, τ) - generalized resolver of the nucleus of the equation of the type of fredgolm φ --0 (t) + ∫ l k (t, τ) φ --0 (τ) dτ = = - q0 (t) 2G̃11 (t) + x --0 ( t) 2πi ∫ l q0 (τ) x + 0 (τ) dτ τ τ - t + x - 0 (t) pκ0–1 (t), (12) k (t, τ) = - x - 0 (t) 2πIτ ′ 2 (σ) {[g̃12 (τ) x+0 (τ) - g̃12 (t) x+0 (t)] 1 τ - t++g̃12 (t) x+0 (t) [1 τ - t - τ ′ 2 (σ) τ̄ - t̄]}; Φ̃ - 0 (t) - the general solution of the integral equation of the type of fredgolm φ --0 (t) + ∫ l k (t, τ) φ --0 (τ) dτ = x - 0 (t) pκ0–1 (t). (13) If κ0 <0, then when fulfilling the conditions of re ∫ l   - q0 (t) 2G̃11 (t) + x --0 (t) 2πi ∫ l q0 (τ) x + 0 (τ) dτ τ - t    ψj (t) dt = 0, j = 1, ..., ν, (14) where δk (k = 1, ..., - κ0) - arbitrary real constant, and ψj (t) (j = 1, ..., ν) - the full system of linearly independent (above the field R) solutions of the equation, the union with the equation (12); and subject to the combination of the system of algebraic equations ν∑ k = 1 bjkδk = mj, j = 1, ..., - κ0, (15) 80 where the numbers bjk, mj are expressed in a certain way through the specified functions, the general solution of the problem (7) also It is determined by formulas (9) - (10), and the function φ --0 (t) - by formula (11), and φ̃ - 0 (t) - the general solution of the integral equation of the type of fredgolm φ --0 (t) + ∫ l k ( t, τ) φ --0 (τ) dτ = 0. (16) taking into account the designation (8), we will write the function (11) in the form φ --0 (t) = –t t̄ dwor - 1 (t) dt - taper - 1 (t) + ∫ l a - 1 (t, τ) dwor + 1 (τ) dτ + ∫ l a --0 (t, τ) onic + 1 (τ) dτ + ∫ l b - 1 (t, τ) dwor - 1 (τ) dτ dτ + ∫ l b --0 (t, τ) onic - 1 (τ) dτ + + ∫ l d -1 (t, τ) dwor - 1 (τ) dτ + ∫ l d --0 ( t, τ) ∗ - 1 (τ) dτ + + ∫ l e - 1 (t, τ) dwor + 1 (τ) dτ + ∫ l e --0 (t, τ) onic + 1 (τ) dτ + m - 0 (t), (17) where a --0 (t, τ) = - x --0 (t) 2πi (1 x+0 (τ) - 1 x+0 (t)) 1 τ - t, a1 ( t, τ) = - x --0 (t) 2πi (τ̄ x+0 (τ) - t̄ x+0 (t)) 1 τ - t, b - 0 (t, τ) = x --0 (
