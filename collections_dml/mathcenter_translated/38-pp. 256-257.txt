The method of regulator zero order in the task of restoring the derivative is considered the task of restoring the derivative of the derivative of the function F (x) E C1 [0, 1], set by its o-attaching f 0 (x) in the space L2 [0, 1]. This problem is solved by A. N. Tikhonov Zeroi Announcement [1] in relation to two integral equations of the first kind: (1) (2) where F1 (x) = xf (x), f2 (x) = (1-x) f (x), i1 (x) = J {(x), and2 (x) = f ~ (x). S. Yu. Advisor 257 If I1 (1) = · I2 (O) = O, then on the basis of [2] Tikhonovskaya re -gularization in this case gives uniform approaches to the solutions of equations (1) and (2). Then the close solutions of equations (1), (2) are from the equations by the close solution of the task will be the function where UF6 (x), and26 (x) - close solutions of equations (1) and (2) with some consent a b. For each of the equations, unreasonable errors are obtained indicating the order of B to the corresponding classes M1 = {I1 (x) E as, lj, u1 (l) = o, and '(x) E l2 [0, 1], 1i · u'jjl 2 ~ 1}; M2 = {i2 (x) e as, 1], · i2 (o) = o, and '(x) e f, 2 [0, 1], jji'i1l2 ~ 1} and formulas for coordination a = a (b).
