Pastens of a drop along the liquid substrate1 Belousova I.A. Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.G. Chebotareva of Kazan State University, one of the main anthropogenic pollutants of the aquatic environment, is organic fluids that are not laughing with water. Many of them are extremely toxic and have a close to zero limit to allow my concentration. All this makes them ecologically very dangerous. When such pollutants are lowered from the surface of the Earth to the groundwater mirror, that is, to the aeration zone, soil soil is imposed on the mechanism of physico-chemical spreading. To assess the buffer dispute of the aeration zone, it is important to know the characteristic speed of impregnation in various conditions. Assessments of this speed can be obtained from a solution to the model problem of spreading a drop of organic fluid on the water substrate. At the same time, crowds (in the basement models the water saturation of the soil in the aeration zone, and the size of the drop is the amount of pollutant. Z Fig. 1 In this work, a closed mathematical model of the drop of a drop through a liquid substrate is built. Particular attention was paid to the allocation of the main factors of the task and simplifying the description of the process Given its characteristic features. For this purpose, the region is divided into three zones, each with its specifics (Fig. 1). Zone 12 invents the position of the drop, zone 11 and 2 are parts of the water substrate, 1 work is performed in accordance with Project N 714 of the International Scientific Technical Center. 222
