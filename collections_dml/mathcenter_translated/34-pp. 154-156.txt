. Regularyized dual algorithm for the task of optimal management with the phase restriction of M. I. Lisachenko Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, lismisha@yandex.ru The report is devoted to dual regulatory [1] for a close solution to the problem of optimal management with the ceiling phase restriction and very convex targeted functionality. Let U ⊂ RR - convex compact, d ≡ {u ∈ Lux [t0, t]: u (t) ∈ U P.V. on [t0, t]}. The problem I0 (u) → min, i1 (u) ∈ m - ⊂ c [0, t], u ∈ D, (1) i0 (u) ≡ t t0 (〈a0 (t) x [u] (u] (u] (u] (u] (u) is considered t), x [u] (t)〉 + 〈b0 (t) u (t), u (t)〉) dt, i1 (u) ≡ g (·, x [u] (·), m - m - m - m - -the set of all incompatible functions in C [0, t], x [u] (t), t ∈ [0, t]-absolutely a timely solution to the linear system of ordinary differential equations ẋ = a (t) x (t) +b (t) u (t) + c (t), x (0) = x0, 156 corresponding to the control of u ∈ D. The algorithm of dual regulatory [1] is the direct solution of the problem Rα (λ) ≡ v (λ) - α‖ λ‖2 → max, λ ∈ M+ ⊂ l2 [0, t], α> 0, where m+ are many non -negative functions in l2 [0, t], v (λ) ≡ inf uurb (u, λ) , L (u, λ) ≡ i0 (u) + 〈λ, i1 (u)〉, u [λ] ≡ argmin {l (u, λ): u ∈ D}. It is shown that with the desire to zero the parameter of the regulatory of the α regulatory decisions U [λα], λα ≡ argmax {r; λ ∈ M+}, converge as the problem (1), regardless of this, exists or exists or exists There is no saddle point of the Lagrange functionality. The specified convergence is also preserved in the event of an error in the task of the initial data of the task (1). However, the indicated error should strive for zero in agreement with the regulatory parameter. The issue of iterative regulatory of this dual algorithm and the issue of stopping iteration about the cess in the case of the final fixed error of the task of the outcome data δ are considered. I express my sincere gratitude to the scientific supervisor Liu Professor M.I. Sumin for setting the task and attention to work.

Symmetry of Simmorphic crystallographic groups in the tasks of the theory of branching B.V. Loginov, O. V. Makeev Ulyanovsk State Technical University, O.Makeev@ulstu.ru, loginov@ulstu.ru in the theory of branching of non -linear equations, the tasks of impaired symmetry, When decisions with the symmetry of crystallographic groups, i.e., are born, that, when crossing the cavalry parameter, the bifur transition, that is, decisions with a symmetry of the broadcast lattice. Our works of the last two years have been continuing research on the subgroup structure of solutions of stationary and dynamic bifurcation problems with symmetry of senior critical systems of crystalline systems (algonium). In this work, the results obtained are illustrated by the example of a volume -centered γVQ grate of Chemical Class D4H. The volumetric -centered grate γ v q is composed of displacements A1 = TX, A2 = TY (A1 = A2) along mutually perpendicular to the second -order axes OX and OY and the display A3, which consists with the basic displacements A1 and A2 A3 - 12 (A1 + A2) ⊥ A1, A2, determines the displacement TZ = 2A3 - (A1 + A2), belonging to the lattice.
