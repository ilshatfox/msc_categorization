The uniqueness of the solution of one non -cabinal problem for the thermal conductivity equation by O. Danilkina Samara State Academy of Railways, danola@mail.ru The uniqueness of the solution of a mixed problem for a parabolic equation with a non -valve condition containing an integral operator is investigated. Consider in the area Qt = {(x, t): x ∈ (0, L), t ∈ (0, T)} Equation Ut - Uxx + C (X, T) U = F (X, T). (1) Put for him the task with the initial condition u (x, 0) = onic (x), (2) by the boundary condition u (0, t) = 0 (3) and non -cabbage condition u (l, t) = ∫ l 0 k (x, t) u (x, t) dx. (4) By solving the problem (1) - (4) we mean the function u (x, t) ∈ W 2.12 (Qt), which satisfies the conditions (2), (3), (4), and for any function η (x, t) ∈ W 2.12 (qt) The function u (x, t) satisfies the integral identity ∫ qt (ut - uxx + cu) η (x, t) dx dt = ∫ qt (x, t) η (x, t) dx dt. Theorem. Let 0 <c0 ≤ c (x, t) ≤ c1, | cx | ≤ c2, | cxx | ≤ ≤ c3, | ct | ≤ c4 p. C. In Qt, F (X, T) ∈ L2 (Qt), ∫ l 0 k2 (x, t) dx ≤ k0, 50 ∫ l 0 k2t (x, t) dx ≤ k1, t ∈ (0, T), K (x, 0) = 0, ∀x ∈ [0, l]. Then there is no more than one solution to the problem (1) - (4). To prove the theorem we get a priori assessment of the decision. Let us analyze the equalities ∫ qτ (ut - uxx + c (x, t) uxx dxdt = ∫ qτ f (x, t) uxx dxdt, ∫ qτ (ut - uxx + cu) ut dxdt = ∫ qτ f (x, t (x, t (x, t ) Ut dxdt, where τ ∈ [0, t], using the inequalities of Jung, Gronuoll ([1], p. 142) and inequality ([1], p. 77). Then ‖u‖ w 2.1 2 (qt) ≤ m (∫ qt f2 dxdt + ∫ l 0 (wor2 + onic) dx), (5) where the size m depends on Ci (i = 0, 4), k0, k0 K1, t, l. Assessment (5) shows that u = 0 p. C. In Qt with F, ∗ = 0. Therefore, there is no more than one solution to the problem (1) - (4). L and T R A T R A 1. Ladyzhenskaya O. A. Regional tasks of mathematical fi siki. - M.: Nauka, 1973. - 408 p.
