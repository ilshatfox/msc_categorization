. Filtered deformations of algebr Frank A. A. Ladilov Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, laddassm@hotmail.com due to the problem of classifying simple algebrics or low characteristics is of interest to study from the messenger series of exceptional simple algebrus Li. The work considers filtered deformations of al Goebr Lee of the Franc T (M) characteristics 3, the geometric implementation of which is built in the works [1] - [3] (see also [6]). Filtered algebra L Lee L is called filtered deformation of the graduated algebra L Lee if GRL = L. There are several approaches to the description of filtered de formations. In the work, a method based on the theorem of the filtered algebrus of the contact type in the ultimate algebra Lee obtained in the work [5] and the technique of description of deformations developed there were applied. The investment t = t (m) was also used in the contact algebra k = k (3: 1, 1, m), according to Brown [4]. According to [5] local filtered 148 deformations of algebra Ts are described by the H 1+ (T, K/T) subgroup in the first H1 claw (T, K/T) group. The work shows that h1+(t, k/t) = 0, and thereby the dawn of the dawn of the theorem. If L is the filtered algebra is such that grl = t (m), then l ∼ = t (m). The work was carried out with the support of the RFFI, project 05-01-00580. L and T R A T R A 1. Skryabin S.M. New series of simple algebris Lee // Matem.
