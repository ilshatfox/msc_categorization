The principle of the maximum for diversity over algebras found the type of A-differentiated functions on some varieties over local algebras, including compact ones. We use the results set forth in [1], [2], [3]. It is known that a ∼ = rd (a) ⊕r, ah ∼ = rd (a) h ⊕ rh [1]. As you know [1], A-differentiated functions G: am → A, Dimr A = N, have the form: G = EI · GI, I = 0 ,. . . , n - 1, where the EI is an attentive basis of the local algebra A, GI in a certain special material basis (which we will call standard), have the form: G (X1,., XM) = G (X1,., XM, XM ) + n∑ | p | = 1 1 p! Dpg dxp (x - x) p, and p = (p1, p2,., Pm), p! : = P1! P2! . . . PM!, | P | = P1 + P2 +. . . + pm, (x - x) p: = (x1 - x1) p1 (x2 - x2) p2. . .

Determination 1. Let b - the misery with the formation φ. Then we will say that the formation is closed if for each layer l of the layer φ l is compact, where L is the closure of the layer L. Determination 2. We call the extreme element of the standard base of the algebra A element ẽk = ei0, such that ẽk · el = 0, where l = 1 ,. . . , n - 1 or ẽk · rd (a) = 0 (note that E0 = 1 ∈ A and DIMR A = N). Others, i.e., not extreme, the elements are denoted by ĕj. Theorem 1. Let the m - a mile of local algebra a, canonical laying on m locally and in algebra a the standard basis is selected. Then the A-differentiated functions G: m → a, have the form G = A+ FK · ẽK, where a ∈ A FK-the basic functions of canonical laying on m. Theorem 2. Let M - diversity over the local algebra A and canonical laying on m Close, Dimr A = N, Dima M = M. Let π: n → b - local trivial stratification with a typical layer of RD (A) H, where Dimr b = h. Suppose that there is a atlas of this stratification φα: π -1 (uα) → uα × rd (a) h ⊂ rh ⊕ rd (a) h ∼ = ah, which sets on n the structure of diversity over algebra a. Then for any differentiated over a display f: m → n is performed: π °: m 7 → pt ∈ B, and in local coordinates F has the form F = ⊕HI = 1 (AI + F I, K · ẽI, K), where AI ∈ A, A, A Functions F I, K depend only on the transversal coordinates of canonical laying on m. Let the m - the might of A [1], ω - the space of differential forms on m, ωa ⊂ ωA ⊂ a ⊗ ω, ωA --Lin is the space of alinee forms [2], ωA - the space of the A -differentiated forms [3], That is, the Alain and such that the external differential from any representative of ωa is again a-Lineen. 89 Form ω ∈ ωA, ω = ei · ωi = ĕj · ω̆j + ẽk · ω̃k, where ωi ∈ ω or, what is the same, ω̆j ∈ ω, ωK ∈ ω; Ker {D} - the core of the external differential, (ker {d} ∩ ωja) - the space of closed A - differentiated forms. Ωs - the space of differential S -forms. We denote (for each J0) through ω̆ S, J0 ar ⊂ ωs some subspace in the space ωs, satisfying the following condition: ω̆ S, j0 ar = {ω̆j0 ∈ ωs | ∃ω ∈ ωA, ω = ĕJ1 · ω̆J1 + ĕJ0 · ω̆J0 + ĕj2 · ω̆j2 + ẽk · ω̃k}. We denote (for each J0) through zω̆ s, j0 ar ⊂ ωs some subspace in space ωs, satisfying the following condition: zω̆ s, j0 ar = {ω̆j0 ∈ ωs | ∃ω ∈ (ωA∩ker {d}), ω = ĕJ1 · Ω̆j1+ĕj0 · ω̆j0+ĕj2 · ω̆j2+ẽk · ω̃k}. We denote through zω̆sar ⊂ ĕj ⊗ zω̆ s, j AR some subspace in space ĕj ⊗ zω̆s, jar, satisfying the following condition: zω̆sar = {ω̆ ∈ ĕj ĕ zω̆ s, j ar | ∃ω ∈ (ωa ∩ ker {d}), ω = ω̆ + ẽK · ω̃K}. Theorem 3. Let the m - the mmature over the local algebra a, Dimr a = n, Dima M = M and the canonical laying on m is closed. In algebra A, a standard basis is selected. Then 1) the space Zapon is invested in the space A⊗H1 (M): 0 → Zω̆1ar → A⊗H 1 →. . . ; 2) the spaces are zω̆1, jar are invested in the space a⊗h1 (m): 0 → zω̆1, jar → a⊗h 1 →. . . ; 3) the spaces are zω̆1, jar are invested in Zω̆ 1 AR: 0 → Zω̆1, Jar → Zω̆ 1 AR →. . . .
