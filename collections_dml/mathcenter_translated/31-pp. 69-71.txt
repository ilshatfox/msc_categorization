One method of the approximate solution of integrated equations of scattering theory based on periodic bursts K. G. Zverev Kazan State University Zverev@pai.ru modeling of physical processes associated with the spread of electromagnetic waves is based on maxvella equations. A number of tasks, in particular, the tasks of scattering waves by periodic structures can be formulated in the form of regional tasks for the Helmholtz equation [1], [2]. These tasks are unambiguously solved in the class of quasiperiodic functions with partial radiation conditions at infinity [1]. IU 69 TOD of integral equations allows you to reduce the edge tasks to integral equations of the second kind, the latter can be considered at one period [3]. The work discusses the edge tasks in areas with a periodic wavy border (for example, y = k sin (πx/d)). Periodic bursts are used to build a periodic solution of the integral equation equivalent to the regional problem [4]. To substantiate the algorithm of a close solution in the work, a variant of the general theory of close methods is used [5]. L and T R A TSANG L., Ding K. H., AO C. A.

Zinchenko Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N. I. Lobachevsky, Vera_zinchenko@inbox.ru 70 Let Answers = (E, P, B, T K) - the main stratification with the projection p: e → B and the structural group T K = RK/ZK, R: B × ∆ → B - the action of the final group ∆ on the basis of B. The purpose of the work is the study of the multi -digit lifts of the action of R into the space of the stratification hole, agreed with the action of the structural group T K. Similar designs were studied in [1] for the case of smooth stratification. Here we consider b and e just “fairly good” topological spaces, for example, polyhedrings or cellular complexes. Suppose that the coating of U Base B is invariant regarding the action of R and there is an atlas A (u) of stratification hole associated with it. For cards ₽, μV ∈ A (u) with U ∩ v 6 = ∅ and elements Δ ∈ ∆ Consider the functions of the transition lection: u ∩ v → t k ising to ₽ and put τv uδ = ξuv ®rδ - ₽. Determination 1. Let the display τV uδ: u ∩ v → t k are locally constant for all U, v ∈ U and Δ ∈ ∆. Then A (u) we will agree to call almost ∆ atlas. Two such atlases will be considered equivalent if their association is also almost ∆-atlas. If a is the equivalence class of almost ∆ATlas A (u), then a pair ρ = (lection, a) will call almost ∆-parace. For cards ₽: u × t k → eu = p - 1 (u) we determine the actions of RU: EU × ∆ → EU with the formula ru (₽ (a, t), δ) = ₽ (a · δ, t). Determination 2. CREMR ​​= {RU | U ∈ U} We will be called pseudo-activity, and in the case when A (U) is almost ∆ ATlas-the multi-digit effect of the group ∆ on E. Continuous section H The stratification p ∗: ei → q where Q = {(x, v) ∈ Bi × E | X (0) = P (V)}, EI and BI are the spaces of ways in e and b, and p ∗ (y) = (p ° y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y, y (0)), is called T K-binding on lection, if h (x, v · t) = h (x, v) · t for all (x, v) ∈ Q and T ∈ T K [2]. 71
