Kuznetsov Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.G. Chebotareva Kazan State University SKOAL@ksu.ru Introduction. Traditionally, in the mechanics of a deformable solid body, a description of the medium was spread to a geometrically non-linear problem, according to which the state of elementary volume is described in the components of the vector of movements from the non-formed state to the deformed and 2nd tensor of the stresses of the piola-kirchof, also attributed to the non-formed volume. In this case, the marginal task is well formulated in differential or variation forms [7, 8, 15, 16, 18, 21], for the solution of which it is possible to use various numerical methods. However, a similar approach has a significant drawback in tasks with large deformations. It is associated with the complexity of constructing the determining ratios between the tensors used by stresses and deformations, which is especially manifested when postulating the determining ratios in the differential (speed) form. Within the framework of modern numerical methods (MKE, MKR, etc.), step methods (methods of consecutive loading) were developed, according to which the deformation process is represented as a sequence of equilibrium states, and the transition from the current state in the subsequent is determined by increasing the load (a change in the boundary conditions, areas of definition, etc.). These methods can conditionally be divided into [5, 11] into three subgroups: the first involves the use of the principle of virtual movements, in which all values ​​are attributed to the initial non -formed state; The second is based on the same variation equation, but the current metric is used as the base [4, 9, 10, 29]; The third is a combined lagranzhevo-elelean production, according to which 6 behavior of the material point (elementary volume) is monitored in accordance with the lagran method of describing the environment, but in the current state the task is to set the course of the environment in accordance with the Eilor approach [1, 2, 12, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17 , 20, 31]. In this work, the possibilities of applying the third approach are discussed in the study of large deformations of the environment, which has elastic, plastic and viscous properties. In particular, it is proposed to set the problem of the specified class in the current metric regarding the speeds of deformations, which, in combination with step loading and constant recount of geometry, makes it possible to implement the entire calculation process when organizing a solution based on MKE. At the same time, additive and multiplier decompositions of deformations into elastic and unlucky components are used, it is assumed that elastic deformations do not obey the linear law of Hook, and the associated law of the current should not necessarily be implemented. This expands the possibilities of the proposed calculation methodology from structures from classical structural materials to tasks with environments such as concrete, soils, etc. 1.
