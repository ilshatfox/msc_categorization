The limitations of nonlinear integrated functionals are known [1] that if the superposition operator fx = f (s, x (s)), where the function F (s, x) satisfies the conditions of karateodori, translates the space L prim (r+) to L1 (R+), then the norms of its values ​​are limited on each ball of the space Linger (R+). This is equivalent to the fact that the functionality is φx = φ∫ 0 | f (s, x (s) | DS is defined on Lux (R+) and is limited on each ball of this space. It turns out that this statement is also true in the case when the functionality is determined on a narrower set - the BC (R+) space - continuous and limited to R+ functions with the norm ‖X‖ = SUP T favor (t) |. We denote through the class of integral functionals defined on BC (R+), and having the form FX = و 0 F (s, x (s) ds, (1) where the core is the function F (s, x) - satisfies the conditions of karateodori. The following statements are fair. Theorem 1. Any functionality from class M is limited on each ball of the BC (R+) space. 110 Theorem 2. Any functionality from class M using formula (1) can be continued on the space of L prim (R+), and at the same time it will be limited on every ball of this space. L and T R A T R A 1.

Ivanov (Cheboksary) The construction of almost-periodic solutions of the first regional problem of the theory of elasticity for the area consisting of a strip and half-plate, a region consisting of a homogeneous-izotropic elastic strip (y ∈ [–h; 0], h> 0, –ura <x <mm) and the same half -plate (y ∈ [0; +∞), −urb <x < +φ), is in equilibrium. On the direct connection of y = 0, the conditions of rigid adhesion are set: u (1) (x, 0) = u (2) (x, 0), v (1) (x, 0) = v (2) (x, 0) , σ (1) y (x, 0) = σ (2) y (x, 0), τ (1) xy (x, 0) = τ (2) xy (x, 0). On the straight line y = −h, the boundary conditions of the 1st kind are set: σ (1) y (x,-h) = f (x), τ (1) xy (x,-h) = g (x). It is required to find stress functions σ (j) x (x, y), σ (j) y (x, y), τ (j) xy (x, y), j = 1, 2, and movements u (j) (j) ( x, y), v (j) (x, y) in a given area. The solution to the problem is built in the space of almost-periodic functions in the sense of boron with the help of generalized discrete 111
