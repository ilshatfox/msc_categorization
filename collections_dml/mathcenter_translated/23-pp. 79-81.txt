) The presentation of non -linear evolutionary equations through the factorization of differential operators in the well -known works of P. Laks, S.P. Novikov, I. M. Gelfand, L. A. Wild, I. Ya. Dorfman and others. There were many higher analogues of the Corteveg equation - de Friza and other nonlinear evolutionary equations (NEU). When constructing them, operator equations and, in particular, switches were used to one degree or another. Report 81 proposes a method for constructing an NEU of an arbitrary order, using the method of factorization of nonlinear differential operators [1, 2]. When calculating the coefficients of the equations of higher order, the systems of computer algebra Reduce and Maple were used. 1O built a new class of non-linear evolutionary equations of the nth order, depending on two arbitrary functions and n-1 parameters: ∂y ∂t + ∂x [v-v ∗ y 1∏ k = n-1 (∂ ∂x-(( v ∗ v + (k - 1) u ∗ u) ∂y ∂x - rku)]] y = 0, where rk = const, k = 1, n - 1, v = v (y), u = u (y ), (∗) = d/dy. Example 1. Equation of the motorcade - de friz yt + yxxx - 6yyx = 0 allows the presentation yt + 2 3 ∂x (∂x - r2 √ y) (∂x + 1 2 yx y - r1 √ y) y = 0, r1, 2 = ∓ 3√ 2. 2O built a new class of NEU N-th orderly, depending on two arbitrary functions and n parameters: un-1 (1-v ∗ v y) ∂y ∂t = 1∏ k = n [∂ ∂x-(v ∗ v + (v + ( k - 1) u ∗ u) ∂y ∂x - rku] y. Example 2. Harry's equation Dima y -3yt = yxxx allows the representation of y -3yt = (∂x + yx y) (∂x - 1 2 yx y) yx, where u = y–3/2, v = y2, r1 = R2 = R3 = 0. Example 3. Equation Harry Dima yt = 12 (y −1/2) xxx allows the representation of yt = −y - 3/2 (∂x - 3 2 yx y) 3y. Example 4. Harry Dima Equation of the 5th Order (cf. С [3]) allows the presentation yt = 1 4 ∂3x [y −5/2 (∂x-5 4 yx y) 2y] 82 and replacement of the variable y = z --4 is brought to the type of zt = - 116z5∂3x (Z5zxx). L and T R A 1. Berkovich L. M.
