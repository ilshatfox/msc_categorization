Local controllability of the system of differential equations of M.V. Yukhanov Ryazan State Pedagogical University named after S. A. Yesenina, dma@rspu.ryazan.ru The system of ordinary differential equations ẋ = a (t) x + b (t) u + f (t, x, u), (1) where x ∈ Rn, u is considered ∈ Rm-control, a (t)-(n × n)-brisk, b (t)-(n × m)-brisk, m <n, t ∈ [0, t], matrices A (t), b (t) continuous on [0, t], f (t, x, u)-N-dimensional vector-function. Denote | Y | = max 1≤i≤k {| yi |}, where y = (y1, y2, ..., yk); ‖B (.) ‖ = Sup tgr [0, t] ‖b (t) ‖; ‖B‖ = sup | z | <1 | bz | , B - matrix; H (δ0) = {(t, x, u): t ∈ [0, t], x ∈ Rn, u ∈ Rm, | x | ≤ Δ0, | u | ≤ Δ0}, W (Δ0) = {α ∈ RN: | α | ≤ Δ0}, number Δ0> 0. As acceptable controls, we will consider continuous on the segment [0, t] functions U (t) that satisfy the condition | U (·) | ≤ Δ0. The set of all permissible managements denote U (Δ0). Let the function F (t, x, u) satisfies the condition of the lips of the alternating X and U on the set H (Δ0). It is assumed that the system (1) satisfies the conditions of existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence of the solution on the initial data and the parameter. We denote the solution of the system (1) with the initial condition x (0) = α, which corresponds to the control of u ∈ U (δ0), as follows: t 7 → x = x (t, α, u), x (0, α, u) = α. 182
