Lobachevsky 2 ilnar.shafigullin@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mechanics and Mathematics named after N.I. Lobachevsky obtained sufficient conditions of the P-lidity of the Avhadiev-Becker type for harmonic display of the circle. Keywords: harmonic display, conditionalness of Becker, condition of multi -sized. Let H and G - holomorphic functions in a single circle d = {z ∈ C: | z | <1}. Consider the harmonic display of the type f (z) = h (z)+ g (z), z ∈ D. In the theory of the functions of the complex alternating, the study of the one -legged of the functions is of great importance. In this sense, the result of J. Becker is fundamental (see eg., [1] - [3]). Theorem 1. Let h: d → c - a holomorphic function that satisfies the condition h ′ (z) ̸ = 0. If for all z ∈ D there is an inequality (1- | z | 2) | zh ′ ′ (z)/h/h. ′ (Z) | ≤ 1, then the function H is single in D. In [4] the following generalization of the specified result in case of harmonic display was obtained: theorem 2. Let the functions H and G are holomorphic in a single circle D and satisfy the conditions h ′ (z) ̸ = 0 and | ω (z) | <1 anywhere z ∈ D, where ω (z): = g ′ (z)/h ′ (z). If inequality is executed | ω (z) | + (1 - | z | 2) ∣∣∣∣z h ′ ′ (z) h ′ (z) ∣∣∣∣≤ 1 ∀z ∈ D, then display f = h + G is single in D. Not only sufficient conditions of one-legged is widely of interest, but also sufficient P-Listen conditions, where P is a natural number. We will say that the function f is p is ps in some area, if a) for any W ∈C equation f (z) = W has nothing more than p roots, b) there is W0 ∈C that the equation f (z) = W0 has exactly P of the roots, taking into account their multiplicity. For analytical functions F.G. Avhadiev [5] received theorem 3. Let h Analytical at 0 <| z | <1, n - an integer, n ̸ = 0, and lim z → 0 z - nh (z) = a1 ∈C \ {0}. 270 Materials of the International School-Conference. The function H will be | n |-lithic in D, if SUP zsorn ∣∣∣∣ (1-| z | 2n) (N −1-z h ′ ′ (z) h ′ (z) ) ∣∣∣∣≤ | n |, | z | <1. In this work, following the scheme of evidence from [6], [7], we received sufficient conditions of multi -leafness such as Avhadiev -Becker for harmonic displays of the circle. Theorem 4. Let d = {z ∈ C: | z | <1}, n - an integer number, n ̸ = 0. Suppose that h and g are holomorphic in d \ {0}, h ′ (z) ̸ = 0 and | ω (z) | <1 for any z ∈ D \ {0}, where ω (Z) = G ′ (Z)/H ′ (Z), in addition, H satisfies the condition lim z → 0 z --nh (z) = 1. Then Harmonic function f (z) = h (z)+ g (z) will be | n |-lithic in d, if | n | | ω (z) |+ ∣∣∣∣ (1 - | z | 2n) (n −1 - z h ′ ′ (z) h ′ (z)) ∣∣∣∣≤ | n |, | z | <1. The work was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Total Research (project No. 14-01-00351-A), as well as with financial support for the Russian Fund for fundamental research and the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan as part of the scientific project No. 15-41-02433.
