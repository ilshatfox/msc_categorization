The conditions of investment of some classes of functions let LP-the space of 2π-periodic functions, with p = 1-summarized by (0, 2π) (‖f‖1 = 2π∫ 0 | f (x) | dx) or with p = φ-continuous on the entire axis (‖f‖ et = max xicle [0.2π] | f (x) |); En (F) P is the best of approximately 104 of the function F of trigonometric polynomas of the order not higher than N; K = 1, 2,. . . ; ωk (f, Δ) p (0 ≤ δ ≤ π) - k -n module of smoothness; F̃ - a function trigonometrically associated with F ([1]); σ (λ, f) ≡ λ0a0/2 + φ∑ ν = 1 λν (aν cos νx + bν sin νx) - converted by the sequence λ = {λν} φν = 0 row Fourier of the function f ∈ LP, where aν, where aa, Baν - Fourier factors Fourier F. If σ (λ, f) will be near the Fourier of some function from LP, then we denote it through F {λn}. In LP, consider the classes of functions: l̃p = {f: f̃ ∈ LP}, l {λn} p = {f: f: f {λn} ∈ LP}; Ephous = {f: en (f) p = o (onic (n - 1))}; Hk, ∗ {f: ωk (f, δ) p = o (onic (δ)}, where, like everywhere below, the major gment ffic (δ) is continuous on [0, 2π], onic (0) = = 0 , 0 <ffic (δ1) <onic (δ2) at 0 <δ1 ≤ Δ2 (onic ∈ φ, see [2], [3]). The following statements are true. Approval 1. Let onic ∈ φ; P = 1, Μ. Then Ephorp ⊂ l̃p ⇔ e pul ⊂ l {ln (n+2)} p. Statement 2. Let ∗ φ, Δ --k accord does not increase; p = 1, urb. Then hk, ∗p ⊂ l̃p ⇔ Hk, ∗p ⊂ l {ln (n+2)} p. The investigation. Let onic φ (δ --k accord does not increase); p = 1, φ. Then in order for any function f ∈ LP from EN (f) p = o (mon (n - 1)) (ωk (f, Δ) p = o (onic (δ))) F̃ ∈ LP (n + 2) → → → → → 0, Bn LN (n + 2) → 0 (n → φ), where an, BN is the factors Fourier functions f ∈ LP. Memorial 1. Statement 2 is formulated for k ∈ N. It is true for any K> 0, which can be shown, which can be shown , using the definition and properties of the module of the smoothness of the fractional order from [4]. M evening 2. Statement 2 is formulated for the function of one variable. It applies accordingly to the functions of many variables. 105 The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (project No. 03–01–00080). L and T R A T R A 1. Bari N.K.
