The permitability of one operator equation of O.V. Baeva Ryazan State Pedagogical University named after S. A. Yesenina, olga@par.ryazan.ru 22 The system of differential equations ∗ = µ (ε) + φ (ν, x, onic, t) (1) under the following conditions: a) x ∈ Rm, ship is considered Rn --m, ν = (λ, ε), ε ∈ Rn --m, λ ∈ Rm; b) µ, φ ∈ Rn --m; c) the right parts of the system (1) are continuous in their changes, t -periodic in t, 2π -periodic in ng, µ (0) = 0; d) equation µ (ε) = 0 has a solution ε ∗. Class 2π -periodic in wor and t -periodic in function F (∗, t) such that ‖f (onic, t) ‖ ≤ d, ‖ (∗ ′, t ′) -f (∗ ′ ′, t ′ ′) ‖ ≤ ∆1 · ‖ ′ ′ - ∗′‖+ ∆2 · ‖t ′ - t′′‖, denote C (D, ∆1, ∆2). The solution of the system of equations ∗ = µ (ε) + φ (ν, f (wor, t), onic, t), satisfying the initial data ∗ (0) = ∗0, are denoted by worked = rf (∗0, t). The operator equation µ (ε) · t + t∫ 0 φ (ν, f (onic, t), onic (t), t) dt = 0. (2) is considered the task: the task is set: determine the conditions under which equation (2) Responsible relative to ε. Various cases of resolving the operator equation (2) are investigated. The necessary conditions for the presentation of the Lax with the values ​​in compact algebrah Li 23 A. V. Balandin, O. N. Kashcheev, the Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N. I. Lobachevsky, Pakhareva@rambler.ru The systems of differential equations in private derivatives of the type uαxy + g α βγ β x u γ y + q α = 0 (α, β, γ = 1, n), (1) where X, Y - independent variables, gαβγ, q α - smooth functions from U1 ,. . . , Un. With arbitrary non -distinguished replacements Uα = Uα (V δ), the system (1) passes into a system of the same type, and the Gαβγ coefficients change according to the law of transformation of the coefficients of affinated connectedness, and Qα as the coordinates of the vector field. Therefore, Gαβγ can be considered as the symbols of Christopheli of a certain space of affinity V N in the local coordinate system U1 ,. . . , Un. Let G - algebra Lee with structural constants of CABC, set relative to a certain basis. We will say, following [1, 2] that the system (1) allows the representation of the laxa with the values ​​in algebra Li if the substitution of forms θa = (aaβu β x + m a) dx + (baβu β y + n a) DY ( 2) in the equations Dθa = 1 2 Cabcθ C ∧ θb (3) leads to identity by virtue of the system (1), i.e. forms (2) are quite integrated (according to the Frobenius) on the solutions of the system (1). Here AAβ, B A β, M A, Na - smooth functions from U1 ,. . . , Un and, possibly, a certain parameter λ. 24
