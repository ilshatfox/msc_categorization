) The regional task of the circulation flow of the underwater circuit with the formation of capillary and gravity waves will be considered in the coordinate system associated with the circular cylinder from radius A, the established stream of ideal, inconsistent weighty density ρ. Let the axis OX coincide with the unfinished level of the free surface and directed towards the stream, the axis Oy is directed vertically up and passes through the geometric center of the cylinder located at depth h. The flow rate on infinity in front of the contour is parallel to the OX axis and is equal to −u0. In the study, we will take into account the effects of gravity with acceleration G and surface tension forces on a free surface with a α coefficient. Within the framework of the theory of waves of small amplitude in the assumption of the potential of the course, the task boils down to determining the complex potential of the indignant course w (z) = onic (x, y) + iψ (x, y) at z = x + iy, satisfying on 274 free surface and on The cylinder is the following boundary conditions: re [αi ρg d2w (z) dz2 - u 2 0 g dw (z) dz - iw (z)] = 0, y = 0, (1) IMW (z) = u0y + ψ0, z ∈ C, ψ0 = const. (2) Imagine W (z) in the form of the amount w (z) = w ∗ (z) + wγ (z), where W ∗ (Z) is the complex potential of the indignant non -cycling course, satisfying the conditions (1), (2). The potential of the purely circulating course Wγ (Z) along with condition (1) also satisfies the conditions of IM wγ (z) = ψ1 (ψ1 = const), z ∈ C, ∆cWγ (z) = γ, (3) where ∆c is increment Functions with a positive bypass of C, and γ is the value of circulation. Since the non -cycle flow is investigated in [1], we will pay the main attention to the definition of Wγ (Z). We will look for the potential wγ (z) in the form of wγ (z) = γ 2πi ln z + ih - a2/(z̄γ - ih) z - zγ + + 1 2πi و −mber [1 z - t + a2 (t - ih ) 2 (z + ih - a2/(t - ih))] µγ (t) dt (4) or wγ (z) = w0γ (z) + vγ (z) + φγ (z), where vγ (z) - the comprehensive potential from the features of the material density µ (x), which is distributed along the uninocated level of the free surface, and φγ (z) - additional potential to vγ (z). The submarine function φγ (z), like W0γ, is built on the basis of the Miln-Tombson theorem about the circumference [2] in such a way that the potential Wγ (Z) in form (4) satisfies the conditions (3). To determine µγ (x) we use the condition (1). By substituting (3) B (1), we get re {αi ρg d2vγ dz2 - u 2 0 g dvγ dz - Ivγ + + (αi ρg d2 dz2 - u 2 0 g d dz - i) [w1γ (z) + ω (z )]} y = 0, (5) where w1γ (z) = - γ 2πi ln (z - zγ), ω (z) = φ (z) + w0γ (z) −W1γ (z). 275 Equation (5) is equivalent to the following: re {αi ρg d2λ dz2 - u 2 0 g dλ dz - λ ρ ρg d2 dz2 - u 2 0 g d dz + i) ω̄ (z)} = 0 with y = 0 where λ (z) = vγ (z) + w1γ (z). Using the regularity of the function in curly brackets in the lower semi -plate, we obtain αi ρg d2λ dz2 - u 2 0 g dλ dz - iλ + (−αi ρg d2 dz2 - u 2 0 g d dz + i) [ω̄ (z)] = 0. ( 6) the general solution of the equation (6) has the form λ (Z) = C1 EXP (S1Z) + C2 Exp (S2Z), (7) C1 (Z) = G U20 S0 ∫ Exp ( - S1Z) A (Z) DZ, C2 (Z) = - G U20 S0 ∫ EXP (–S2Z) A (Z) DZ, S0 = √ 1–4αG/ (ρU40), S1 = - ρU20 i 2α (1 + S0), S2 = - ρU20 i 2ααααα (1- S0), A (Z) = (αi ρg d2 dz2 + u20 g d dz - i) ω̄ (z). By changing the integration procedure, after the transformations we find vγ (z) = γ 2πi ln (z - zγ) - γg 2πu20 s0 (1/s1 - 1/s2) ln [z - ih - a2 zγ + ih] + γ 2πs0 b1 Exp (s1z) z∫ −mber exp (—s1t) t - ih - a2/ (zγ + ih) dt - - γ 2πs0 b2 exp (s2z) z∫ و T - IH - A2/ (zγ + ih) dt+ - g s0u 2 0    exp (s1z) 2πi ∮ l   − − − char (—s1t) d (t, ̄) dt  µ µ (µ (µ (µ (µ,) –exp (s2z) 2πi ∮ L   z∫ φ exp (—s2t) d (t,) dt  µ µ (µ (µς) d expensē                , (8) 276 bj = 1 s0 ( - αsj ρu20 + i + g sju 2 0), j = 1, 2, d (t, ̄) = −2αi ρg (t - ») 3 + u20 g (t -») 2 + i t - », na (t) = −ih + a 2/ (t - (t - 2/ (t - 2/ (t - 2/ (t - 2/ (t - IH), where the circuit l is obtained by the inversion of the OX axis relative to the circle. The limits of ± φ in the integrals are placed taking into account the condition of the radiation before the false in [3]. The number S1 refers to the waves in the formation of which capillary plays the main role; Observations show that capillary waves form towards the stream in front of the obstacle. The number S2 refers to the waves, the main participation in the formation of which the force of gravity plays; Gravity waves develop behind an obstacle. From (8) for y → 0, taking into account the previously introduced representation for vγ (z), we get µγ (x) = σγ (x) + و µ −mm K (x, t) µ (t) dt, (9) σγ (x) = γ π re [i ln x - z̄γ x + ih - a2/ (z̄γ - ih) + + b̄1 exp (s̄1x) x∫ − char (—s̄1t) t + ih - a2/ (z̄γ - ih ) dt - b̄2 exp (s̄2x) x∫ φ exp (—s̄2t) t + ih - a2/ (z̄γ - ih) dt], k (x, t) = - 1 π g u20 s0 IM [αi (s̄1 - S̄2) ρg h (x, t) + + e (s̄1) exp (s̄1x) x∫ − char (—s̄1λ) h (λ, t) dord - - e (s̄2) exp (s̄2x) x∫ φ exp ( - --2λ) h (λ, t) dλ  , h (λ, t) = a2 (λ - λ λna (t)) (t - ih) 2, e (s̄j) = −i - u20 g s̄j + αis̄2j ρg (j = 1, 2). Equation (9) is easy to lead to a dimensionless form. In this case, the number of Frud Fr = U0/ √ GA and the Weber Weber Web = α/ (G’s2) are distinguished.
