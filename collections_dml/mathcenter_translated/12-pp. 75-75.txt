Nutrition on the border of the media section during welding by explosion I.V. Vamzova, A.V. Kuznetsov Research Institute of Matelstiki and Shi mechanics. N.G. Chebotarev of the Kazaisian state -owned university based on the hydrodynamic model investigated the effect of gravity and surface tension on the form of contact of the contact of the meals of the Tallic plates when welding by explosion [!]. Two flat jets with a fluid with a fluid are condemned with each other at a small angle. The fluid course is considered stationary, long -standing on the free boundaries constant, pressure and normal with the fluid speed at the contact boundary are continuous. As a result of satisfying the boundary conditions, the task came to the Tegro-differential equation, the solution of which is the method of Wiener-Hopf [2]. During the solution, it was found that when the flows with various densities interacts, gravitational waves always occur, but when welding an explosion occurring at high speeds of the racing, gravitational straps have practically no place for their large length. Capal. 1 Yarny waves caused by surface tension, take place with the values ​​of the number of weber, surpassing a certain value, depending on the relationship of the densities of sample plates.
