Agachev1, M.Yu. Pershagin2 1 juriy.agachev@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 Michael.pershagin@kpfu.ru; The Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the article in a pair of Sobolev’s weight spaces is justified by the polynomial method of collocation by the nodes of Chebyshev’s nodes of regional problems for ordinary integro -radio equations in the case when the order of the internal differential operator above the corresponding external. 16 “Lobachev readings - 2019” Keywords: Sobolev’s space, Jacobi -hegenbauer weight, integro - differential equation, task task, polynomial approximation, collocation method, convergence of the method, let M + 1, p ∈ N, p> m. It is considered, for certainty, the unambiguous task of koshi1 x (i) ( - 1) = 0, i = 1, m, (1) for the integro -radio equation k x ≡ x (m) (t)+ m∑ k = 1 gk (t) x (m --k) (t) + p∑ j = 0 + 1∫ −1 h j (t, s) x (j) (s) d s = y (t), −1 ≤ t ≤ 1 , (2) where y (t), gk (t), k = 1, m, and h j (t, s), j = 0, p are known functions in their areas of definition. Let ρ (t) = p 1 - t 2 - the weight of Chebyshev of the second kind, ql (t) = {ρ (t)} 2l - 1, l +1 ∈N, - the weight of Jacobi -gegenbauer. We denote via L2, QL ≡ L2, QL (−1,1) - the space of the functions of the functions, quadratically shed with weight QL (t) in the interval (−1,1), w r l2, qr ≡ w r l2, qr [ −1,1], r ∈ N, - the space of the Sobolev functions f (t) ∈ L2, ρ that have derivatives f (l) (t) ∈ L2, QL, 1 ≤ L ≤ R. The norm in the space w r l2, qr is set according to the formula ∥ f ∥r; 2, qr =   +1∫ −1 r∑ l = 0 ql (t) | F (l) (t) | 2D T 1/2. We also introduce L1 spaces of functions in the interval (−1.1) and W SL2, QR ≡ W SL2, QR [−1,1], S> R, continuous functions F (t), for which there is a derivative f (S- r) (t) ∈W R l2, qr. In the space W SL2, QR, we set the midnight according to the formula ∥ f ∥s; 2, qr = ∥ f (s --r) ∥r; 2, qr. (3) the task (1), (2) we will consider (with appropriate requirements of the relative coefficients of the equation) in a pair of spaces (x, y), where y = w r l2, qr, r = p −m ≥ 1, x = ® W P L2, QR - a subspace of functions from W P L2, QR, satisfying the initial conditions (1). In the space of the X midnight (3) it is a norm according to which, obviously, X becomes complete. In a pair of spaces (x, y), the initial (unambiguously permitted) task can be recorded in the operator: k x ≡ dx +gx +h x = y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y), (4) where dx ≡ x (4) (4) m) (t), gx ≡ (gx) (t) = m∑ k = 1 gk (t) x (m -k) (t), 1 for m = 0 initial conditions are absent. Yu.R. Agachev, M.Yu. Pershagin 17 H x ≡ (h x) (t) = p∑ j = 0 +1∫ −1 h j (t, s) x (j) (s) d s. The possibility of using the computing scheme of the collocation method, usually used for the tasks correctly set according to Adamar, gives the following (see in [1]) Lemma 1. Let the conditions are fulfilled: 1) gk, k = 1, m, y ∈ Y; 2) there is a derivative ∂r h j (t, s) ∂t r ∈ L2, QR × L1, J = 0, M −1; 3) There is a derivative ∂r h j (t, s) ∂t r ∈ L2, QR × L2, QM - J, J = M, P. Then the following statements are fair: 1 °. Operator D: X → Y has a continuous reverse D -1: Y → X, moreover, ∥D∥X → Y = ∥D - 1∥y → X = 1. 2®. Operators G: X → Y and H: X → Y are quite continuous. The approximate solution of the problem (1), (2) will be searched in the form of xn (t) = n∑ k = 0 ck tk (t), (5) where TK (t) is the Polynomas of the Chebyshev I-Roda. Unknown coefficients {ck} are determined from conditions (k xn) (t j) = y (t j), j = 0, n, (6) where t j are the nodes of Chebyshev I-rode. Conditions (6) relative to {ck} are a system of linear algebraic equations of the form n∑ k = 0 αk j ck = y j, j = 0, n, (7) where y j = y (t j), αk j = (k tk) (t j). (8) We denote through SN-the Fourier operator, built according to the Polynoma system of Chebyshev I-Roda and via LN-Lagrange operator, built by nodes {t j}. Conditions (6), as it is easy to see, are equivalent to the ratios ((k xn - y) —sn (k xn - y)+ln (k xn - y), t j) = 0, j = 0, n. We introduce into consideration a new integro - -differential equation k̃ x = ỹ, x ∈ X, ỹ ∈ Y, (9) where k̃ x ≡ k x ≡snk x +lNK x, ỹ = y –sn y +ln y. The following 18 “Lobachev readings - 2019” Lemma 2. The method of collocating the solution of the problem (1), (2) is equivalent to the Galerkin method of solving the equation (9). Indeed, by designating for brevity z ≡ k xn-Y, we have SN (K xn-Y) ≡ SN Z = ∑n K = 0 C T K (Z) T̃K, where t̃k is normalized polynomas of Chebyshev I-Roda; Ln (k xn - y) ≡ ln z = ∑n k = 0 z (tk) lk (t), where lk (t) is fundamental lagrange polynomas by nodes {t j}.
