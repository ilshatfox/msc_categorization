UDC 517.54 Hilbert's homogeneous task with the final number of swindle points of the logarithmic order A.Kh. Fatykhov1, P.L. Shabalin2 1 vitofat@gmail.com; Kazan State Architectural and Construction University 2 Pavel.shabalin@mail.ru; The Kazan State Architectural and Civil Engineering University discusses the construction of a formula for the general solution of Hilbert’s homogeneous problem with a regional condition on the circumference and the final number of points of bilateral swindle of the degree-logarithmic order in the class of limited analytical functions, the study of the existence of a solution and describing many solutions, in case of un UNY. Key words: Hilbert's task with an endless index, whole functions of a refined zero order, the principle of maximum. The work investigates the task of determining the analytical and limited in a single circle d = {z = r eiθ: 0 <r <1.0 ≤ θ <2π}, l = ∂d, the plane of the complex variable z = x + i y, the function φ ( z), according to the regional condition ℜ [e -iν (θ) φ (t)] = 0, t = eiθ ∈ L, t ̸ = t j, t j = eiθ j, j = 1, n, (1) in the case, in the case When the argument of the coefficient of the regional condition ν (θ) has a final number of points of rupture of the second kind (twin points) of the degree-logarithmic order. Exactly, ν (θ) = n∑ j = 1 ν j (θ)+ ν̃ (θ), ν j (θ) =  ν ν+ j ln α J 1 | sin (θ --Θ j)/2) | , 0 ≤ θ <θ j, ν --j ln α J 1 | sin ((θ --θ j)/2) | , θ J <θ ≤ 2π, (2) for some numbers ν+ j, ν --j, α J, 0 <α J; The function ν̃ (θ) is continuous on the Helder on A.Kh. Fatykhov, P.L. Shabalin 339 intervals (0.2π) and satisfies the condition ν̃ (0) - ν̃ (2π) = n∑ j = 1 (ν --j --ν+j) l nα J 1 sin (θ J /2). A similar task, but with the final number of points of bilateral twisting of the steppe, less than a unit of order has been studied in [1], in which the formula of the general decision was obtained and a complete picture of resolving in the class of limited analytical functions is given. By the method of regulating the multiplier using the generalized principle of the maximum for analytical functions from [2] the following theorem has been proven. The general solution of the problem (1), (2) in the class of limited in a single circle of analytical functions is set by the formula φ (z) = −i eiγ j (z) ei g (z) f j (z), in which f j (z) - arbitrary analytical in D function that satisfies the condition of growth restriction | F J (Z) | ≤c1ec2 ln α J +1 (1/| z - t j |), z → t j, z ∈ D, c1> 0, C2> 0, and on the border conditions: ℑf j (t) = 0, t ∈ L, t ̸ = t j, | f j (t) | ≤Ceq j (θ), t = eiison. Here is γ j (z) - an integral type of cat on a material axis with a continuous helder, including an infinitely removed point, density, g j (z): = g y ° j (z), g j (ζ) = ζ πi +φ ∫ −mm p j (τ) τ (τ - ζ) dτ, ζ j (z) = i t j + z t j - z, t j = eiθ j, j = 1, n. The last integral of the type of koshi is taken along the material axis from the density p j (τ) =  ν ν --j ln α J | τ |+ω (τ), τ ∈ (− least, −1), ω (τ) , τ ∈ (−1,1), ν+j ln α j τ+ω (τ), τ ∈ (1,+urb), (3) where the call (τ) is continuous on the helder on the material axis, including an infinitely removed point . Function Q j (θ) = ℑg j (eiθ). Регуляризация краевого условия здесь проводится с применением асимптотической формулы П.Г .Юрова [3] для вычисления интеграла типа Коши  G j (ζ) = ζ  πi  +∞∫ 1  lnα j τ  τ(τ−ζ)dτ. In addition to the task (1), (2) with n points of twist of the degree-logarithmic order, we will also consider n the Hilbert's homogeneous tasks on the circle, each with the only point of twisting the degree-logarithmic order T J, J = 1, N: ℜ [e --iµ j (θ) φ (t)] = 0, t ∈ L, t ̸ = t j, (4) 340 Materials of the School-Conference µ j (θ) = ν j (θ)+ ν̃ j (θ), ν j ( θ) =   ν+j ln α J 1 | sin ((θ --θ j)/2) | , 0 ≤ θ <θ j, ν --j ln α J 1 | sin ((θ --θ j)/2) | , θ j <θ ≤ 2π, (5) where ν̃ j (0) is any continuous in the gelder on the interval [0.2π] a function that satisfies the condition ν̃ j (0) - ν̃ j (2π) = (ν --j - ν+j) l nα j 1 sin (θ j /2). The following theorem. Hilbert’s the commodity task (1), (2) is solved in the class of limited analytical in D functions, if only if each of the N tasks (4), (5) is solved. The complete picture of the solvability of Hilbert’s homogeneous task with the only point of twisting the degree-logarithmic order is contained in the work ([4]) the work was performed with the financial support of the RFFI (project No. 17-01-00282A).
