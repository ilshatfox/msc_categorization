One analogue of the integral formula of the plan V.I. Kuzovatov1 1 kuzovatov@yandex.ru; The Siberian Federal University in the work received an analogue of the formula of the plan, which is essential when the functional ratio for the classical zeta-function of Riemann. Key words: plan formula, a whole function, integral representation. The aim of this work is to obtain an analogue of the formula of the plan, which is essential in the functional ratio for the classical dzeta-function of Riemann. The classical formula of the plan expresses the sum of values ​​at entire points of the holomorphic and limited (for all values ​​Z, for which x1 ≤ re z ≤ x2, x1, x2 - integers) functions С (z) through some integrals. Namely, 1 2 onic (x1)+onic (x1 +1)+onic (x1 +2)+. . . + ∗ (x2 −1) + 1 2 onic (x2) = x2∫ x1 onic (z) d z + 1 i و 0 onic (x2 + i y) – pul (x2 - i y) + gment (x1 - i y ) −arent (x1 + i y) e2πy −1 d y. If we talk about generalizations of dzeta-function, then I.M. Gelfand, B.M. Levitan and L.A. Wild studied the zeta-function associated with its own values ​​of the Liwill operator in the 50s of the last century. Its value turned out to be related to this operator. Their approach was further developed by V.B. Lidsky and V.A. Sadovniki (60 years), who examined the class of whole fluxions of one alternating, determined for them the zeta-function of the roots and studied its area of ​​analytical continuations. S.A. Smaginim.A. Schubinproedalidzeta-Function of Elliptical Operators and Operators of more generally, proved the possibility of a middle continuation of dzeta-function and gave some information about the poles. Let f (z) - a whole function of order ρ in C. Consider the equation f (z) = 0. (1), we denote through the F = F −1 (0) the set of all the roots of the equation (1) (each root is considered so many times, what its frequency). The number of roots is nothing more than counting. Zeta-functions ζ f (s) of the roots of the equation (1) are determined as follows: ζ f (s) = ∑ aorn f (—a) —s, 70 materials of the youth school-conference where s ∈C. The minus sign in the definition of dzeta-function is taken for the convenience of recording integrated formulas. Let us give an integral representation for zeal-function ζ F (s) zn zn functions F, which have the form ZN = qn + I SN, QN> 0. Denote F (F, X) = ger n = 1 EZN X (2) And suppose that Re S = σ> 1 and the following conditions are met: Lim N → ° QN N> 0, (3) row ux n = 1 (1 QN) σ - 1 converges. (4) For the convergence of a series (2), taking into account (3), it is necessary and enough for x> 0. Theorem. Let the conditions (3), (4) and Res> 1. 2). In this work, we will assume that zn zn zn = −qn, QN> 0, where QN form a certain sequence of natural numbers. Consider the function F (f, 2πi z) = φ∑ n = 1 ezn2πi z = ger∑ n = 1 e -qn2πi z. (5) the area of ​​convergence of the row F (F, 2πi Z), determined by the formula (5), is the multi -fiction set by the condition y <0. Using the replacement of E -2πi z = w rows (5) is brought to the form∑ n = n = n = n = n = n = n = n = n = n = n = 1 w qn or g (w) = φ∑ n = 1 fn w n, (6) where the FN coefficients are determined as follows: fn = {1, n = qk 0, n ̸ = qk, therefore limn → nder n √∣∣∣∣∣∣ fn∣∣ = 1. Note that in a series (6) an infinite number of FN coefficients is excellent from zero. IN AND. Kuzovatov 71 at | W | → 1–0 G (W) function becomes unlimited, but is a holomorphic in a single circle. Thus, G (W) does not continue at point 1. The factory theorem on the gaps shows that you can choose the coefficients of the row so that the resulting function G (W) the entire circle will be a natural boundary. In the future, we limit ourselves to the consideration of classes of rational functions G (W), for which it is fair (6). Regarding this, we formulate the following result. Sege theorem. The steppe row G (w) = φ∑ 0 fn w n, (7) the coefficients of which FN can take only the final number of different values, or is a rational function, or is not laid beyond the limits of a single circle. In case of rationality of the amount of the series (7) g (w) = p (w) 1 - w, where p (w) is polynomial, and n is a certain natural number. This means that only points WK = EI 2π n K, k = 0.1,. . . , N −1, n purpose. In variables Z for the function F (F, 2πi Z), special points will be e -2πi z = wk, −2πi z = i (2π n k + 2πl), z = - (k n + l), l = 0, ± 1, ± 2 ,. . . , or something the same zk, l = l - k n, l = 0, ± 1, ± 2 ,. . . , k = 0.1 ,. . . , N −1. Let the ratio be made for QN (3). Suppose additional that Degp (W) = N, that is, p (w) = a1w + a2w2 +. . . +AN -1W N -1 +W N, where the coefficients A j ∈ {0.1} due to the decomposition (6), j = 1 ,. . . , N −1. If DEGP (W)> N, then in the expression for G (W) you can distinguish a whole part that will contain only the final number of terms, and on elements G (W), starting from a certain number, these components will not have influences. If Degp (W) ≤ N, then
