Solving the regional problems of oil and gas supplants with water 245 by one of the rational ways of developing oil discharge is a decrease in pressure on the slaves of wells below the pressure of saturation. The work investigates the processes of oil and gas suppression with water, taking into account the mentioned facto on the basis of a two -dimensional model for a three -phase filtration of binary hydrocarbon mixture with water (Christmas Shovkrinsky). This model is a special case of a painting film of multicomponent mixtures, when the number of hydrocarbon components is equal to two and a hydrocarbon mixture of the section on conditionally for non -lethal oil and gas gas. The results of solving specific problems are given and IU is following the impact on technological indicators to develop the oil reservoir of pressure on the slaves of wells below the saturation pressure in the conditions of the nine -pointed factory. Within the framework of the adopted model of a two -dimensional three -phase film of a hydrocarbon mixture with water with a decrease in the upbringing pressure of wells below the saturation pressure, the deadlines for the development of the oil formation are significantly painted, the investigator but the current development indicators increase. However, its influence on the final values ​​of the coefficients of oil and laws of return is very insignificant.
