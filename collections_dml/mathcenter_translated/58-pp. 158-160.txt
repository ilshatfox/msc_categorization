"Lobachev readings - 2019" UDC 517.95 + 532 On group analysis of the equations of the hydrostatic model of viscous fluid A.A. Rodionov1, D.A. Krasnov2 1 Aarod54@mail.ru; Siberian Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Fundamental Informatics 2 Krasnova-d@mail.ru; Siberian Federal University, the Institute of Mathematics and Fundamental Informatics The article discusses the group properties of the equations of a three-dimensional hydrostatic model of viscous fluid. An example of an exact solution is presented. Key words: group analysis, hydrostatic model, viscous fluid, accurate solutions consider three-dimensional equations of the Nastye-toe of the movement of viscous inconspicuous fluid. It is assumed that the pressure in the liquid is linearly depends on the depth, pz = −G. This assumption is often used in the description of processes in oceanology [1]. Then p (x, y, z, t) = −g z + q (x, y, t), where Q (x, y, t) is a new function. In this case, the system of Equation of the Nastye-Khoksa has the form: Ut +Uux +Vuy +Wuz +QX = ν (uxx +uy y +uzz), vt +uvx +vy +w vz +QY = ν (VXX +VY Y + vzz), wt +uwx +v wy +w wz = ν (wxx +wy y +wzz), ux +vy +wz = 0, qz = 0. (1) here u, v, w are components of the speed vector in directions x, y, z, p - pressure, t - time, g = const> 0 - acceleration of gravity in the direction of the axis Z, ν - the coefficient of dynamic viscosity, ρ is the density of the liquid (can be considered ρ = 1). On the free border of the liquid γ: z = η (x, y, t) kinematic and dynamic conditions are fulfilled: ηt +u (x, y, η (x, y, t), t) ηx +u (x, y, η (X, Y, T), T) ηY = W (X, Y, η (X, Y, T), T), (PA --P) - → N +2νD · - → N = 2σH - → N, where PA (x, y, t) is atmospheric pressure, p | γ = −gη (x, y, t)+ q (x, y, t), normal to the free surface - → n and the average curvature h depend on the position Points on the surface, σ = const - surface tension coefficient, D = D (U, V, W) - tensor of deformation speeds [2]. The task of group analysis is set [3] for the system equations (1). It is required to find the algebra of whether permissible operators and build accurate solutions. A similar study of the hydrostatic model of ideal fluid was carried out in [4]. A.A. Rodionov, D.A. Krasnova 159 as a result of group analysis, it was proved that algebra is formers X1 = ∂T, X2 = ∂Z, X3 = T∂z + ∂W, X4 = X∂x + Y∂y + Z for the system of equations (1). ∂z +2t∂t −u∂u - v∂v −w∂w −2q∂q, x5 = x∂y - y∂x +u∂v - v∂u, x6 = f (t) ∂x + F ′ (t) ∂u −x f ′ ′ (t) ∂q, x7 = h (t) ∂y +h ′ (t) ∂v - yh ′ (t) ∂q, x8 = onic (t) ∂ ∂ ∂ Q. (2) The first operator is responsible for the transfer of time t, the second and third - for the transfer and transformation of Galileo along the Z axis, the fourth - for the transformation of stretching, the fifth - for the rotation around the Z axis. The sixth, seventh and eighth operators contain arbitrary functions f (t), h (t), С (t), depending on time, and determine the infinite part of the algebra of the permissible operators. For the first time, a group analysis of the equations of the Navier-Khoks system was carried out in [5] V.O. Household. The difference between its result from the received operators (2) is that in (2) there are no two rotation operators on the X, Y axes, and an endless operator on the Z axis, similar to X6, X7, is presented in the form of two end -solo operators X2, X3. For example, the solution of equations (1) is built on operators <x3, x4> from the basis (2). We look for an invariant solution in the form: (u, v, w, q) = (u (x, t); y t +v (x, t); z t +w (x, t); q (x, t)), Where u, v, w, q are the desired functions of two variables. This leads to the UT +UUX +Uux = νuxx, VT +UVX +1 T V = νVXX, WT +UWX +1 T W = νWXX, UX +2 T = 0. (3), taking into account the factor. kinematic and dynamic conditions on g, the exact solution of the system was obtained (1): u (x, t) = h1 (t) - 2x t, v (x, y, t) = 1 t [y +α (xt 2 - ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ t 2h1 (t) d t)+β], w (x, z, t) = 1 t [z+ε (xt 2 - ∫ t 2h1 (t) d t)+µ], q (x, t) = 2xh1 (t) t −xh′1 (t) - 3x2 t 2 +h2 (t), p ∣∣ γ = −gη (x, y, t) +q (x, y, t) = −g [tφ ( J1, j2) −εj1 –µ]+ 2xh1 (t) t −xh′1 (t) - 3x2 t 2+ h2 (t), pa = p ∣∣ γ+ ν t [1+ √ 9+ t 4 ( α2 +ε2)] +2σh, where H1 (t), h2 (t), φ (J1, J2) - arbitrary functions; α, β, ε, µ - constants, j1 = xt 2 - ∫ t 2h1 (t) d t, j2 = 1 t (y +αj1 +β). 160 "Lobachev readings - 2019" Literature 1.
