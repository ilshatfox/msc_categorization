Chernyshevsky in the present work studies the equality of decays in the trigonometer rows of Fourier and on his own and attached functions (S.P.F.) of the integral operator, whose core will steer the jumps on the sides of the square inscribed in a single square. Keywords: equalness, resolvent, characteristic numbers, own and attached functions. Consider the integral operator: y = a f = 1 0 a (x, t) f (t) d t. (1) We denote: a1 (x, t) = a (x, t), if {0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2 - x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2}, a2 (x, t) = a (x , t), if {1/2+x ≤ t ≤ 1, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2}, a3 (x, t) = a (x, t), if {0 ≤ t ≤ - 1/2+ x, 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1}, a4 (x, t) = a (x, t), if {3/2 - x ≤ t ≤ 1, 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1}, a5 (x, t) = a (x, t), if {1/2 - x ≤ t ≤ 1/2+x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2} and {−1/2+x ≤ t ≤ 3/2 - x , 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1}. We will assume that ∂ k + l ∂xk∂t l ai (x, t), (i = 1, ..., 5) are continuous in their own stuck, (k + l ≤ 2, and if k + l = 2, then k = l = 1); ∂ ∂x ai (x, t), (i = 1, ..., 5) continuously differentiated in their areas, and A5 (X, 1 2 —X +0) - A1 (X, 12 −X −0) = a, a5 (x, 1 2 +x −0) - a2 (x, 12 +x +0) = b, a5 (x, −12 +x +0) - a3 (x, −12 +x −0 ) = C, A5 (X, 3 2 - X −0) - A4 (X, 32 —X +0) = D, where A, B, C, D are constant. The nucleus a (x, t) can be jumps on the sides of a square inscribed in a single square. In the space of the vector -function, the operator is Z = b g = ˆ 1 2 0 b (x, t) g (t) d t, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 2, (2) where z (x) = (z1 (x), z2 (x), z3 (x), z4 (x)) t, g (x) = (g1 (x), g2 (x), g3 (x), g4 (x)) t, 206 materials of the international school- Conferences b (x, t) =   0 a (x, 12 - t) a (x, 12 + t) 0 a (12 −x, t) 0 0 a (12 −x, 1– t ) A (12 +x, t) 0 0 a (12 +x, 1– t) 0 a (1 - x, 12 - t) a (1 - x, 12 +t) 0  . In [1] it is proved that (1) is equivalent (2). Theorem 1. For the operator B -1, the performance is true: B - 1z (x) = p z ′ (x)+a1 (x) z (0)+a2 (x) z (1/2)+a3 (x) z (x)+ ˆ 1 2 0 a (x, t) z (t) d t, (3) sz (0)+ tz (1/2)+ ˆ 1 2 0 a (t) z (t) d t = 0 . (4) where AI (x), I = 1.3, a ′ 3 (x), a (x) - continuous matrices - functions, each component of the matrix A (x, t) has the same nature of smoothness as The components of BX (X, T), S, T are a none of the constant matrices of the order of 4 × 4. The operator A resolve is located: if the rλ exists, then rison f = v (x), where v (x) = z1 (x) for x ∈ [0.1/2], and v (x) = z3 (x) = z3 (x) x - 1 2) for x ∈ [1/2.1], (5) where Z1, Z3 is the first and the first components of the vector Z (x) that satisfies the system (3), (4). The reverse statement is also proved: theorem 3. If λtakovo, that the homogeneous regional task for (3), (4)) has a zero solution, then Rλ exists and is determined by the formula (5). Consider the W ′ (x) = λDW (x)+m (x), u (w) = 0, (6) where m (x) arbitrary vector-function with components from L [0, 12]. If you delete all its own values ​​of the marginal task (6), together with the circular surroundings of the same small radius Δ, then in the resulting area Sδ to solve the system (6) w = r1λm proves the estimates: ∥r1λm∥urb = o (∥m∥ 1), ∥r1λm∥א = o (ψ (λ) ∥m∥و), ∥r1λm∥1 = o (ψ (λ) ∥m∥1), ∥∥r1λχ∥∥א = O (1λ), where ∥ · ∥ least, ∥ · ∥1 - the norms in the space of the functions vector Linger (0, 12), L (0, 12), χ (x) - vector function in which each component has a characteristic function of some segment contained in [0, 12], ψ (λ) = ∑4j = 1å (∣∣reλω j ∣∣), å (y) = 1 - e --y with y ≥ 0 (RET denotes the actual part of the complex number t). P.A. Kotov 207 The main result is the equal theorem: theorem 4. Let the A -1, the core A (X, T) satisfies the conditions described above. Then in sδ for any f (x) ∈ L [0.1] lim r → ger (f, x) - 4∑ j = 1 γ1 j’s ∣∣ω j ∣∣ (onic j, x) ∥ [ε [ε. , 12–ε] = 0, lim r → φ∥sr (f, x) - 4∑ j = 1 γ3 j’s ∣∣ω j ∣∣ (onic j, x - 1 2) ∥ [12+ε, 1-- ε] = 0, where SR (F, X) is a partial amount of the Fourier series, according to S.P.F. operator A for those characteristic numbers λK for which | λk | <r, σr (f, x) - a partial amount of the trigonometric series Fourier for [0, 12] according to the system {e4kπi x} for those k for which | 4kπ | <r, γi j (δi j) the components of a certain constant matrix γ (γ - 1), onic j (x) = δ j 1 f (x)+Δ j 2 f (1 2 −x)+δ j 3 f ( 1 2 +x) +Δ j 4 f (1 --x).
