. The method of decomposition of the region on the basis of fictitious components for the Poisson equation 1 R. Z. Dautov, A. V. Lapin, S. Yu. Fedotov Kazan State University, Kazan in the work proposes a new iterative method of solving the system of merebral equations, an approximating linear elliptical equation second order. The construction and study of the method is carried out on the example of a homogeneous task of a conductor for the Poisson equation. The essence of the proposed method consists in combining the method of decomposition of the region (see, e.g., [1]) and the method of fictitious components [2] - [4]. Computational experiments confirm the high efficiency of the proposed method, in particular, the practical independence of its mesh speed and advantage compared to some well -known iteration methods based on decomposition of the region. The justification of the convergence of the method was carried out for the case of the end-striped approximation of the considered differential task in the rectangular area. The 1st work was carried out with the financial support of the RFFI, project No. 04-0100484 107 The method of decomposition of the region based on fictitious components. . . 1 Differential task and its initial suitable approximation in the limited polygonal region ω R2 with the border ∂ω = ω̄ \ ω consider the differential task - △ u = f (x), x ∈ ω, u (x) = 0, x ∈ ∂ω . (1.1) Let v = h10 (ω) - the space of the Sobolev functions from L2 (ω) having generalized first -order derivatives and equal to zero on ∂ω. Then the task (1.1) has the following variation formulation: u ∈ V: ∫ ω ∇U ∇V dx = ∫ ω fv dx ∀v ∈ (1.2) it is known that this task has the only solution for any right part F ∈ L2 (Ω). We approximate (1.2) diagram of the method of finite elements (see, e.g., [5]). Let VH ⊂ V - the space of linear triangular finite elements, built on regular triangulation of the areas ω̄, and the endless task of uh ∈ VH: a (uh, v) = (f, v) ∀v ∈ VH (1.3) is approximation (1.2) . The broken γh, consisting of the sides of the triangles of triangulation Th, break ω into two single -linking bonds ω1 and ω2 (in Fig. 1, the net nodes in these areas are marked by icons (• °), respectively; the nodes on γH are assigned to the set with the icon (• )). We will numb independently nodes from 1 to N1 in ω1 ∪ γH and from 1 to N2 in ω2. Let ∗j (x) - the function from the base of the lagrange to VH, corresponding to the node xj, j = 1 ,. . . , N1 + + N2. If xj = x 1 i ∈ ω1 ∪ γ γ γ γh, then ∗j (x) we will denote ng (x). Accordingly, ∗j (x) = onic 2 i (x) for xj ∈ ω2. Then the arbitrary function VH ∈ VH will have a representation VH (x) = n1∑ i = 1 v1i 8 (x) + n2∑ i = 1 v2i accord (x) = v1h (x) + v2h (x). 108 R. Z. Dautov, A. V. Lapin, S. Yu. Fedotov ω 1 ω 2 γ H Fig. 1: Decomposition and triangulation of the region ω note that v2h ≡ 0 in ω̄1 (i.e. and on γh), v1h = 0 in ω̄2, with the exception of the area of ​​measures O (h) formed by the elements of triangulation lying in ω2, and having the side of belonging to γh. The arbitrary function VH ∈ VH is put in a mutually unambiguous correspondence of the vector-chistor of nodal parameters according to the decomposition according to the basis: v1h ⇔ (V11,., V1N1), v2h ⇔ (v21, v2n2), vh ⇔ v = (v1 (v1 , v2). Further, through 〈·, ·〉 we will denote the Euclidean scalar work in an arbitrary RK (the lengths of the vectors will be clear from the context). We have a (uh, vh) = a (u1h, v1h) + a (u1h, v2h) + a (u2h, v1h) + + a (u2h, v2h) = 〈a11u1, v1〉 + 〈a12u1, v2〉 + + + + + + + + + + + + 〈A21u2, v1〉 + 〈a22u2, v2〉 = 〈a0u, v〉, where AXZ matrices have elements AIJ = A (∗ x J, ∗ z i), (1.4) for z, x = 1, 2, a0 = (a1111 A12 A21 A22). 109 Method for decomposition of the region based on fictitious components. . . Similarly, we determine the vector of the right parts: (F, VH) = (F, V1H + V2H) = 〈F, V〉, F = (F1 F2). As a result, the task (1.3) is brought to the system of linear algebraic equations A0U = F, or (A11 A12 A21 A22) (U1 U2) = (F1 F2). (1.5) It is obvious that the matrix A11 dimensions N1 × N1 and A22 Dimensions N2 × N2 are symmetrical and positively determined, the matrix A12 dimensions N1 × N2 is equal (A21) t. In general, A0 is a symmetrical and positively defined matrix, and the system (1.5) is unambiguously resolved. 2 An expanded system of algebraic equations we introduce a new triangulation t 1 h to ω2 so that on γh Uzes are preserved the same (in Fig. 2 the internal nodes of the new triangulation are marked by the icon (⋄), their total number N3). Let γ h ω 2 Fig. 2: Additional triangulation of the region ω2 v 3h ⊂ {v ∈ H1 (ω2): V = 0 on ∂ω2 \ γH} - linear space 110 R. Z. Dautov, A. V. Lapin, S. Yu. Fedotov triangular finite elements on triangulation t 1h, ∗ 3 i (x) - the base of the lagrange in v 3h. Then the arbitrary function VH ∈ V 3H will have a representation VH (x) = ∑ x1 i ∈γH v1i accord 1 i (x) + n3∑ i = 1 v3i accord (x) = v1h (x) + v3h (x). (2.1) Note that v3h ∈ H10 (ω2). Further, we will assume that the V3H is continued by zero in ω1, so that many functions of the type (2.1) determine the new approximation of the space H10 (ω). We denote it through ® v 3 h.
