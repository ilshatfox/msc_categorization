The orthogonal vector field that does not possess the carrier in (1] is introduced by the carrier of the orthogonal vector of the field and proved that any ultralabo-Ishbo continuous vector field has a medium. It remained open in the light of the existence of an orthogonal vector field not about the bearer. Here. An example of such a field is given. For x = (x 1, x2, ...), E l 00 we determine the operator x, acting in the Hilbert space L2 according to the formula ~! - (Â· LFL 212) x -: x, x, .. ., f = (11, f 2, ...) E l2. Then M = {x: x e 100} - switching algebra von Neym on, and many of its orth projectors MRI = {x. ,, 7g with n }. N Let, further, MO = {I: lih. ,,.,, (1GI) -breakdown n}, Oppe I = L divide FO: MO -. L2 equality FO (x) = lio ~, where ~ where ~ =/. On a fixed vector from L2, and I 0 is unambiguously determined by the condition of 1GIO e U (here and - some ULTERFILRA, long -lasting filter Freche). Continuing by continuity FO with J \, 10 for m, we get a claim OMEM ORTOGONAL VETOR FILLE. Literature 1. Lugovaya G. D.
