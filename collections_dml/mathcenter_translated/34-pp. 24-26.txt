. The non -stationary task of group persecution A. S. Bannikov Udmurt State University, Izhevsk in the space of RN (N> 2) The differential game γ ν +µ persons: ν pursuers P1 ,. . . , Pν and µ otching E1 ,. . . , Eµ. The laws of the movement of each of the pursuit of the PI and each of the escaping EJ have the form ẋi = a (t) xi + ui, ẏj = a (t) yj + vj, ui, vj ∈ V, where xi, yj, ui, vj ∈ Rn , i = 1 ,. . . , ν, j = 1 ,. . . , µ, a (t) - continuous square matrix of order n, v - convex compact. Definition. In the differential game γ from the initial state z0 = (x01,., X 0 ν, y 0 1,., Y 0 µ) Office is possible if there are measurable functions V1 (t) ,. . . , vµ (t), vj (t) ∈ V for all j, t> 0, such that with any measurable functions U1 (t) ,. . . , uν (t), ui (t) ∈ V for all I, t> 0 there is number S in which the inequalities XI (t) 6 = ys (t) for all I = 1 ,. . . , ν, t> 0. At the same time, we think. that at the time t> 0 the management of the escapers are formed on the basis of the z (t) = (t), (xi (t), yj (t)), and the management of the pursuers on the basis of any conceivable information. 26 Let g ⊂ rn, g 6 = ∅. We denote the border g, x = (x1,., Xν), y = (y1,., Yµ), XI, yj ∈ Rn, I (x, g) = {I | XI ∈ G}, J (Y, G) = {J | yj ∈ G}, and if there are indexes jl ∈ J (y (t), ∂g), l = 1 ,. . . , s, s> 1, j1 <j2 <. . . <js, such that yj1 (t) = yj2 (t) =. . . = yjs (t), then we believe JL /∈ J (y (t), ∂g) for l = 2 ,. . . , s. Denote through | i (x (0), rn \ g) |, | j (y (0), ∂g) | The number of sets of sets I (x (0), rn \ g), j (y (0), ∂g), and through ψj (t) - the solution of the conjugated system ̇̇ = −a ∗ (t) ψ, corresponding to the initial condition ψj (0) = Pj, where Pj is a uniform support vector to the multiple G at the boundary point y0j, j ∈ J (y (0), ∂g). Theorem 1. If there is such a convex compact g that | j (y (0), ∂g) | > | I (x (0), rn \ g) | and for any j ∈ J (y (0), ∂g) the supporting function C (v, ψj) is differentiated by ψj along the trajectory ψj (t) of the conjugated signs For almost all t> 0, then in the differential game γ with the initial state of Z0 there is evasion. Theorem 2. If there are convex compacts G1, G2, such that x 0 i ∈ G1 ∪ G2 for any I, v is strictly a corn compact with a smooth border, and | I (x (0), G1 \ G2) | <| J (y (0), rn \ (g1 ∪g2)) | + | J (y (0), ∂g2) |, then in the differential game γ with the initial state of Z0 there is evasion of the meeting. 27 l and t e r a t r a 1. Chicriy A.A. Conflict-controlled processes. - Ki Ev: Sciences. Dumka, 1992. - 240 p. We will consider about one non -puncture task for a hyperbolic equation with an integral condition of N. V. Bayin Samara University, for_natatsar@mail.ru for the UTT (X, T) - uxx (x, t) + c (x, t. ) = 0 (1) in the area d = {(x, t): 0 <x <l, 0 <t <t} with the initial data of the cat u (x, 0) = onic (x), ut (x, ut (x, 0) = ψ (x) (2) and non -cauldal conditions of the type ∫ l 0 ki (x) u (x, t) dx = 0, i = 1, 2, (3) where the functions ki (x), onic (x ), φ (x) set. Studies of non -collar tasks with integral conditions have shown that even in the simplest cases, the system of its own functions is not full in L2, but in some cases it is possible to build a basis that stands from its own and attached functions. In the work, the conditions on the functions of Ki (X) were found, during which the task in L2 (0, L) has a rice basis, consisting of its own and attached functions. 28
