Topology of the space of the sums of rows of random quantities measurable relative to the sequence of independent σ-algebr. The case of σ-algebr, generated by the breakdown of the three sets of P. Yu. Lazarev Kazan State University, Pavel.lazarev@ksu.ru Let there be a probabilistic space (ω, a, p) and the subsequent of independent σ-landscap A1, A2 ,. . . , Ai,. . . (i ∈ N), where each σ-podalgebra AI is generated by the division of three equally conventional sets A1i, A 2 I, A 3 I. Consider many all kinds of amounts of ∑ives ∑ et I = 1 ₽, where each hole is measurable relatively σ-algebra AI (such random values ​​will continue to be called “triple”). This is a linear subspace of many random values, denote it through B3. The object of the study is the topology that induces at this subspace topology of the ambulance on the faith. Lemma. If a row ∑µ i = 1 ₽ converges p. From lemma it follows that the amount of the row lies in any LP for P> 1 and the series converges in LP. In particular, b3 ∈ L2, and many final sums of triple random values ​​everywhere tightly in B3 both in the topology L 2 and in the topology of convergence according to probability (see Theorem 3.1 c [1]). Theorem. Topologies induced on B3 from L2 and convergence by probability coincide. 150 l and t e rn a 1. Vahandia N.N., Taryladze V.I., Chobanyan S.A.

Laptev Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, A.Lapteva@ntek.nnov.ru Consider the triangulated closed n-dimensional multiplot p, groups of its syplucial chains CI (P), CEC CLOSE (P) and HIMOLOGY HI (P) with fields from the field Z2, I = 0, 1,. . . , n. Let it: hk (p) × hn --k (p) → z2 - intersection index. Definition. Bases [xk1] ,. . . , [x k r] Gomology group HK (p) and [z n -k 1] ,. . . , [z n -k r] Homologies group HN -K (p), k ∈ {0 ,. . . , n}, are called dual if ind ([xki], [z n --k j]) = {1 for i = j, 0 in all other cases. Consider the non -negative weight function L: C1 (p) → R. The method of solving the following problem is proposed. Let [zn -11] ,. . . , [z n - 1 r] - the basis of the HMMology group HN -1 (P). It is necessary to find one -dimensional cycles X11 ,. . . , x 1 r, homologous classes of which form the basis of the group H1 (P), the dual base [zn -11] ,. . . , [z n - 1 r], while for all k = 1 ,. . . , R X1k cycle has the minimum weight of L (x 1 k) in its homologation class. 151
