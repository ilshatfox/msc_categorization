With the consistency of the shuiski, the main stratification of GS (BN-M) is associated, the base of which is the congruent, and the standard layer of 32 S-member stationarity GS (S = N2-PT + M.2 + + p + m) plane lm. Ass. Owigated stratification contains a collapse of projective reperns with the same base, a typical layer of which is a bonno1YUGO, the LM p1 is shut. ), and the projective group GP (n) acts in PN. In associated stratification, it will be worried about group connectivity, which is set according to Lapteva using the field of the object g = {gg, g [, ~, gaf>., G!

It is shown that the object of curvature of the group of coherence is pseudothensor. qi11. It is proven that it induces two in group connectedness in association: V1 stratification.
