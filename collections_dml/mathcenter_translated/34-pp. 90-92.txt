The movements of the gyroscopic systems Yu. V. Ershov Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, eryv@yandex.ru Let (b, h)-Rimanovo diversity, F and U-corresponded to a closed 2-form and smooth function on B. Four γ = (b, h, f, u) Call a natural mechanical system with gyroscopic forces or, in short, gyroscopy system. At the same time, B is a configuration diverse system of the system, h/2 - the form of kinetic energy, f - the form of gyroscopic forces, U - potential energy. The bench press is that the function U is positive, and the form F has before the staging f = θφ, where θ ∈ R and φ is a closed 2-form, the integrals of which are integrally smooth in all two-dimensional smooth spheres. If the integral from the form φ at least one two -dimensional spheroid of diversity B 92 is different from zero, then the functionality of the action of the system γ is much mean. In the work [1], the variational task with fixed ends for the multi -valued functionality of the γ system is reduced to the study of geodetic Rimanov variety, which was spread over the configuration variety B. Using this reduction, in particular, it was possible to obtain conditions for the γ, point A and B diversity B and homotopic class D connecting a and b paths, during which there is a family of the Extremas belonging to the parameter E, which takes almost any in advance for this value from the interval (α0, β0), where √ 2α0 is an exact lower face of the lengths ways from D, and β0 < +φ [1]. Definition. Let (m, g)-complete rimanovo a variety of eating, hk (ω (m)) 6 = 0 for some k ∈ N. The function of the HK state on a variety of M will call the display DK: m × m → R specified by the formula DK (v , w) = inf - The carrier of the singular cycle. The main properties of the functions of the HK state are listed in [2]. We select and fix the support path XD ∈ D. For each path x ∈ D, we denote through CX a piece-and-loud homotopy that connects the paths X and XD. The symbol KR (D) denot the many critical values ​​of the functionality of LD: D → R Rimanov variety (b, h), and the symbol K (D, L) - many geodetic stems from D of the length l ∈ Kr (D). With the help of the functions of the HK state, the existence of an endless sequence of parametively non-overturning spaces parametriling the families belonging to 93 D movements of the system γ. Namely, the theorem is proved. Let a, b ∈ B, d ∈ π0 (ω (b, a, b)) and for any l ∈ Kr (d) is true inequality {∫ cx φ + z | x ∈ K (d, l)} 6 = R /Z. Then there are sequences of the actual sections of the villages {αn} n∈N ∗ and {βn} n∈N ∗ with the properties: 1. αn 6 βn <αn+1 for all n ∈ N ∗; 2. αn, βn → +∞; 3. Each number n ∈ N ∗ corresponds to the couch counum (δ, x) ∈ R × D, such as Δ 6 = 0, X - the Extremal of the functionality of Sδ and δ 2U (x) + H (dx/ds, dx/ds )/2 ∈ [αn, βn]. L and T R A T R A 1.
