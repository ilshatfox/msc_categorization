. Orthogonal networks on the hyperpolos of the conformal space A.I. Mikhailova Chuvash State Pedagogical University named after AND I. Yakovleva, Cheboksary E -Mail: maalinan@chuvsu.ru The work considers the hyperpolosa in the actual conform space S. (m <p - 1). Affin struts, moped by normal equipment, are applied to the study of the internal geometry of the orthonal networks of LM, specified on the NT strip hyper. It is proved that the field of harmonic (p - t) -spheres [.f;] Orthonal network LM internally determines the normal equipment of the GI with a pumolose n t. If the orthogonal network L t s n t ting is a certain Normal equipping of the submissiveness of the Chebishevskaya in] 2 connectedness V Mi V, then it is geodetic regarding both of their connectedness; At the same time, this equipment coincides with the equipment of hyperpolosa n t. The harmonic (p - t) - sphere (.f; j 103 Literature 1. BAZILSV V.T. On networks on multidimensional surfaces of the projectivio of the space // Izv. Universities.
