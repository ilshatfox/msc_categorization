UDC 517.54 The criterion for the existence of single -leafing displays for polygonal areas with special unlimited rotation of E.N. Khasanova1, P.L. Shabalin2 1 Enkarabasheva@bk.ru; Kazan State Architectural and Construction University 2 Pavel.shabalin@mail.ru; The Kazan State Architectural and Civil Engineering University we studied the one-leafness of the conformal display of the upper half-fluidity with a fixed set of prototypes of the vertices for the polygonal region of a special type with an infinite number of vertices and received a criterion for the existence of single-leafing display. Keywords: conformal display, single-leaf, single-leaf displays, the Christoffs-Shvartz integral, polygonal regions. 154 Materials of the Youth School-Conference denote a single-cycle polygonal obstruction, which can be multi-leafed. The border lz = ∂dz consists of two broken ones: L1z and L2Z with a total starting point A0 (0.0). The broken L1Z and L 2 Z have an infinite number of rectilinear links. The peaks of L1z are the points A1, A2 ,. . ., numbered sequentially from A0, the vertices of L2Z - points A -1, A -2 ,. . . When the boundary of the region is bypassed from point A0 along the broken L1z, the region remains on the left, and along L 2 Z is on the right. The angles, the form of the actual axis and links A0, A1 and A0, A -1 are considered specified, without restriction of community, we consider 0 ≤ η10π <2π, 0 <η20π --η10π <π/2. Also, we consider known the corners internal in relation to the DZ area at the vertices of AK and A -K, which are denoted byαkπyα -kπ, moreover, 0 <αk <1, 1 <α–k <2, k = 1, urb. The internal angle of DZ for the polygonal region at the top A0 is equal to the difference (η20 –η10) π. We will consider the conformal display Z (ζ) the upper half -fluidity with two fixed monotonous sequences of the points {tk} ger k = 1, tk> 0, and {t --k} icle = 1, t -k <0, on the polygonal region of the specified type . When displayed z (ζ) points tk, t - k are prototypes of the vertices of AK and A -K, respectively, Z (0) = 0. Additionally, we will require the fulfillment of the conditions φ∑ k = 1 1 tk <mm, φ∑ k = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | t --k | <Imes. (1) Introducing the functions of the functions n ∗ - (perf) n ∗ - (perf) =   0, 0 <ctor <–T -1, k∑ j = 1 κ - j, –T -K <ctor <–T -k - 1, and by analogy n ∗+(₽), where κK = 1–αk, κ --k = α --k −1, k = 1, urb, for positive constant ∆, α, α, α, α, C We demand the execution of the following restrictions | n ∗+(₽) −∆ lnαă | <C, | n ∗ - (perf) −∆ lnαă | <C. (2) To display the upper half -fluidity of E+ to the polygonal region with the end number of vertices in the case when the values ​​of the corners are set with unknown peaks, the prototypes of these vertices on the material axis are set and these parameters satisfy the conditions (1), (2), in our work, in our work in our work. [1] The formula Z (ζ) = a0 ζ∫ 0 eiη 1 0π ζ1 - (η 2 0–η10) ∏icles ∏ et K = 1 (1– ζT -K) κ --k ∏imes K = 1 (1– ζtk ) κK dζ. (3) This formula summarizes the Christoffel integral - Shvartz in case of a polygonal region with an infinite number of peaks. The result of a study of the issue of one -leafness in the class of display with fixed sequences of the points {tk} ger k = 1, {tk} ger k = 1, satisfying conditions (1), (2), and the structural formula (3) is the following theorem. In order for the display in the class of display (3), under conditions (1), (2), one -leafy is necessary and enough to be performed, inequality 0 ≤α≤ 1. P.L. Shabalin, A.Kh.
