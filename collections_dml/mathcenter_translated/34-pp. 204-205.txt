. Asymptotic spectrum and trace formulas for one operator R. Z. Tulkubaev Bashkir State University, Ufa, rinattulkubaev@pochta.ru in the space L2 [0, π] Operator L = t + v, where tf = n∑ k = 1 k (f, ∈) ising, ∗ = √ 2 π cos kx, and v is the multiplication operator on a supply function V (x). Note that T is a square to the Ren from the operator LF = −F ′, generated by the conditions of the Neumann F ′ (0) = F ′ (π) = 0. The spectrum of the operator T consists of numbers k = 0, 1, 2,. . . . The corresponding complete orthonomated 206 sequence of its own functions consists of the functions onic (x), where ∗0 (x) ≡ 1/ √ π. We study the spectrum of the indignant operator L. since for all Z 6 = K (k = 0, 1, 2,.) Operator (L -z) −1V is the operator of Gilbert -shmidt, then V is compact relative to T, and the spectrum L semi -border and discrete. About the numbers of the spectrum L in a non -spent order and taking into account the brief: λ0 6 λ1 6. . . The following statements are fair. Theorem 1. Let V (X) ∈ L2 [0, π]. Then at k � 1 λk = k + c0 + αk, where αk → 0 for k → ∞, c0 = 2π ∫ π 0 v (x) dx. Theorem 2. Let V (X) ∈W 21 [0, π]. Then φ∑ k = 0 [k + (v ∗, onic) - λk] = 1 2π ∫ π 0 v 2 (x) dx - c20 2, where the row is absolutely converged. Theorem 3. In the conditions of theorem 2, the equality is equality φ∑ k = 0 [k + c0 - λk] = 1 2π ∫ π 0 v 2 (x) dx - c 2 0 2 + c0 2 - v (0) + v (π (π ) 4, where the row converges absolutely. Note that theorem 3 summarizes the formula received by her in work [1]. L and T R A T R A 1. Murtazin H.Kh., Fazullin Z.Yu. On the formulas of traces for non -nuclear disturbances // Dokl.
