Teplitsev operators in the spaces of analytical functions in the polycounten with a mixed norm Introduction, let it = {z = (z1,., Zn): | zi | , I = 1, N}-a single polycryg in the N-dimensional integrated space CN, P = (P1,., PN), 0 <pi <α = (α1,., αn), αj> −1, j = 1, n. We denote the functions measuring through LP (α), for which ‖f‖lp (α) =  ∫ ∫ u (1 - | ζn |) αn · · ·   ∫ u (1 - | ζ2) α2   ∫ u | f (ζ1,., Ζn) | P1 × 302 × (1- | ζ1 |) α1 dm2 (ζ1)) P2/P1 DM2 (ζ2)) P3/P2 · · DM2 (ζn) ) 1/pn <inous, where U = U1, DM2 (ζ) is a 2-dimensional measure of the Lebey on U. The subspace LP (α), consisting of holomorphic functions, is denoted by AP (α). The greenhouse with the symbol H is called the integral operator th (f) (z) = 1 (2πi) n ∫ t n f (ζ) h (ζ) ζ - z dζ, and, as usual, 1 ζ - z = n∏ j = 1 1 ζj - zj, ζ = (ζ1,., Ζn) ∈ T N, Z = (Z1,., Zn) ∈ Un. These operators have numerous applications in many areas of the theory of functions and functional analysis, they play a significant role in the study of factorization issues, in the study of ideals in algebra of analytical functions, in the study of metric projections, etc. (see [1] - [3]). We describe those characters H in which the operators Th (F) (Z) act in the spaces AP (α), p = (P1,., PN), 0 <pj 6 1, j = 1, n. Naturally, we are considering these operators first on the whole dense subspace of Horry (un) AP (α) space. In the case of weight anisotropic spaces of the holomorphic in un functions, a similar result was previously obtained in work [4]. To formulate the main result, we introduce additional designations. Consider the operators of the dβ, where β = (β1,., Βn), βj> −1, j = 1, n. Let G - holomorphic in un function, G (Z1,., Zn) = +ger∑ K1, ..., KN = 0 AK1, ..., KNZ K1 1. . . z kn n, put dβg (z) = + φ∑ | k | = 0 n∏ j = 1 γ (αj + 1 + kj) γ (αj + 1) γ (kj + 1) akz k. It is clear that the Dβg function will also be holomorphic in un, and d0g = g. Through λp (α) we denote the set of all holomorphic functions G, for which ∣∣dβ+1g (z) ∣∣ 6 c n∏ i = 1 (1- | zj |) −βj -2+(αj+2 is executed )/pj, 303 where βj> (αj + 2)/pj, j = 1, n, z = (z1,., zn) ∈ Un, C - const. In the space λp (α), a norm is naturally introduced, relative to which the λp (α) space turns into a banakhovo. Let's say that the function of the RP class summarized on T N belongs to the Fourier coefficients of the functions H are zero outside the Zn+ ∪ ( - zn+). We formulate the main result. Theorem 1. Let p = (p1,., Pn), 0 <pj 6 1, j = 1, n, h ∈ Rp. Then the following statements are equivalent: 1) TH (F) acts in AP (α); 2) the function H is presented in the form of h = h1 + h2, where h1 ∈ Hipp (un), h2 ∈ λp (α). §one. The wording and proof of auxiliary statements let SJ be a whole non -negative number, LJ is an integer that satisfies the condition of −2SJ 6 LJ 6 2SJ - 1, J = 1, N. Denote ∆sj, lj = {zj: 1 - 2 - SJ 6 | zj | <1 - 2-SJ -1; 2–SJπLJ 6 Arg ZJ <2 --SJπ (lj + 1)}, ∆s, l = ∆s1, l1 ×. . . × ∆sn, ln. Let further ζ = (ζ1,., Ζn), z = (z1,., Zn) ∈ Un, put EZ = n∏ j = 1 1 1– ζ̄JZJ. In case of proof of theorem 1, the following facts of Lemma 1 will be used [5]. Let V ∈ C (un), and for any polydisk unρ (W) = {Z = (Z1,., ZN): | WJ - ZJ | <ρ, j = 1, n} ⊂ un, w = (W1,., WN) ∈ Un, inequality is performed | V (W) | 6 A∣∣unρ (W) ∣∣ ∫ unρ (W) | V (ζ) | DM2N (ζ). Then there is an estimate +ger∑ S1, ..., SN = 0 2S1-1∑ L1 = −2S1 · · · 2SN - 1∑ ln = −2sn {max ζorn, ..., sn, l1, ..., ln | v (ζ) | (| ∆s1, l1 | α1/2 · · · · · · · | ∆sn, ln | αn/2) | ∆s, l |} 6 c (a) ∫ un | v (ζ) | (1 - | ζ |) α DM2N (ζ). Here A is a positive number, depending only on V, C (A) - constant, α = (α1,., Αn). 304 Lemma 2 [5]. Let 1 <p < +inous and βj> αj, j = 1, n. Then the operator tα (f) (z) = ∫ un f (ζ) (1- | ζ |) α (1- ζ̄z) β+2 dm2n (ζ), z = (z1,., Zn) ∈ U n displays LP (α1,., αn) into the space AP (ωα1,., ωαn), and ‖tα (f) ‖ap (ωα1, ..., ωαn) 6 c (p, α) ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖) F‖LP (α1, ..., αn). Here ωαj (t) def = (t) αj (tβj/tαj) p, t ∈ (0, 1), J = 1, N, C (P, α) - constant. Theorem a [6]. Let p = (p1,., Pn), where 0 <pj 6 1, α = (α1,., Αn), j = 1, n, g (z) = φ (ez), z ∈ Un. Then, if φ is a linear continuous functionality on AP (α), then g ∈ λP (α); The functionality φ is present in the form of φ (f) = lim ρ → 1–0 1 (2π) n ∫ t n f (ρζ) g (ρζ̄) dm2n (ζ), (1) there are positive constants C1, C2, such as that c1 ‖g‖λp (α) 6 ‖φ‖ 6 c2 ‖g‖λp (α). (2) back, any function g ∈ λP (α) gives rise to linear continuous functionality on the AP (α), for which the assessment is true (2). Theorem B [7]. If f ∈ AP (γ), 1 6 p < + φ, γ> −1, then F admits the integral representation f (z) = γ + 1 π ∫ u (1 - | ζ | 2) γ (1– ζ̄z) γ+2f (ζ) dm2 (ζ). Lemma 3.
