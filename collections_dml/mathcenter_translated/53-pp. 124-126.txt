The Taylor formula for the task of the approximate hidden of the circumference of the circumference the purpose of the work is to generalize the Huygens formula from [1, p. 261] for the approximate hidden of the arc of a circle, small in comparison with the radius, in case of an arbitrary number of n chord. Let S = RX - the length of the arc is circled radius R, corresponding to the central corner of the X radian; DK = 2R sin (2 –KX) - chords corresponding to the central u lamp 21–kx, 1 6 k 6 n. Consider the task of representing S = RX by the approximate formula of the type S ≈ n∑ k = 1 akdk (1) with indefinite AK coefficients, 1 6 K 6 N. Using the Taylor formula (macloren) for the function f (x) = sinx S.K. Paymerov, A.V. Semenova, D. E. Sokolova 125 with a residual member in the form of Lagrange, we get: rx ≈ 2r n∑ k = 1 ak sin x 2k = 2r n∑ k = 1 ak (x 2k - 1 3! (X 2k) 3 + 3 + ..++ (−1) n -1 (2n - 1)! (X 2K) 2N - 1+ (−1) nθk (2n+ 1)! (X 2K) 2N+ 1); 0 <θk <1, 1 6 k 6 n. Collecting the coefficients with the same degrees X and subsequently multiplying by 2 (2J-1) n, 1 6 j 6 n, we will write down the system of no non -algebraic equations relative to unknown AK, 1 6 k 6 n: n∑ k = 1 2n -kak = 2 n - 1; n∑ k = 1 2 (2j - 1) (n - k) ak = 0, 2 6 j 6 n. Using [2] the desired values ​​were found: a1 = (−1) n+1 (22 - 1) (24 - 1). . . (22N–2 - 1); AK = (−1) n+k2k2−1 (22 - 1) (24 - 1). . . (22k−2 - 1) · (22 - 1) (24 - 1). . .

Lomonosov modeling of an adaptive regulator for electric power systems The main element of the electricity generation system is an electric generator. The prevailing role is played by electromechanical induction generators of alternating current. Such generators have relatively about standing device and allow you to generate large currents with a sufficiently high voltage. The function of ensuring the operating ability of the energy system is assigned to automatic regulation systems that support the acceptable for so far the quality of electricity quality both in normal and in AVA Riyn (non -standard) modes. Currently, within the framework of SI Stream control, fuzzy are widespread
