Materials of the International School-Conference UDC 517.538.52+517.538.53+517.518.84 On the properties of polynomials of the Hermita-Pad of the exponential functions of A.P. Starovoitov1, E.P. KECHKO2 1 svoitov@gsu.by; Gomel State University named after Francis Skorina 2 ekechko@gmail.com; The Gomel State University named after Francis Skorina in the work studies extreme properties and localization of zeros of the non -iagonal polynomials of the Hermit-Pad 1st kind for the exhibiting system {eλp z} kp = 0 with arbitrary various complex numbers λ0, λ1 ,. . . , λk. The above theorems complement and summarize the known results of K. Malera, E. Suff and R. Vargie, G. Stal, P. Borvein, F. Vilonsky and K. Driver. Keywords: the polynomials of the Hermit - the Pad, the zeros of the polynomials of the Hermit - the Pad, asymptotic equalities. For a given natural number k, we consider an arbitrary fixed set {λp} kp = 0 of various complex and arbitrary set {np} k p = 0 entires of living numbers. Epiphany and pave the 1st kind of systems of exponential functions {eλp z} kp = 0 are called polynomial a p np, de np é np-1, p = 0.1, ..., k, at least one of which identically not equal to zero, satisfying the condition RN0, n1, ..., nk (z) = k∑ p = 0 a p np (z) e λp z = o (zn0+n1+...+nk - 1), z → 0. (1) polynomials {apnp (z)} k p = 0 (at n0 = n1 = ... = nk, they are called diagonal polynomials of the Ermite-a case of the 1st kind) are introduced into consideration by an ermit [1] in connection with a study of the arithmetic properties of the number E. If we do not take into account one -dimensional case when we are dealing with well -studied classical polynomials of the case (see [2]), then we can say that to date, the properties of non -iagonal polynomials have been studied to a much lesser extent (see [3], [3], [3], [3], [3], [3], [3], [3], [3]. 4]) than diagonal. This is partly due to the fact that the methods previously used in the study of diagonal polynomials and the approximations of Ermite - Pad are not so effective in the general situation. For example, Laplace and Pass methods (the method of the saddle point) are quite detailed to find the asymptotic of integrals depending on one parameter N. However, in a general situation, one has to deal with integrals depending on K +1 different parameters N0, N1, ..., NK. Polynomas A0N0 (Z), A 1 N1 (Z), ..., A K NK (Z) that satisfy equalities (1) can be obtained by the solution of the linear system N0+N1+...+NK −1 of homogeneous equations from N0 +N1 +... +NK by unknown coefficients. Therefore, a non -trivial solution always exists. It is easy to show that such non -trivial solutions can be discharged in explicitly. Indeed, let the CP be the border of the circle at the λp point of such a small radius that all the rest λ j lie in the appearance of this circle, and the curse is the border of the circle with the center at zero of such a large radius that all the numbers λ j, A.p . Starovoitov, E.P. Kechko 341 j = 0.1.2, ..., k belongs to its insides. Using the Cossack theorem about deductions, it is easy to show that the functions a p np (z) = e --λp z 2πi ˆ cp e oring d ă ∏k p = 0 (ising --λp) np, 0 é p é k, (2) rn0 , n1, ..., nk (z) = 1 2πi ˆ cippa e oring d Answers С = 0 (₽ --λp) NP (3) satisfy (1) and all other conditions. Equality (2) and (3) are not new. For the first time they appeared in the works of Ermit. Next, we will consider the normalized function obtained by the division of the residual function RN0, N1, ..., NK (Z) to the senior coefficient of the polynomial A K NK (Z). To find its numerical value, we will produce nk −1 times equality (2) for p = k. As a result, we obtain that the value of the senior coefficient AKNK (Z) coincides with the value of the integral 1 2πi (nk −1)! ˆ ck d ă (₽ --λk) ∏k -1 p = 0 (₽ --λp) np, which is calculated according to the integral formula of the cat, and equal∏k - 1 p = 0 (λk λp) −np /(nk - one)! . We will show that normalized and transformed accordingly polynomials {apnp (z)} k p = 0 are the solution to the following extreme task: for a fixed set of real numbers λ0 <λ1 <... <λk, to find polynomial a p np (z), de np é NP, p = 0.1, ..., k, with the senior coefficient of the AKNK (Z) polynomial, which implement the minimum in the next equality EN0, N1, ..., NK = EN0, ..., NK (λ0, λ1, ..., λk; ρ): = min {a p np (z)} k p = 0 ∥∥∥∥∥ k∑ p = 0 a p np (z) e λp z ∥∥∥∥∥ ρ, where ∥ h∥ρ = max {| h (z) | : z ∈ Dρ}, dρ = {z: | z | É ρ} ⊂c, and ρ is a fixed positive number of the smaller π/(λk –λ0). We formulate the main results. Theorem 1. Let λ0 <λ1 <... <λk - an arbitrary fixed sequence of real numbers, and ρ <π/(λk −0). Then, ifmin {n0, n1, ..., nk} → → → → → then en0, n1, ..., nk ∼ nk! ∏k -1 p = 0 (λk λλp) np +1 (n0 +n1 +... +nk +k)! ρn0+n1+...+nk+k. Theorem 2. Let {λp} kp = 0 - an arbitrary fixed set of various complex numbers. Then, with min {n0, n1, ..., nk} → least evenly in z rn0, n1, ..., nk (z) ∼ zn0+n1+...+nk - 1 (n0+n1+.. .+NK −1)!
