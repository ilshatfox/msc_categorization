We denote the polynomial extensions of the invariant algebra through a [x1, ..., xn] algebra of the polynomes above a certain algebra A from the Committing Unknown X1, ... , Xn. They say that algebra B is a polynomial expansion of algebra A (A C B), if B = A (b1 ".., b1, ..., BN E.S. Let K (G) - category of uniform algebra on compact, The connected trial group G. Algebra A K (G) is called: Polynomically closed, if it does not have non -trivial polynomial explosions in the category K (G). Let the additive group G isomorphic group Group G, and S - some underput group in g in g. , containing a single element and generating the gem group S is called A.L. Gobrai, which is called from the condition of PA S, and E G, N E N, the theorem. If algebrai is closed, then it is closed, then Algebra of all continuous functions for G, the spectrum of which is contained in s, is Jav1. L. L. am an amplified A.L. Gubra. Literature 1.
