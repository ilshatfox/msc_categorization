. Affin functions in the spaces of incompatible curvature according to Buzeman A.V. Galkin Pomeranian State University named after MV Lomonosov, G. Arkhangelsk in the article [1] determined the afferent displays of geodetic metric spaces and the question has been raised what metric spaces allow non -trivial affection functions. In particular, there are affected functions on non -standard metric works of geodetic metric spaces (see definition in [2]). Determination 1. We will say that the set of A in the metric space X is broken into a trivial metric stratification a = b × m C, if 1) topology A coincides with the topology of the work B × C; 2) All the many species b × {c} are isometric, and the projections are b × c → b × {c} are isometers on the layers. 37 3) All many species {b} × c are isometric, and the projections are b × c → {b} × c are isometers on the layers. Determination 2. Geodetic a, b in the space of incompatible curvature according to Buzeman are parallel if the distance of Hausdorf between them is of course: HD (A, B) <imes. Geodesic A: R → X is called regular if in both its directions it serves as a line of the anti -Gradient for the only accuracy to the Orifunction Constant. Theorem 1. Let x - local compact space of incompatible curvature according to Buzeman, a: r → x - regular geodetic in X. Then many points belonging to geodetic, parallel a is split into trivial metric stratification of the type Y × mr, where y ⊂ x - x - The closed convex set in X, obtained by the intersection of the orisfer with the centers at infinitely removed points A (+urb) and A (− least). Theorem 2. The spaceship X allows a non -trivial affin function F: x → R in that and only if it is split into the trivial metric stratification of the geodetic metric space y = f -1 (0) into the material direct R.
