Singular integral equation in a special case N.Yu. Zonova1, I.G. Salekhova2 1 nina-zonova@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Mechanical and Mathematics Institute 2 Jlysia.salekhova@ksu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Mechanical and Mathematics Institute, a characteristic singular integral equation was decided when the contour is the combination of the counting number of periodically located segments, as well as in the case of the counting set of segments periodically located in the right half-plate. The solution to the problem was obtained by information to the corresponding problem of Riman. Keywords: integral equation, the task of Riemann, one -periods of segments, a one -period function, a whole function, a middle function. The message is devoted to the solution of the characteristic singular integral equation 154 materials of the international school-conference aular (t)+ b πi ˆ l ther (τ) dτ τ (τ-t) = f (t), (1) where a, b is const; a, b ∈C. In the first part, the equation (1) is considered provided that L = φ⋃ k = − least LK, where l0 = (A0, B0) lies in the vertical strip 0 <rez ≤ 2π, and are obtained from L0 transformations of the single -period group Z + 2πk, k ∈ Z. Function f (t) ∈ Hλ (l̄0), f (t) = f (t +2π), t ∈ L̄0. It is required to find the function onic (t) ∈ H (BK), which satisfies the condition onic (t) = eed (t + 2π), t ∈ L̄0. Class H (BK) is understood as a class of functions, gelderic outside the ends of the ends of AK, BK arcs LK and limited at points BK, K ∈ Z. The set task is equivalent to the solution of the equation aular (t)+ b 2πi ˆ l0 onic (τ) (ctg τ - t 2 —Ctgτ 2) dτ = f (t) (2) in the class of periodic functions gment ∈ H (b0) . The only solution to the equation (2) has the form: onic (t) = [a2 −b2] f (t) - [b a2 −b2] χ+ b (t) 2πi ˆ l0 f (τ) dτ χ+ b (τ ) [ctg τ - t 2 —Ctgτ 2] dτ, where χb (z) = (sin b0 --z2 sin a0 - Z2 sin b0 2) α+ iβ - [α], α+ iason = lng0 2πi, G0 = A −b A +B, [α] - a whole part of the number α. The decision was also obtained in classes H (A0), H0, H (A0, B0). In particular, in class H0, the solution of equation (2) has the form ffic (t) = [a2 −b2] f (t) - [b a2 −b2] χ+0 (t) 2πi ˆ l0 f (τ) dτ χ +0 (τ) [ctg τ - t 2 - ctgτ 2] dτ + 2b (a - b) ψ (t) χ + 0 (t), where ψ (z) = c1 (ei z −1), χ0 ( z) = χb (z) 1 ei z –ei b0, c1 = const. The second part considers the solution of equation (1) in the case when f (t) ∈ Hλ (L̄), SUP t] | f (t) | ≤ m <inous. It is required to find the function onic (t) ∈ H (BK), which satisfies the condition SUP t Photo | onic (t) | ≤ m1 <inous. (3) N.Yu. Zonova, I.G. Salekhova 155 In this case, the desired function is not periodic, so the approach used in the tasks used in the tasks for the counting many contours is applied. The only solution to the equation (1) in the class h (bk) has the form onic (t) = [a2 −b2] f (t) - [b a2 −b2] χ+ b (t) πi و μ = −mm ˆ LK T F (τ) dτ χ+ b (τ) τ (τ - t) The solution was also obtained in classes H (AK), H0, H (AK, BK). The third part is devoted to the solution to equation (1), provided that L = ger⋃ k = 0 lk, where L0 = (A0, B0) lies in the vertical strip 0 ≤ Rez <1, a lk are obtained from L0 transformations Z +K, K, K, K, K, K, K, K, K, K, K, K, K, K, K, K ∈ N, and the function f (t) satisfies the conditions f (t) ∈ Hλ (l̄), f (φ) = 0. Function gment (t) satisfies the condition (3). Unlike the peridic arrangement of the intervals in this case, the canonical function of the corresponding equivalent task of Riemann is non -periodic. However, due to the given pattern of the location of the intervals and constant coefficients, it is possible to investigate the behavior of the canonical function, which is expressed using Euler's gamma function. The solution of equation (1) was obtained in classes H (BK), H0, H (AK, BK). In particular, the only solution to the equation in the class h (bk) has the form onic (t) = [a2 −b2] f (t) - [b a −b] χ+ b (t) πi ipp∑ k = 0 ˆ lk t f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f F (τ) dτ (a + b) χ + b (τ) τ (τ - t), where χb (z) = [γ (b0) γ (a0 - z) γ (a0) γ (b0 - z)]] (α+iβ) - [α] literature 1.
