. Search for the minimum path in a given class of relative homologies of 85 A. V. Lapteva Nizhny Novgorod State University, A.Lapteva@ntek.nnov.ru in a triangulated closed variety of dinsic n Consider the popopolihedral q and the peak of u that does not lie in q. Symbols CK (P) and HK (P) We denote groups of symlucial circuits and homologies with coefficients from the Z2 field, and symbols ZK (p, u ∪q) and hk (p, u ∪q) are similar groups of relative cycles and homologies, k = 0, 1,. . . , n. For a chain C ∈ CK (p), we believe C̄ = C + CK (U ∪Q). Let x ∈ C1 (p) and ∂x = {u, v}, where v ∈ Q. The task of finding the chain z ∈ C1 (p) that satisfies the conditions is solved: (1) u ∈ ∂z ⊂ u ∪q; (2) [z̄] = [x̄] in hk (p, u ∪q); (3) l (z) ≤ l (y) for all ȳ ∈ [x̄]. We put R = Rank H1 (P) and V̂ = V × ZR2, where V are many vertices of the Simpleic complex K (P). The key idea of ​​the proposed method is the use of an abstract Simpleic complex K̂ with many V̂ vertices, which can be interpreted as a complex of some polyhedra P̂, covering P with a group of monodrome H1 (P). The general scheme for solving the problem is as follows. 1. First there are cycles Y1 ,. . . , YR, the homological class of which form the basis of the HN -1 (P) group. 2. Then such homomorphism j: c1 (p) → zr2 is built, which for arbitrary y ∈ Z1 (p) and i ∈ {1,. . . , r} coordinate J I (y) of the vector j (y) ∈ Zr2 is an intersection index of cycles y and yi. 86 3. Further, all ways Y ∈ C1 (q) are considered with the beginning of v ∈ ∂y and many ŝ ⊂ v̂ from the peaks (v ′, j (x) + j (y)) are built, where v ′ = ∂y \ { v}. 4. At the final stage, the shortest path is calculated ẑ ∈ C1 (p̂) from the top (u, 0) ∈ V̂ to the set ŝ. The projection of z paths ẑ is the desired way of minimal length. To find the basis of the HN -1 group (p) in step 1, you can use the well -known algorithm from [1]. The method of constructing index function J developed in [2]. L and T R A T R A 1.
