UDC 519.642 On one splash method of solving integrated equations of the third kind N.S. Gabbasov1 1 gabbasovnazim@rambler.ru; The Naberezhnye Chelninsky Institute of the Kazan (Volga) Federal University studies a linear integral equation of the third kind with a coefficient having zero -order zeros. For its approximate solution in the space of generalized functions, a special generalized variant of the Plainmetod is proposed and justified. Optimality has been established in order of accuracy of the constructed method. Keywords: integral equation of the third kind, close solution, splain-method. The object of the study is the linear integral equation of the third kind (Utr) (AX) (t) ≡ x (t) q∏ j = 1 (t - t j) m j + 1∫ −1 k (t, s) x (s) d s = y (t), (1) in which t ∈ I ≡ [−1,1], t j ∈ (−1,1), m j ∈N (j = 1, q); K and Y are well -known continuous functions that have certain properties of the "smoothness" of a point nature, and X is the desired function. The study of such equations is undoubtedly of 92 materials of the school-conference of both from the point of view of theory and applications (see, e.g., [1,2] and bibliography to them). Especially relevant is the development of effective methods of their approximate solution with the corresponding theoretical justification. The main results in this direction are presented in monographs [2], in which special direct polynomial and splasen (based on the 1st and 2nd orders) methods for solving Utre (1) in various spaces of generalized functions are proposed and substantiated. This work is devoted to the approximate solution of the Utre (1) in a certain space V generalized functions generated by the functionality “The final part of the integral by Adamaru”. It is, for this purpose, a new version of the generalized collection method is proposed, based on the use of cubic minimal defect. A theoretical justification was carried out in the sense and it was established that the developed method is optimal in order of accuracy in some class F of smooth functions among all direct projection methods of solving the studied equations in the space of generalized functions. Let y ≡ c {m; τ} ≡ c {m} τ (i)-the space of “point-hot” functions, and t: y → c-“characteristic” class Y (see, e.g., [2, [2, [2, [2, [2, [2, [2, [2, [2 p. 22]), where m ≡ (m1, m2, ..., mq) and τ ≡ (t1, t2, ..., tq) are the final sets of values ​​that appear in the equation (1). In this main space Y, we introduce the family x ≡ v {m; τ} of the generalized functions of X (t) type X (t) ≡ z (t)+ q∑ j = 1 m j - 1∑ = 0 γ j i p.f. (t - t j) −i - 1, where t ∈ I, z ∈ C, γ j i ∈ R are arbitrary constant, and P.F. (t - t j) −i - 1 - generalized functions defined on Y according to the following rule: (P.F. (T - t j) −i - 1, y) ≡ p.F. ∫ 1 −1 y (t) (t - t j) −i - 1d t (y ∈ Y, i = 0, m j −1, j = 1, q) (the sign P.F. indicates the final part of the integral according to Adamaru). According to the relevant norms, Y and X will be banal. Next, let it be specified by Utre (1), in which the continuous initial data K and Y satisfy the following requirements: k ∈C {m} τ (i 2); onic J I (s) ≡ k {i} t (t j, s), ψ j i (t) ≡ k {i} s (t j), y ∈ Y (i = 1, m j −1, j = 1, q), (2) a x ∈ X - the desired generalized function. Its approximate solution is formed in the form of xn ≡ xn (t; {ck}) ≡ n+1∑ i = −1 ci bi (t)+q∑ j = 1 m j --1∑ i = 0 ci+n+2+m+m+m+m+m (j-1) (t-t j) −i-1, (3) where BI (t) is the usual B-linen of the third order on a uniform grid from the node of the MI SK ≡ ≡ −1+ 2k/n (k = 0, n ), a m (l) ≡ l∑ i = 1 mi (l = 0.1, ..., q), m (0) ≡ 0, m (q) ≡ µ. Set {ck} n+µ+1 −1 of unknown parameters we will find, according to our method, from SLAU (tρn) = 0 (i = 0, n), ρ {i} n (t j) = 0 (i = 0 0, m j −1, j = 1, q), N.S. Gabbasov 93 (TUXN) (3) (S J −0) = (TUXN) (3) (S J +0) = 0 (J = 1, N −1), (4) where ρn (t) ≡ (Axn - Y ) (t) - an unhappy of an approximate solution, and u: x → y - an operator generated by the first component in the Utr (1). For the computing algorithm (1)-(4) the theorem 1. Let k eer a = {θ} in x and the functions k (according to t), tsk (by t), ψ j i (i = 0, m j −1, j = 1, q), y ∈ Y c (r) ≡ {y ∈ Y | T Y ∈ C (R)} (R = 1.3). Then, with all n ∈ N (n ≥ n0), the Slau (4) has the only solution {c ∗ k} and the sequence of approximate solutions x ∗ n ≡ xn (t; {c ∗ k}) converges to the exact solution x ∗ = a - 1y according to the norm of space x at a speed of ∥x ∗ n −x ∗ ∥ = o (n - r) (r = 1.3). Following the work [3, p. 40], through VN (F) we denote the optimal assessment of the error of all kinds of direct projection methods of solving equation (1) on a certain class F. Theorem 2. If f = y c (r), then vn (f) ≍ n --r (n = n +µ +3, r = 1.3), where ≍ means weak equivalence, and this optimal order realizes the method (3 ), (4). Literature
