The use of integral formulas when finding the distribution of temperature in the task of sudden heating of the surface of the heterogeneous semi -space V.B. Bednov1 1 msu.mmf.vb@gmail.com; Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov The article provides a method for solving the temperature problem of the sudden heating of the surface of the heterogeneous in the depths of the semi -space. Integral formulas are used, which allow you to express the solution of the original problem for the equation with variable coefficients depending on coordinates and time, through the solution of the same problem for the equation with constant coefficients. Key words: thermal conductivity, equations in private derivatives with variable coefficients, integral formulas. The non -stationary one -dimensional task of thermal conductivity about the sudden heating (T ≥ 0) of the heterogeneous semi -space x ≥ 0 at the border x = 0 is considered that the temperature conditions have the form θ (0, t) = θ0h (t); θ (x, 0) = 0, (1) where θ (x, t) is a deviation of the temperature from the initial value θ0 = const, h (t) - a single function of the head of the head. Together with the initial task (similar to the work [1], [2]), the concomitant task is considered about the sudden heating of the surface of a homogeneous semi -space with the same initial and boundary conditions. The deviation of the temperature in the concomitant task is denoted by ψ (x, t). For the initial task, similarly [2], the integral formula θ (x, t) = ψ (x, t)+ t∫ 0 l∫ 0 ∂g (x, hole, t − λ) ∂ă (λ0 λλ (ă, (₽, τ) ∂∂ (₽, τ) ∂ Answers) dival + + t∫ 0 l∫ 0 g (x, ₽, t −for) (c 0ε –cε (ă, τ) ̇̇ (ă, τ) dvditionτ, where g (x, ₽, t −τ) is the function of the Green of the original task (book [3], [4]). Further, the solution of the initial problem is presented in the form of a series of all kinds of derivatives from solving the concomitant problem (in the assumption that the solution of the concomitant problem is infinitely differentiated and is laid out into a series of Taylor in the vicinity of the point (x, t)): θ (x, t) = φ∑ p +q = 0 n (p) (q) i1 ... iq (x) ∂pψ, i1 ... iq ∂t p, p = 0.1,2, ...; Q = 0.1.2, .... 52 Materials of the School conference functions n (p) (q) i1 ... IQ (x) with p + q> 0-continuous coordinate functions, which are informed moments of the functions of Green and its derivatives. The upper and lower indices in round brackets mean the procedure for the derivative of time and coordinate, respectively. With negative P or Q, structural (according to work [2]) functions N are identical to zero, n (0) (0) = 1. Facial representation in the form of a number of solving the initial problem in the thermal conductivity equation, we obtain recurrent equations for structural functions: P +q = 1: (λ11n (0) (1) i1, x +λ1i1), x = 0, (λ11n (1) (1), x), x —cε = —c 0ε; p +q = 2: (λ11n (0) (2) i1i2, x +λ1i2 n (0) (1) i1), x +λi21n (0) (1) i1, x +λi2i1 = λ 0 i2i1, (λ11n (1) (1) i1, x +λ1i1 n (1) (0)), x +cεn (1) (0), x +cεn (0) (1) i1 = 0, (λ11n (2) (0) (0) (0 ), x), x −cεn (1) (0) −ρ = −ρ 0; p +q ≥ 3: (λ11n (p +q) (q) i1 ... iq, x +λ1iq n (p +q) (q - 1) i1 ... iq - 1), x +λiq 1n ( p+q) (q - 1) i1 ... iq - 1, x++λiq iq - 1 n (p+q) (q - 2) i1 ... iq - 2 —cεn (p+q - 1) (Q) I1 ... IQ −ρn (p+q - 2) (q) I1 ... IQ = 0. In the case of a one -dimensional task of thermal conductivity, recurrent equations become ordinary differential, the solutions of which are quite easy to find. For example, with p +q = 1, we get n (0) (1) i1 (x) = x∫ 0 λ --111 (ζ) (1 〈λ - 111〉 λ λ --1111i1〉〉 λ1i1 (ζ) dζ, dζ, dζ, N (1) (1) (x) = x∫ 0 λ - 111 (ζ) ζ∫ 0 (cε (ζ̂) −c 0ε) d ζ̂dζ - x∫ 0 λ --111 dζ 1 〈λ - 111〉 λ λ λ λ λ λ −111 ζ∫ 0 (cε (ζ̂) −c 0ε) d ζ̂〉. Considering that the solution of the concomitant problem (a special case of the Danilovskaya problem, work [5], [6]) has the typeψ (x, t) = θ0 ERFC (x1p 4åt), we can find the approximate solution of the problem with the desired accuracy.
