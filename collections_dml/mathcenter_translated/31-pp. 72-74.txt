. An example of an ecbphin display of T.V. Zudin Volzhsky branch of the Moscow Road Institute (State Technical University), ZTV77@mail.ru 1. Let there be two N-dimensional diversity m and m̄ with ecc byphic sl (n, r) structures ( ∇, ω) and (∇̄, ω̄), respectively, each of which consists of coherence without twisting and not converting to zero covariantly constant in this connectedness of the N-form (see [1]). Then diphenomorphism f: m → m̄ is called an exiyffin display if the n-form f ∗ (ω̄) belongs to SL (n, r)-the structure of diversity m, i.e., f ∗ (ω̄) = cω for the constant C> 0. The last As it is easy to establish, it is performed only when and only when the tensor de 72 of the formation t = ∇̄- ∇ ∇ in connectivity ∇̄ satisfies the condition tracet = 0. 2. We build an example of an ecbphin display. To do this, we will introduce the variety (m̃, g) into the consideration of the pseudorimanovo with the coherence of the Levi -Chivit ∇̃, conformally dipho -nomorphic Pseudorimanov diversity (M, G) with the coherence of Levi -Chivita∇. The metric teaser G̃ of such a variety is determined from the equality of G̃ = E2σG for some kind of smooth function σ specified in the variety (M, G). At the same time, the tensor of deformation t̃ = ∇̃ - ∇ in the common to conformal diphoralorphism f̃: m → m̃ coordinate X1 ,. . . XN has components (see [2], p. 112–116) t̃ kij = γ̃ k ij - γkij = σiδkj + σjδki - σkgij (1) for the symbols of Christophyle γ̃kij Rimanov diversity (m̃, g), σj = ∂jσ circle and σk = gkjσj. We set the projective display f̄: (m̃, g̃) → (m̄, ḡ) a variety of variety (m̃, G̃) on pseudorimano diversity (m̄, ḡ). This is possible and only when only equalities are performed in the general display f̄ ° system (see [2], p. 161–166) t̄ kij = γ̄ k ij - γ̃kij = ψiδkj + ψjδki (2) for components of the tensor Deformations t̄ = ∇̄ - ∇̃ and ψj = 1 n + 1 ∂j ln √∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ det ḡ det g̃ ∣∣∣∣. Since in this case G̃ = E2σg, ψj = 1 n + 1 (∂j ln √∣∣∣∣ det ḡ det g ∣∣∣∣ - nσj). 73 taking into account (1) equality (2) can be rewritten in the form: γ̄kij - γkij = (σi + ψi) Δkj + (σj ​​+ ψj) Δki - σkgij. (3) And therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is trace t = 0 of the existence of an ecbphin display f: (m, g) → (m̄, ḡ) is presented in the form of differential equations: nσj +(n +1) ψj = 0 for an unknown function σ. The general solution has the form σ = 1 n2 ln √∣∣∣∣ det ḡ det g ∣∣∣∣ + const. (4) Theorem. The composition f = f̄ ° conformal f̃: (m, g) → (m̃, g̃) and projective f̄: (m̃, g) → (m̄, ḡ) dipheromorphisms is an exyaffin display f: (m, g) → (m̄, ḡ) Pseudorimanov diversity (m, g) on ​​the pseudorimano diversity (m̄, ḡ), if the metric of diversity (m̃, g̃) is determined by the equality of G̃ = e2σg for σ type (4). In this case, N-forms are forms of volumes ω = √ | DET G | DX1 ∧. . . ∧ dxn ω̄ = √ | Det ḡ | dx̄1 ∧. . . ∧ dx̄n of these diversity. The opposite is true. L and T R and T R A 1.
