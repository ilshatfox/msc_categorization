. . . An economical diverse scheme for non -stationary movement of viscous, weakly planted gas 1 K.A. Zhukov, A.V. Popov Moscow State University. M.V. Lomonosov, Moscow built an implicit diverse scheme with a splitting operator for a linear system of equations that describes the non -stationary movement of the viscous, weakly luxury gas in the case of two spatial variables. The use of the splitting operator made it possible to advance the algorithm for the search for a variety solution in the obvious vi de method Fourier. The results of the numerical scales are given that showed the effectiveness of this method compared to an implicit scheme, the solution of which was searched for by iteity methods of conjugated gradients. 1 The initial-pore task we consider the linear system of equations that describes the non-stationary movement of the viscous weak-luminous barotropic gas: ∂p ∂t + k div (u) = 0, ∂u ∂t + ∇p = µ∆u + f. (1.1) The desired values ​​- pressure P and speed vector U = (U1, U2) - are the functions of Eler's variables (t, x) ∈ [0, T] × ω. Above through µ indicates the dynamic viscosity coefficient, which is considered a well -known positive constant. The equation includes function F (vector of external forces), which is a well -known function of Euler's variables. A positive constant characterizes the compressibility of gas [2, 3] is indicated through K. Below we will assume that K> 1. 1 work was carried out with the support of the RFFIF, project No. 02-01-00490, and RAS, the program "Modern problems in theoretical mathematics" 120 K.A. Zhukov, A.V. Popov supplement the system (1.1) with the initial and boundary conditions (p, u) | t = 0 = (p0, u0), x ∈ ω, u (t, x) = 0, (t, x) ∈ [0, t] × ∂ω. (1.2) below we will assume that there is the only solution to the problem (1.1) - (1.2). Tasks similar to the tasks (1.1) - (1.2) were considered in the works [4,6]. In these monographs, implicit diverse schemes of variable directions were built. In the proposed work, a new economical diverse scheme with a splitting operator was built, the effectiveness of which is confirmed by numerical experiments. 2 Designations and auxiliary statements, let ω = [0, l1] × [0, l2], hx = l1/m1, hy = l2/m2. Then ω1 = {(ihx, jhy): 0 6 i 6 m1, 0 6 j 6 m2}, ω2 = {((I + 1/2) HX, (J + 1/2) HY): 0 6 i 6 m1 - 1, 0 6 j 6 m2 - 1}. Through ω1 and ∂ω1, we denote the many internal and boundaries of the grid ω1, respectively. Let U H-a linear about the wanderings of the vector-function v = (u, v), determined on ω1 and turning to zero on ∂ω1, and P H-the space of functions defined on ω2. We introduce scales into the u h and pH by formulas (V1, V2) u = m1-1∑ i = 1 m2−1∑ j = 1 u 1j i u 2j i hxhy + m1-1∑ i = 1 m2-1 j = 1 V 1j i v 2j i Hxhy, (p, q) p = m1-1∑ i = 0 m2–1∑ j = 0 p j i q j i hxhy. Now we determine the operators of the variable differentiation ∂̃12x, ∂̃ 12 y, acting from ω1 to ω2 according to the rule (∂̃12x u) j+1/2 i+1/2 = 1 2 (uji+1 - u j i hx+u j+1 I+1 - u j+1 i hx), 121 Economical variable scheme. . . (∂̃12y v) J+1/2 i+1/2 = 1 2 (VJ+1I - V J I Hy+V J+1 i+1 - V J i+1 Hy), ∀ i = 0 ,. . . , M1 - 1, j = 0 ,. . . , M2 - 1. and similarly ∂̃21x, ∂̃ 21 y: ω2 → ω1, (∂̃21x q) j i = 1 2  q j+1/2 i+1/2 - qj+1/2 i -1-1 /2 HX+Q J - 1/2 I+1/2 - qj - 1/2 i -1/2 Hx  , (∂̃21y q) J I = 1 2  q J+1/2 i+1/ 2 - QJ -1/2 I+1/2 Hy+Q J+1/2 I -1/2 - QJ -1/2 I -1/2 Hy  , ∀ i = 1,. . . , M1 - 1, j = 1 ,. . . , M2 - 1. For certain operators, equality are true (∂̃12x u, q) p = - (∂̃ 21 x q, u) u, (∂̃ 12 y v, q) p = - (∂̃ 21 y q, v) u , (2.1) ∀ v ∈ UH, Q ∈ P H, which can be easily checked directly. We introduce the designations for the divergence and gradient used below: d̃iv h v = ∂̃12x u+ ∂̃ 12 y v, ∇̃hq = {∂̃21x q, ∂̃ 21 y q}, which have the following property: (d̃iv h v, q) = - ( ∇̃HQ, v) ∀ v ∈ UH, Q ∈ P H, 3 DIFFERENT SCHEMENT in the works [2] and [3] for the numerical solution of the problem (1.1) - (1.2) it was proposed to use the variable scheme Qt + K d̃iv h v̂ = 0, vt + ∇̃hq̂ = µ strongv̂ + f̂. (3.1) 122 K.A. Zhukov, A.V. Popov here further denote v = vn, v̂ = vn+1, vt = (v̂ - v)/τ, where n = 0, 1,. . . , N (nτ = t). The initial and boundary conditions for the scheme (3.1) are set by equations (q, v) | n = 0 = (p0, u0), v | ∂ωu h × ωτ = 0. (3.2) by energy inequalities in [2, 3] proven estimates for a numerical solution received according to the scheme (3.1) - (3.2). To search for a variety solution on the upper layer, various iterative processes designed for saddle tasks can be used [5]. A classic algorithm is considered to be the udzava method. It is as follows. We express from the second equation (3.1) v̂ and substitute the resulting expression in the first equation: (e - τ2k d̃iv h (e - τµchn) −1∇̃h) q̂ = = –τ d̃iv h (e - τµ μ) −1 −1 (τ f̂ + v) + q, (3.3) v̂ = –τ (e - τµ °) −1∇̃hq̂ + (e - τµchn) −1 (τ f̂ + v). (3.4) Thus, the task is reduced to the consistent solution of equations (3.3) and (3.4). Denote F = τ D̃IV H (E - τµH) −1 (τ f̂ + v) + q, bh0 = (e - τ2k d̃iv h (e -
