We consider the linear time equation 6 (V f) (z) = f (z)+ l f [sk (z)] = g (z), z e r; g (z) = _g (-z), (1) k = l in the class in even functions f (z), holomorphic n plane with a cut according to L and disappear: I am at infinity. Let SK (z) converting the GRU1111Y, which display R to the polygon nicknames, having a common side or common vertex. Pre-caused.
