The diversity of the algebrian Lebens of the weak growth of S. P. P. Mishchenko, O. I. Cherevatenko Ulyanovsk State University, MishChenkosp@ulsu.ru; Ulyanovsk State Pedagogical University, Chai@pisem.net is a linear algebra is called algebra Leibniz if it is true (XY) Z = (XZ) Y + X (YZ), which is performed, for example, in any algebra Lee. The space of the PN (V) of degree N variety V is a module of the symmetrical group. Its character is laid out into an integer combination χn (v) = ∑ λ λ`n mλχλ preferred characters χ, corresponding to the breakdown λ = (λ1, λ2,.... The growth of the sequence of dimensions of the spaces PN (V) determines the growth of diversity V. Following [1], we will call the growth of diversity V weak, if for some natural n the condition CN (v) <2 [n -1 2] is fulfilled, where square brackets know the whole Part of the number. Theorem 1. Let V - the variety of weak growth over the field f, charf 6 = 2. Then there is such a number S that the identity is performed (x1x2) (x3x4) · · · (x2s+1x2s+2) ≡ 0. The proof is carried out similarly [ 1], only in the case of the algebrian Leibniz determined by Higgin (see [2]) ideals are only the right ideals of algebra, which creates additional difficulties. In the case of zero characteristics of the main field, using the results of work [3], we get 101 consequences. Let V - the diversity of the algebrus of the Libron of weak growth above the field of zero characteristics. Then the variety of V has polynomial growth. In particular, there are no varieties of algebrian Leibris of growth, intermediate between polynomial and indicative. Theorem 2. In the case of the zero characteristics of the main field, the variety of algebrus vnitsa V has polynomial growth and only when there is such a number m, that mλ = 0 if the condition is N - λ1> m.
