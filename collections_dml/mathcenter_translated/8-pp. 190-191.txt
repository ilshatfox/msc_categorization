The non -metro stationary marginal task of the type of Neumann for meta -analytical functions is+ - the final single -link area on the plane of the computer alks variable Z = X+ IY, limited by a simple smooth closed contour L. through T - denote the addition of T+ ∪L to a complete comprehensive plane. Everywhere in the future we will use the designations and terminology adopted in [1]. The following regional task is considered. It is required to find all the meta -analytical functions of the F+(Z) class m2 (t+) ∩ h (2) (L), which satisfy on the lredit condition ∂f+(t) ∂n+g (t) f+(t) = g (t), (1) where ∂/∂n is a derivative of the internal normal, and G (t), G (t) - specified on L functions H (L). With G (t) ≡ 0, the task (1) is the task of the Neumann in the class of meta -analytical functions. Therefore, with G (t) 6 = 0, t ∈ L, the formulated task will be called a modified task of the type of neuman for meta -analytical functions. Moreover, if G (t) ≡ 0, the task (1) is called homogeneous. The task of the Neumann (i.e., the task (1) for G (t) ≡ 0) in the class of meta -analytical functions is not neter, since meta -analytical in the circle t+ = {z: | z | <1} The functions F + (Z) = (Zn -1 + Z̄zn) Exp {λ0z̄}, where n is an arbitrary natural number, and λ0 - any complex number, are solutions to a homogeneous problem of Neumann 190 (1). Consequently, the number of a linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous problem of Neumann is not final, which means that the task of Neumann for the meta -analytical functions of not Neter. However, as will be established in this message, a modified task of the type of neuman for meta -analytical functions is neter. L and T R A 1. Rasulov K.M.M.
