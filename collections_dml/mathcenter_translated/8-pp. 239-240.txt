Square formulas for one -dimensional singular integrals, let Hω [0, 2π] - a class of continuous on [0, 2π] functions, the continuity module satisfies the inequality ω (f; Δ) ≤ ω (δ), 0 <Δ ≤ b - a, f. ∈ Hω [0, 2π], where ω (Δ) is a convex upward module. The syngular integral of the type j (f, s) = 2π∫ 0 f (τ) ctg τ - s 2 dτ; F ∈ HPU [0; 2π]. (1) Let x0 <x1 <x2 <. . . <xn - a given mesh of the nodes. We build trigonometric b-liners, which are characterized by the minimum of our carrier: b (x | x0,., Xn) = = sin ((x-x0)/2) b (x | x0,., XN-1) + sin ((xn - x)/2) b (x | x1,., xn) sin ((xn - x0)/2). Note that b (x | x0,., XN) are positive on (X0, XN), and outside it are zero. Using interpolation trigonometric splashes, the method of approximate calculation of the integral (1) jn (f; s) = n - 1∑ k = 0 f (xk) {ak (t) + bk (t) cos t + ck (t) sin t is built. }, (2) where {xk} - pair of non -excessive nodes, ak (t), bk (t), ck (t) - the coefficients of the quadrature formula. 239 Theorem 1. On the HRα class, the error of the quadrature formula (2) of the trigonometric spell-interpolation of the degree of at least R+1 has the order of n-r --α ln n. Theorem 2. The quadrature formula (2) based on interpolation trigonometric slices is optimal in order in the HRα class. L and T R A TARAELKHAEV B. G.

Shirokova (Kazan) The method of setting the reverse task of the theory of elasticity in accordance with the formulations of the main tasks of the flat theory of elasticity [1] and reverse regional tasks for analytical functions [2] set the task of finding the final area of ​​the elastic deformation according to the correspondence of the correspondence between its border by the correspondence vector of external efforts and a vector of displacements with the known length of the border arc. Mathematically, the task is reduced to finding the area D and the analytical functions F (Z) and G (Z) with specified integrated functions R1 (σ) and R2 (σ), 0 ≤ σ ≤ l, where l is the length of the boundary curve l = ∂ ∂ ∂ D, if [f (z) + zf ′ (z) + g (z)] | zatory = r1 (ω (s)), [κf (z) - zf ′ (z) - g (z)] | zatory = r2 (ω (s)), 240
