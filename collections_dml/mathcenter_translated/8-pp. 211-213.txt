The permissibility of the integral equation of the Voltairer in the space of asymptotically ω -periodic, as the functions of functions, the permissibility of the pair of spaces asymptotically ω - periodic as the functions for the equation x (t) = t∫ 0 k (t, s) x (s) ds + f (t. ), (1) where the core is K (t, s) is determined everywhere in the area –ura <s ≤ t <mm and satisfies the conditions [1]: 1. K (t + ω, s + ω) = k (t, s ) −urb <S ≤ t <mm; 211 2. With any T> 0 Matrix K (t, s) is summarized by s for [0, t] and lim h → 0 +  t∫ 0 ‖ (t + h, s) −k (t, s ) ‖ Ds + t + h∫ t ‖ (t + h, s) ‖ ds    = 0. Determination 1. Continuous and limited to [0, φ) function X (t) has a zero limit as the lean is µ with t → ° if for any number Δ> 0 the condition µ {t ≥ t: ‖x (t) ‖rn ≥ Δ} - → 0 for t → urb is performed. We use for this limit the designation lim t → φ x (t) µ = 0, and for the space of such functions - C̃0. Determination 2. Continuous on [0, φ) function x (t) is called asymptotically ω - periodic as it is, if x (t) = z (t) + y (t), where z (t + ω) = z (t ), y (t) ∈ C̃0. The space of all such functions is denoted by ãPω. The following statements are proven: theorem 1. Let the resolver R (t, s) equations (1) satisfies the conditions: 1) SUP THAM 0 ‖R (T, S) ‖ DS <imes, 2) the function ivil (t) = 0∫ −urb r (t, s) exp (i 2kπ ω s) ds, k = 0, 1 ,. . ., i = √ −1, continuous on [0, φ) and lim t → φ onic (t) µ = 0, 3) lim t → φ ω∫ 0 r (t, s) s µ = 0, 212 4) for any closed set F ⊂ [0, φ) of the final measure and any Δ> 0 there is such a T0 that depends on F and Δ that µ {t ≥ t0: ∫ f∩ [t0, t] ‖r (t, t, t, t, t] s) ‖ ds ≥ δ} <mm. Then the couple (ãpω, ãpω) is permissible for the equation (1). Comment. Conditions 1 - 3 of theorems are also necessary for the permissibility of the pair (ãPω, ãPω) regarding equalization (1). Theorem 2. Let the pair (ãpω, ãpω) is permissible for the opera of the torus (k̃x) (t) = t∫ 0 k (t, s) x (s) ds and ∃t0 ≥ 0 = ⇒ SUP Tural T0 ‖ T0 ‖ K (t, s) ‖ ds = γ <1. Then pair (ãpω, ãpω) is also permissible for the equation (1). L and T R A T R A 1. Pulyaev V.F., Tsalyuk Z. B.// Dif. Equations. - 1974. - T. X, No. 6. - S. 1103–1110. F.F.
