. Lyapunov's codes of controlled systems A.F. Gabdrakhimov Udmurt State University, Izhevsk, Gab@udm.ru Consider the linear controlled system of differentiation ẋ = A (t) x+b (t) u, x ∈ Rn, u ∈ Rm , t ∈ R, (1) where A (·), B (·) are limited pieces of subtable to R Effective matrix functions. Let the control in the system (1) are built in the form of u = u (t) x, where u: r → mm, n is a piece of limited matrix function. Then the system (1) passes into a homogeneous system ẋ = (a (t) +b (t) u (t)) x. (2) The task of Lyapunov's codes is the following: it is required for an arbitrary system of differential equations ẏ = c (t) y, y ∈ Rn, (3) with a line-into-term matrix C (t) to build U (t). , t ∈ R, so that the system (2) with this 42 control is asymptotically equivalent to the system (3) with a given matrix C (t). Let matrices A and B are stationary. Then (1), (2) they will go to ẋ = AX+Bu (4) ẋ = (A+Bu (t)) x. (5) Theorem. Let N <5 and the system (4) are quite controlled. Then, for any system (3) with a constant matrix c, control û (t), t ∈ R is found, in which the system (5) is asymptotically equivalent to a given system (3). In this case, the management û = û (t) will be (depending on the matrix C) either constant, or piece-to-stand, periodic with any pre-given period ϑ no more than 4 reaches on segments of length ϑ. Built management û = û (t) is “locally unit” relative to C in the following sense: ∀n> 0 ∃l = l (n): ∀c, | c | 6 N, management û (t), t ∈ R, will satisfy the inequality of SUP tgr | û (t) | 6 l.
