Materials of the International School-Conference UDC 519.642 Summarized Collocation method for one class of integrated equations of the second kind Z.Kh. Galimova1 1 zulshik@mail.ru; Kazan Innovation University named after V.G. Timiryasov (IEP), the Naberezhnye Chalny branch studied the linear integral equation of the second kind with motionless features in the nucleus. For its approximate solution, a generalized version of the collocation method is proposed and justified. Keywords: integral equation, close solution, collocation method, theoretical justification. The linear integral equation with motionless features (uno) in the nucleus is AX ≡ x (t)+ 1ˆ 0 k (t, s) - 1x (s) d S = y (t) (t ∈ J ≡ [ 0,1]), (1) where u (t) ≡ t p1 (1–t) p2 q∏ j = 1 (t - t j) m j; p1, p2 ∈R+, t j ∈ (0.1), m j ∈ N (j = 1, q); K and y are known continuous functions that have certain properties of the “smoothness” of a point nature, X is the desired function, and the integral is understood in the sense of the final part according to Adamar. On the basis of reasoning and results of work [1, 2], direct projection methods specially adapted to the solution of Uno (1) are established in the sense of [3, chap. In the form of illustration, we give only some results. Let x ≡c {p1, p2; m, τ} ≡c {p1, p2; m} (j) - vector space of functions represented in the form of g (t) ≡ (u · g) (t)+ q+ 2 ∑ j = 1 m j - 1∑ i = 0 a j i r J i (t), (2) where g ∈ G (j), g (t j) ≡ lim t → t j g (t) (j = 1, q +2 ), t j ∈ (0.1) (j = 1, q), tq+1 ≡ 0, tq+2 ≡ 1; a J i ∈ R, and R J I - fundamental polynomas of the ermit of the degree m - 1 by nodes {t j} q+2 1. Here M ≡ q+2∑ j = 1 m j, mq+1 ≡ λ1 +1, mq+2 ≡ λ2 +1, λ j ≡ λ (p j) (j = 1.2), λ (p) ≡ [p) ] - (1 + si g n ([p] - p)) ([·] - a whole part). We introduce a “characteristic” class of class X: (t g) (t) ≡ [g (t) - q+2∑ j = 1 m j - 1∑ i = 0 g {i} (t j) r i (t)] /] / u (t) (g ∈ X), where g {i} (t j) are the corresponding Taylor derivatives (see, e.g., [2]). It is clear that Z.Kh. Galimova 103 V (2) g = t g ∈C, A J I = G {I} (T J). According to the norm ∥g∥x ≡t g∥c + q + 2∑ j = 1 m j - 1∑ i = 0 | g {i} (t j) | Space X is full and invested in c. We will study the operator A in UNO (1), where the core K satisfies the conditions K ∈C {p1, p2; m} (j 2); onic j i (s) ≡ k {i} t (t j, s), ψ j i (t ) ≡ k {i} s (t, t j) ∈ X (i = 0, m j −1, j = 1, q +2). (3) Theorem 1. In conditions (3) Operator A: X → X Fredgolmov. The evidence scheme is as follows. The complete continuity of the operator K: X → X is preliminarily shown. Then the affirmation of the theorem directly follows from the fact that the indignation of the operator’s Neter is quite continuously preserves the weakness and does not change its index. Let the equation (1) in which the core K satisfies the requirements (3), y ∈ X, and x ∈ X - the desired function. The approximate solution of uno (1) is formed in the form of xn ≡ xn (t; {ci}) ≡ u (t) n - 1∑ = 0 ci t i + m - 1∑ i = 0 ci + n t i, (n ≥ 2) . (4) we find unknown parameters {ci} n+m - 10 according to the generalized collocation method from the system of linear algebraic equations (monga) (t axn –t y) (νk) = 0 (k = 1, n); (Axn - y) {i} (t j) = 0 (i = 0, m j −1, j = 1, q +2), (5) where {νk} is the system of the Chebyshev’s nodes of the first (or second) genus. Theorem 2. Let k eer a = {θ} in x, and h ≡ tt tsk (by t), tψ j i (i = 0, m j −1, j = 1, q +2), t y ∈ DL (J ). Then, with all n ≥ n0 ∈ N Slau (5), it has the only solution {c ∗ i} and the sequence of approximate solutions x ∗ n ≡ xn (t; {c ∗ i}) converges to the exact solution x ∗ = a -1Y in the space X with a speed of ∥x ∗ n −x ∗ ∥ = o {[e tn - 1 (h)+q+2∑ j = 1 m j - 1∑ = 0 en - 1 (tψ j i)+en - 1 (t y)] lnn}, where EL (q) is the best uniform approximation of the function g ∈ with polynomas of the degree not higher L ≥ 0. Now we consider optimization on the class of unambiguously permitted equations of the type (1) when the initial data belongs to the family C {p1 , p2; m} h rω ≡ {g ∈ C {p1, p2; m, τ} | t g ∈ H Rω}. Through VN (f) we denote [3] the optimal assessment of the error of all kinds of "polynomial" projection methods of solving uno (1) on the class f. Theorem 3. If f = c {p1, p2; m} h rω, then vn (f), ≍ n --rω (n - 1) ln n (n = n +m), and this optimal order realizes the proposed method ( 4)-(5). In case of proof of theorems 2, 3, the results of work are substantially used [1, 3]. 104 Materials of the International School-Conference Literature 1. Gabbasov N. S.
