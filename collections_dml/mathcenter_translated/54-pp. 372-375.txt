UDC 517.518.823 Assessment of the norm of the interpolation operator of the Hermit-Feier in the spaces of A. Sobolev Fedotov1 1 Fedotov@mi.ru; The Moscow Social and Humanitarian Institute received assessments of the norms of interpolation operators of the Hermita-Feier in one-dimensional in the multidimensional spaces of Sobolev. It is shown that in one case, the norm of this operator is limited. In the multidimensional case, the value of the norm depends on the ratio of the number of nodes for each coordinate. Keywords: Interpolation operator of the Hermita-Feiger, Sobolev's space. 1. One -dimensional case will, as usual, denote through n many natural numbers, N0 - many natural numbers supplemented by zero, z many integers, and R - many actual numbers. We fix S ∈ R and denote the order s through the h s, that is, the closure of all 2π-periodic complex functions of one re-A.I.

In the future, in the future in this section we will assume the condition s> 1/2, which (see, e.g., [1], p. functions, the first derivative of which is continuous. Let us fix n ∈N0, we introduce a mesh of the equivalent nodes tk = 2πk 2n +1, | k | ≤ n, (1) and designated through pn: h 1+s → h 1+s, (pn x) (τ) = ∑ | k | ≤n (x (tk)+i x ′ (tk) (1 –E1 (τ - tk)) μn (τ, tk), the operator of the Hermita -Feiger, which in each function x ∈ H 1+S puts the trigonometric interpolation of Polin of the Hermit -Feier pn x ∈ H 1+S by nodes (1 ) the first multiplicity.

A multidimensional case is fixed with M ∈N, M ≥ 2, and let N = NM, N0 = NM0, Z = ZM, R = RM, ∆ = [−π, π] M ⊂ R degrees of the degree of different numbers, natural numbers , supplemented by zero, integers, real numbers and segment [−π, π] ⊂ r, respectively. For elements l = (l1, l2, ..., lm), k = (k1, k2, ..., km) of these sets (M-component vectors), along with conventional operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication by the number, we introduce the following Operations: l · k = m∑ j = 1 l j k j, l 2 = m∑ j = 1 l 2j. In addition, we will write min (n) instead of min 1≤ j≤m {n j | n = (n1, n2, ..., nm) ∈ N0}. For a fixed s ∈R, we denote through the H S M-Mosary Space of Sobolev, that is, the closure relative to the norm is ∥u∥h s = {∑ lorn L2S | û (l) | 2} 12, l = {p l2, l ̸ = 0, 1, l = 0, l ∈ Z, where û (l) = (2π) −m ∆ u (τ) ēl (τ (τ) ) dτ, l ∈ Z, the essence of the factors Fourier of the function u ∈ H s according to the system of functions EL (τ) = EXP (I l τ), l = (l1, l2, ..., lm) ∈ Z, τ = (τ1 , τ2, ...,
