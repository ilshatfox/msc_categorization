The phenomenon of Gibbs for interpolation polynomas of the functions is well known (see [1], p. 126) the phenomenon of gibbes for the often dimensions with a limited change in its isolation points of the gap. At the same time, the constant Gibbs is 1.17 .... Let TP (F; x) - interpolation with Pauline with equivos with boxes 7R (2k + 1) 2 (n + l) 'k = o, 1, ..., p, functions f (x) with a limited change. The Gibbs effect is also observed for the polynomas TN (J; x). Constant Gibb CA in this case is 1.06. . .. There is an asymptotic formula ,,. 7r / 2 sin2 ~ TP (f; x) = (). 2 1g du+ o (l) = n+ 1 x ssh and about 158 ​​p. A. Korolkov "2 1 J Sin2 zu = -. 2 -du+ o (l) z ssh and (1) o x ~ o and p ~ oo. Formula (1) and the effect of Gibbs are first installed for function 00 fo (x) = lbksinkx, k = l if lk = 1/ k2 'k = 1, 2, ...' And then transferred to the production Functions of limited variation.
