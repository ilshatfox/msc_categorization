UDC 532.537 Application of mathematical models of hydromechanics of multiphase media to the numerical study of non -stationary processes in the heterogeneous low -temperature plasma of D.A. Tukmakov1 1 tukmakovda@imm.knc.ru; The Institute of Mechanics and Engineering of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the work on the basis of a numerical solution of the equations of multiphase media equations received a model of the dynamics of gases and drift of the dispersed phase in nonlinear waves of acoustic and electrostatic nature, as well as a mathematical model of the dynamics of particles suspension with a multicomponent dispersed phase. Keywords: mathematical modeling, hydrodynamics of multiphase media, the edge of the Koshi, the obvious of the end-and-growth scheme, low-temperature plasma with a solid condensed phase. Models of the dynamics of gases, consisting of particles carrying an electric charge, are used to describe a number of processes, which include spraying protective coatings on stained surfaces in an electrostatic field, as well as obtaining powder materials consisting of solid particles covered with a layer of polymer [1 -3]. Models of electrogasodynamics of gas supply, along with applied value, are used in describing self -organization phenomena in dust plasma, consisting of charged particles, the concentration of which is sufficient in order to create an electric field agreed with the spatial configuration of gases in the time [2.3]. So, in [1.2], complex plasma is considered, in which particles of dust are added to the general background of ions, electrons and neutral particles, which interacts with the surrounding plasma and leads to the emergence of new physical effects. In [4], experiments with dust thermodyffusion of dust moving from the dusty area to the area with clean gas are described. The spread of dust with various diffusion coefficients and particle charges has been investigated and a regime was revealed in which dust particles are self -organized into the toroidal structure. In the calculations performed in this work, the supporting environment is considered electrically neutral gas, since slow processes are considered, the course of which is large compared to the period of plasma vibrations [2.3]. The dispersed phase of the multiphase mixture consists of a combination of a certain number of fractions of solid particles, while each fraction is distinguished by volumetric content in the total volume of the multi -phase environment, the physical density of the substance, the size of the particles and their thermal conductivity. The environment is an electrically charged gases of the polydisperse composition, the particles of which are under the influence of the power of aerodynamic resistance, the forces of Archimedes, the forces of the joined mass D.A. Tukmakov 365 and forces acting from the electric field, which is created by a distributed charge of gas. To describe its movement, the system of the dynamics of the polydispersed multidispass and multi -temperature gases with high -speed and temperature gliding of phases is used [5]. The system includes the equations of motion of the bearing environment and the dispersed phase. The movement of the bearing environment is described by the system of entertaining equations, taking into account interfacial strength interaction and heat transfer: ∂ρ ∂t x + ∂ (ρu) ∂x + ∂ (ρv) ∂y = 0, ∂ (ρu) ∂t + ∂x (ρu2 + p ττxx) + ∂ ∂y (ρuv −τx y) = ∑ fxi + ∑ αi ∂p ∂x, ∂ (ρv) ∂t + ∂ ∂x (ρuv + p ττx y) + ∂ ∂y (ρv2 + p −τy y) = ∑ fyi + ∑ αi ∂p ∂y, ∂e ∂t + ∂x ([e + p τxx] u ττx y v + λ ∂x) + ∂ ∂y ([[ e +p −τy y] v ττx y u +λ ∂t ∂y) = = - ∑ qi - ∑ (| fxi | (u −ui) +| fyi | (v - vi)) +∑ αi (∂ (∂ ( pu) ∂x + ∂ (PV) ∂Y), p = (γ−1) (E −ρ (u2 + v2)/2), e = ρ (i + (u2 + v2)/2), τxx = µ (2 ∂u ∂x - 2 3 d), τy y = µ (2 ∂v ∂y - 2 3 d), τxx = µ (∂u ∂y + ∂v ∂x), d = µ (∂u (∂u ∂x + ∂v ∂y). Here ρ, u, e, t, λ, µ, γ is the density of the bearing phase, the speed of the bearing phase, complete energy and temperature of the high -temperature gas, thermal conductivity, viscosity and constant adiabata for the supporting gaseous environment, I = RT /(γ - 1 ) the internal energy of the bearing environment (here R is a constant gas for preheated air) [6]; The components of the force of the interfacial friction FXI, FYI and the heat flow from the surface of the I -I -fraction of the dispersed phase QI are determined by the laws of interfacial interaction. To describe the movement of the dispersed phase, the equation of the preservation of the average density of the dispersed phase, the equation of the preservation of the impulse and the equation of the preservation of internal energy [4]: ​​∂ρi ∂t + ∂x + ∂ρ vi ∂y = 0, ∂ (ρi UI) ∂ are used. t + ∂ ∂x (ρi u 2 i) + ∂ ∂y (ρi ui vi) = −fxi −fe xi −αi ∂p ∂x, ∂ (ρi vi) ∂t + ∂x (ρi ui vi) + ∂ ∂y (ρi v 2 i) = −fyi −Fe yi −αi ∂p ∂y, ∂ei ∂t + ∂x (ei ui) + ∂ ∂x (ei vi) = nu 6α 2 λ (T –Ti), ρi = αρi 0, e1 = ρi cpi ti. 366 Materials of the International School-Conference hereαi, ρi, EI, Ti-about
