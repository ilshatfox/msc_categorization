One method of solving the weak -random integral equation of the I - Rod considers one of the possible implementations of the method of solving the integrated equation KX ≡ 1 π 1∫ −1 ln | τ - t | √ τ2 x (τ) dτ + 1 π 1 τ τ τ − π 1 π 1 π 1 π is considered 1∫ −1 h (t, τ) √ 1– τ2 x (τ) dτ = y (t), (1) where y (t) and h (t, τ) are known continuous functions in areas, respectively [−1 ; 1] and [−1; 1] 2, and x (t) ∈ L2 (1 ed2; [−1; 1]) ≡ x - the desired function. The approximate solution of equation (1) is searched in the form of a splasen XN (t) = n∑ k = 0 αk accord (t), −1 ≤ t ≤ 1, n ∈ N, (2) where {onic (t)} n0 - fundamental sills The first degree in the net of nodes tl = −1 + 2l n, l = 0, n, n ∈ N. (3) unknown coefficients α0, α1 ,. . . αn are determined from the system of linear algebraic equations n∑ k = 0 αk n∑ l = 0 k (∗ tl) k (worj; tl) = n∑ l = 0 y (tl) k (∗j; tl), l = 0, N. (4) Theorem. Let the conditions are met: a) a homogeneous equation kx = 0 has only a trivial solution; 52 b) The heterogeneous equation (1) has a solution x ∗ ∈ X with a given right side y ∈ X. Then, with all n ∈ N, the system of equations (4) has a united solution α ∗ 0, α ∗ 1,. . . , α ∗ n. Approximate decisions x ∗ n (t) = n∑ k = 0 α ∗ k accord (t) (2 ∗) converge to the exact solution x ∗ (t) in the sense that {1 n n∑ k = 0 | y (tk) −k (x ∗ n; tk) | 2} 1/2 = o {en (x ∗) x} → 0, n → φ, (5) where EN (x ∗) x is the best approximation of the solution x ∗ (t ) in the space of X all kinds of species (2). 53 l and t e r a t r a 1.

Tikhonov (Kazan) Positively interpolation spaces for a pair of ordered banach spaces everywhere further further X = (X0, X1) indicate an interpolation pair of ordered banana spaces, i.e., we believe that the banakh space XI C Closed by the generating ki cones are embedded in some separated topological vector space V with a closed cone V +, and Ki ⊂ v + (I = 0, 1). Through L+(x) we denote the many limited linear operators in pair X, translating Ki into ki (I = 0, 1). Definition. The space X with a closed cone K ⊂ v + invested in the X0 + X1 Banakhovo will be called positively interpolation for pair X if any operator from L + (X) translates K to K. Offer. If the space X with the K cone is positively interpolarly for X and the cone k generating, then X interpolation for positive operators in X, i.e., any operator from L+(x) translates X to X and there is constant C> 0 that ‖T ‖X → X ≤ c max {‖t‖x0 → x0, ‖t‖x1 → x1} for any t ∈ L+(x). We give one method of constructing a positively interpol spaces. Let Y - the space interpolation for pair X in the usual sense, and let KY - the closure of K0 ∩ K1 in Y. Put ỹ = {x = x ′ - x ′ ′: x ′, x ′ ′ ∈ Ky}, ‖X‖ ỹ = inf {‖X′‖‖y + ‖X′‖y: x = x ′ - x ′ ′; x ′, x ′ ′ ∈ Ky}. 54
