The projective limits of the spaces of measurable functions with the serial units according to the steppe parameter and their dual albeit (ω, σ, µ) -space with σ -inferior measure, and l0 (ω, σ, µ) -the corresponding space of all measurable functions. Let F ∈ L0 (ω, σ, µ) and F> 0 almost everywhere. For α ∈ R, consider i (Fα) = {g ∈ L0 (ω, σ, µ) | ∃λ ∈ R+ (−λfα 6 g 6 λfα)} with the norm PFα (G) = Inf {λ ∈ R+ | - λfα 6 g 6 λfα}. Dual spaces I ∗ (Fα) in this case is provided with the norm RFα (∗) = SUP {| onic (G) | | g ∈ I (Fα), PFα (G) 6 1}. Next ω0 = {x ∈ ω | | f (x) | 6 1}, ωicle = {x ∈ ω | | f (x) | > 1}, σ0 = {a ∩ ω0 | A ∈ σ}, σ least = {A ∩ ωicle | A ∈ σ}, µ0 = µ | σ0, µy = µ | σ least. In this case, the functions f0 = f | ω0, fild = f | ωicle are measurable for spaces with a measure (ω0, σ0, µ0) and (ωicle, σ least, µirl. Fα) isometrically isomorphically with topologists of the vector spaces (I (Fα0) ⊕ I (Fαmber)) ∗ and I ∗ (Fα0) ⊕ i ∗ (Fαurb). For a positive material α> 0, the replenishment of many restrictions is mean {∗ | Iering (f0) | onic ∈ I ∗ (Fα0)}, equipped with the norm R′Fα0 (onic | IU (F0)) = SUP {| onic (f0) (g) | g ∈ I urb (F0), PFα0 (G) 6 1}. We determine the maximum space J0 fine: = ⋃ α> 0 J0α and supplying it with the final topology T0 for display Aα: x ∈ (J0α, R′Fα0) 7 → X ∈ J 0 ⇒ through T 0α, we denote the topology of the space (I (F α 0), R ′ Fα0). For β> α through (t 0α) β, we denote the topology, induced T 0α in I (F β 0), i.e. Topology (I (F β 0), R ′ Fα0). For positive α <β, the inclusion i (Fαicle) ⊂ ⊂ i (fβult) is true. For all ∗ ∈ I ∗ (fβ care), restriction eed (fα Φ) lies in i ∗ (Fαurb). In addition, for any α> 0 and for any continuous linear functionality ∗ on (iw (finger), τicle) restriction ∗ | i (Fα mm) lies in i ∗ (Fαurb). We supply the Jingly space of all the continuous functionals on the local-convergated space (iw (Finger), τicle) by the local-convex topology tips all half of the norms ρα (α> 0), such as ρα (ship) = Rα (onic | i (Fα mm)). Theorem 1. (Jinger, Tinger) - Freche's space. Theorem 2. Space IU (F) = iU (F0) ⊕IU (FU), equipped with a topology with the base τ0 × τicle, and the space JU (F): = J0 charul ⊕ JUs, equipped Topology with the base T0 × Tives are in duality. 172.Sh.

For this, various classifiers are used, among which UDC, BBK and MSC2010 are most famous [1] - [3]. They contain alphanumer codes. Note that the process of manual selection of classification codes is difficult due to the large volume of classifiers. For example, UDC contains more than 120 thousand items.
