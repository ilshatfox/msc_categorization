Locally convex spaces, the calculation of topological bases in local convex spaces is associated with the clarification of the conditions of existence and constructing homomorphisms acting from a given LVP E into some separated LCP, the basis of which exists. The functional implementation of E as a vector space of continuous numerical functions is considered, that is, the linear functionality (dirac function) δt: <x, δt> = x (t), x (t) ∈ E, t ∈ K ⊂ T (t - t - t - t - t - t - t - Locally compact space, k - compact in T). Theorem. Let E and F - separated by the LVP, a: e → f - linear continuous, and, therefore, the slightly continuous display E in f, a ′ is its conjugated display, which is the weak isomorphism of the space F ′ in E ′. Let the many a ′ (F ′) ⊂ e ′ total on e and Δt ∈ A ′ (F ′). If E is completely full, and F is sideways, then A is the topological isomorphism of the spaces e and f. A continuous operator reverse for the operator A can be built in this way: since Δt ∈ A ′ (F ′) ⊂ e ′, t ∈ K, there is a weak solution GT ′ A equation A′GT = ΔT, as a result of which equality is fair 136 x (t) = <x, δt> = <x, a ′ gt> = <ax, gt> = <f, gt>, f ∈ F, gt ∈ F ′ ∀x ∈ E. Thus of the formula x = GF, F ∈ F, X ∈ E is defined by the linear continuous operator G, acting from F to E, reverse for the operator A. Let (FI) - the basis in F, and a series ∑mber i = 1 λifi converges in the topology of space f. Then a row ∑µ i = 1 λig (fi) = ∑ et I = 1 λi accord is also related (in the topology of space E). Thus, the operator G: F → E, according to the well -known base of space, F generates the basis in E. space F with the basis we call calibration for E.L. T R A T R A 1.
