) A generalization of the scheme of M.A. Lavrentieva in case of suspicimal and asymmetric tear -off currents Introduction. To describe the tearful flow of bodies with the formation of finite stationary vortex zones in [1], a scheme was proposed in which the course is divided into two parts: the main potential stream D0 and a closed trace of the streamlined body DPA, in which the diminishment ω is constant; The speed at the section of the section is continuous. Subsequently, this scheme is called the potential-vikhrean scheme of M.A. Lavrentieva [2]. In the original production, it was intended for modeling a flat symmetrical flow of 199 of a single, thawed body with a homogeneous limitless stream of an ideal inconspicuous fluid. If the Cartesian system is coordinate X, Y, choose so that the plane of the symmetry of the body and the direction of the flow coincide with the axis X, then it is enough to consider the upper half -plate y> 0. In this case, the course of the course below is limited by the Symmetry line y = 0 and the upper boundary of the streamlined body y = y0 (x)> 0, where the condition of the conductor ψ = 0. Along with the boundless stream, within the framework of the Lavrentiev scheme, the currents in the channels without friction on the walls can be examined if you set the upper boundary of the flow y = y1> y0 as a current line ψ = q > 0, where Q is a given fluid consumption in the channel. The current function and vortex in a flat case are associated with the speed field by ratios UX = ∂∂y, uy = - ∂ ∂x, ω = –∂ux ∂y + ∂uy ∂x. (1) Directly from this definition, the two -dimensional equation of Poisson for the current function ψ, and in accordance with the estimated stream scheme, can be recorded ∆ψ ≡ 2ψ ∂x2 + ∂2ψ ∂y2 = ω) = {0 in D0, - - - W0 in dω. (2) Against of the body, the unfinished course is set by the function of the current ψ = Qy/Y1. The size of the twisting w0 <0 is a free parameter of the model, the adequate choice of which is an independent problem. Significant in this formulation is the ability to formally distinguish the vortex zone using the condition ψ <0, as well as set the speed of speed in the vortex zone γ = ∫∫ dω ω dxdy = ω0 ∫∫ d [1– h (ψ) dxdy, d instead of W0 = D0 + dω, where H is the function of the Hevisayd. As a result, from the equation (2), we pass to the equation - ose = γ · f (ψ), f ≡ [1– h (ψ)]/ ∫∫ d [1– h (ψ)] dxdy. (3) Some private decisions of the potential-vicar circuit of Lavrentiev for a flat symmetrical stream were obtained in the work [2]-[5]. This article proposes new formulations and numerical algorithms for solving a potentially vicar problem, allowing you to calculate the internal asymmetric flow of several obstacles with a flat stream, as well as tear-off currents in round pipes. 200 asymmetric flow. Consider a flat channel, on the internal walls of which there are poorly streamlined protrusions of various forms. It can be expected that behind these obstacles will form closed vortex zones, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1: The asymmetric potentially-vichrer diagram of the internal tear-off current, the main potential stream D0 is asymmetric, and the signs ω in the upper D+I and the lower D-I vortex areas are opposite. The vortex traces themselves are separated by the following conditions ψ <0 in D - I, I = 1, ..., N -; ψ> q in d +j = 1, ..., n +. This allows you to introduce two free parameters of a generalized potentially vichery scheme: γ+> 0 and γ-<0. Each of them represents the total speed of speed in vortex zones at the upper and lower walls of the canal, so that γ+ = n+ ∑ j = 1 γ +j, γ - = n - ∑ i = 1 γ --i, a of the validity values ​​in all vortex zones at the upper and lower walls are constant and equal, respectively, ω+= γ+/ n+∑ j = 1 mes d+j> 0 and ω - = γ -/ n - ∑ i = 1 mes d --i <0. Here, the area of ​​the region A. 201 Thus, the equation (3) for asymmetric flow can be written in the form of −∆ψ = bψ ≡ γ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ ≡ + · F+ (ψ)+ γ - · f - (ψ), x, y ∈ D, f - = 1– h (ψ) ∫∫ D [1– h (ψ)] dxdy, f+ = h (ψ - q) ∫∫ d h (ψ - q) dxdy. (4) The boundary conditions of the problem are set as follows (see Fig. 1): x = x0: ψ = yq y1; x = x1: ∂∂ ∂n = uy = 0; y = y0 (x): ψ = 0; y = y1 (x): ψ = q. (5) Mathematical model (4)-(5) generalizes the potential and vichensal diagram of M.A. Lavrentiev in case of a flat asymmetric tear -off course in the channels. Note that this setting of the task applies to flat channels of arbitrary form. Numerical study of the model. Conduct a theoretical study of the regional task (4)-(5) is extremely difficult, primarily due to the nonlinearity of the operator B in the right side of the determining equation. At the same time, the issues of resolving the problem, the stability of its solution according to the parameters γ - γ+ are represented very relevant. Even when constructing close decisions of the problem of symmetrical flow (2) in the works [2], [3], [5], certain difficulties are noted, which were explained by the internal properties of the equation, an example of the uniting solution is given. In this work, an attempt was made to establish some singular properties of solving the problem using a numerical experiment. For this, two different and
