The theorem of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the linear integrated equations of Voltairer in the space of linear functions is denoted through s [a, b) (where ~ qo) the space of the functions that are determined on [a, b) that have the end at each point (a, b) The limits left and right, and at point A has the final limit on the right. It is known that if the function x (t) e s \ a, b), then it is limited on each for a ~ fed segment from [a, b) [1]. Consider the equation t x (t) = j q (t, s) x (s) ds + f (t), t e [a, b), (1) where q (t, s) is determined at a ~ s ~ t <b, summarized at each t e [a, b) by s for [a, t), measurable in terms of variables. In addition, suppose that for Q (t, s) you are full of the ratio T S_UP J IQ (T, S) I DS <SE, T E [A, B) A (2) 298 T. N. Tsalyuk with J Q ( t, s) ds e s [a, b) \/s e (a, b), (3) 11 IQ (t, s) i ~ k (t, s), (4) and k (t, s ) satisfies the condition of Radon [2]. In addition, we believe that q (t, s) = o t <s, and j (t) e s [a, b). There is a theorem. Let Y.Do q (t, s) satisfy. Then the following are fairly approved. I. I: 1) equation (1) has the only one in s [a, b) a solution; 2. (t) = j (t) + j r (t, s) j (s) ds; a 3) r (t, s) satisfies the volume of ~ "yuh.m equations of the dl. Literature 1. Burbaki N.
