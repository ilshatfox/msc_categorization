The area of ​​existence of the sum of the series of exponential monomas will consider the series OO, MK-1 F (Z) = L DK, NZN Exp (LKZ). (1) k = l, n = o is the question when the area of ​​existence of the function f (z) coincides with the row convergence area (1). Pre -preliminary but introduce some designations. Through A denote the maxi density of the sequence {lk} ~ 1, i.e. - k a = limk-+oo 1 lk! . We still put where QK (T5) = O. S. Kudryavtseva LBL Theorem. In order to that the existence of the function of the function f (z) coincided with the register of convergence of the row (1), it was necessary and expert, 'Ch. Mobt is executed. As a result, we give one of the results for the ranks of Di Richla. The investigation (Carlson and Landau theorem). Empty> .k = o and mk = 1, k = 1, 2, ....
