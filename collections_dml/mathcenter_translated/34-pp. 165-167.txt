Nazipov Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University, Kazan is considered the integral equation Aaper ≡ a (t) С (t) + 1∫ 0 h (t-τ) ∈ (t-τ) ( t) dt = f (t), 0 6 t 6 1, (1) where a (t) ∈ C [0, 1], f (t) ∈ L2 (0, 1) and H (t) ∈ L1 ( −1, 1) - known material functions, and onic (t) ∈ L2 (0, 1) - the desired function. Lemma. Let the conditions α) min 06t61 | a (t) | > m = const> 0; β) h (–T) = −h (t), - 1 6 T 6 1. Then the equation (1) has the only solution onic ∗ ∈ L2 (0, 1) with any right part F ∈ L2 (0, 1) , moreover, ‖ vents ∗ ‖l2 (0.1) 6 ‖f‖l2 (0.1)/m. (2) 167 Theorem. In the conditions of Lemma, the only solution is ∗ ∗ ∈ L2 (0, 1) of equation (1) can be found by the iteration method ∗i + 1 (t) = ∗ + m m2 {f (t) —a (Сory; t)},},}, I = 0, 1,. . . , (3) at any initial approximation eer (t) ∈ L2 (0, 1). The error of the i-hut can be evaluated by inequalities ‖ vents (t)-С (t) ‖l2 (0.1) 6 Q I‖ accord (t)-∗0 (t) ‖l2 (0.1) 6 6 Qi 1 - Q ‖ware (t) - ∗0 (t) ‖l2 (0.1), (4) where I = 0, 1 ,. . . , and q = √ 1 - (m/m) 2 <1, m = max 06t61 | a (t) | + 1∫ −1 | H (t) | dt. Consequence. If the initial approximation is selected according to the formula wor (t) = m/m 2 · f (t), then the method of the method (3) can be evaluated both by formulas (4) and the formula ‖ware ∗ (t) (t) - С (t) ‖L2 (0.1) 6 Qi+1 1 - Q m m2 ‖f (t) ‖l2 (0.1), I = 0, 1 ,. . . Note that the above Lemma and theorem are proven using the relevant results of books [1,2]. L and T R A T R A 1. Gabdulkhaev B.G.

Nuyatov Institute of Mathematics with the CU Uc Railern RAS, shaig@anrb.ru Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, root@mm.un.ru let PN (Z) and QM (Z) - polynomials of degrees N and M. Through IP (Z), we denote the ideal in the algebra of all the whole functions H (C), generated by the polynomial p (z). Let the WQ - the space of all solutions of the differential equation Q (D DZ) Y = 0. Consider many functions of the type IP +WQ. It is known that if n = m and qn (z) = pn (z), then h (c) = ip ⊕wq (symbol ⊕ means direct amount). The question naturally arises: what is the amount of IP +WQ in the case when the degree of M> N or M <n? Consider the case when the degree of polynoma Q (Z) is more than the degree of polynoma P (Z), that is, Degq> Degp. We always imagine the polynomial Q (Z) in the form of a work of two polynomials of the lesser degree: Q (Z) = Q1Q2 (Z), and Degq1 = 169
