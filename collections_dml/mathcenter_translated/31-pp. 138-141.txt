One model of economic development 140 T. V. Svirilina Ryazan State University, dma@rspu.ryazan.ru mathematical model of the dynamics of gross domestic product, taking into account the recovery of investment and delay in human capital formation, is described by a system of differential equations with a deviation of ẏ1 (t) = –A1Y1Y1 (t) + y2 (t) + η̄1, ẏ2 (t) = λ1y2 (h (t)) + λ1λ2f1 (y (t)) + η̄2, ẏ3 (t) = —a2y3 (t) + a3λ2f1 (y (y (y (y. t)) + λ2f2 (y (t)) + η̄3, ẏ4 (t) = −2y4 (h (t)) + λ2y3 (t) + η̄4, where y1 (t) is the level of fixed assets (OPF) of production capital at the time of time t; Y2 (t) - the intensity of the input of real gross investments in the OPF at the time of time t; y3 (t) - potential (future) level of human capital (knowledge) at time t; Y4 (t) - the real level of human capital at the time of time t; h (t) = [t/τ0] τ0, τ0 - the time of delayed input of real investments and delay in the formation of human capital; A1 - OPF depreciation rate; A2 - the norm of the depreciation of human capital; A3 - the coefficient of the effectiveness of the training of physical labor workers; F1 and F2 - animated production functions; The parameter λ = (λ1, λ2) characterizes the influence of the external environment on the growth rate of the scale of production and the growth of labor resources (taxation, pricing, tariffs for electricity, the availability of education); η̄i = η (ηi, λ), where ηi is uncontrolled disturbances. The task of finding conditions is set under which the studied system during the time T = ω spontaneously goes into the original state (the solution of the two -point marginal periodical problem Y (0) = Y (ω)). 141
