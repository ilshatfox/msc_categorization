Multi-digit dynamic systems with Libra of P. I. Troshin Kazan State University, troshin@hitv.ru in this paper we propose to consider M-digit (m ∈ N) Transformation of the probabilistic space (x, b, µ), which can be represented as a union 1-digit transformations s (x) = ⋃m j = 1 sj (x). We equip this transformation with a set of measurable functions-worts {αj: x → (0, 1]} mj = 1 with the property ∑m j = 1 αj (x) ≡ 1. Four (x, b, µ, s) we will call many-valid dynamic a system with weights. We give analogues of concepts and theorems from the ergodic theory of 1-digit dynamic systems (see [1]). Namely, a new measure on b µs (b) = m∑ j = 1 ∫ S −1 j. (B) αj (x) dµ, operator of the Kupman UF (x) = m∑ j = 1 αj (x) · f (sj (x)), the operator of the Frobenius - the platform P: l1 (x, b, µ) → l1 (X, b, µ), set by the equation ∫ b pf dµ = m∑ j = 1 ∫ s −1 j (b) αj (x) · f (x) dµ, and the concept of ergodism s when ∀f ∈ L1 ∀ g ∈ LIUS LIM N → mit 1 n - 1∑ k = 0 ∫ x p kf (x) g (x) dµ = = ∫ x f dµ · · x g dµ. 202 We have the ability to achieve the conditions of preservation of the measure (µs = = µ) and ergodicity s, using the choice of weights {αj} mj = 1 (some generalization of the results in [2]). Among the others, we have proved the following main facts: 1) u | LP - compression on LP and U | L1 - Markov operator. 2) If µS = µ, then ∀f ∈ LP (p <mm) ∃f ∗ ∈ LP: lim n → ‖ 1 n - 1∑ k = 0 ukf - f ‖lp = 0. 3) if f ∈ L1 and g ∈ Lear, then ∫ x pf · g dµ = ∫ x f · ug dµ. 4) If ‖f‖l1 = 1, f> 0, then pf = f, then and only when s retains the measure ν (b) = ∫ b f dµ. 5) If s is ergodic, then ug = g, g ∈ Lear, and only when G is constant. 6) If ∀f ∈ L1 lim n → φ ‖p nf - ∫ x f dµ‖l1 = 0, then s ergodic.
