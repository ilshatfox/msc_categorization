One multi -element functional equation and its application to the problem of the moments considered the functional equation (V F) (Z) ≡ (V1F) (Z) - (V1F) (IZ) = G (Z), Z ∈ RONE, where (V1F) (Z) (Z) ) ≡ f (z - λ) + f (z + λ) + f (z - λ - 2λi) + f (z + λ - 2λi) + f (z - λ + 2λi) + f (z + λ + 2λi). Here λ> 0, Rλ is a square with the vertices of ± λ λ λi (the signs are not agreed), and the free member G (Z) is the holomorphone in this square and its boundary value G+ satisfies the Helder condition, G (IZ) = —G (Z ). The solution is found in the class of even functions represented by an integral type of Koshi F (Z) = 1 2πi ∫ γ (τ - z) −1 onic (τ) Dτ with an unknown odd density that satisfies the condition of Helder to γ ​​= [ - −λi, λi]. The applications of this equation are indicated to the problem of the moments of Studyes of entire functions of class A and to the problem of decomposition of functions, holomorphic in circular moons, in biralonal rows. 33
