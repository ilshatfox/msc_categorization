Variation of the capacity of a three -dimensional capacitor with a smooth change in its border, let D is the area concluded between closed, smooth cinema, dipho -nomorphic sphere surfaces σ0 and σ1 that σ1 covers σ0. Let the function u: d → [0, 1] belongs to the class C (D) ∪ c2 (D) and is a solution to the next task of the conductor    u (x) = 0, x ∈ D, u (x) = 0, x ∈ σ0, u (x) = 1, x ∈ σ1. Definition. The value of cap (d) = ∫ d ∇u (x) ‖2 dx is called the conformal capacity of the capacitor with the field d. Variations of capacitors' capacities with a smooth change in its boundary plates were considered earlier, for example, in [1] for the case of flat areas and in [2] for capacitors in RN, the field of which is limited by concentric spheres. We continue these studies. A. O. Novikov 119 Let С a unit limited by the unit with a compact carrier, which is a subset of the WAR of parameterization (denot it G) of one of the boundary surfaces (for certainty, you can choose the outer surface σ1), and ε is some fixed small number. The area located between the surfaces σ0 and σ1, ε: = {y + onic (y) ~ n (y), y ∈ G}, where ~ n (y) there is a vector of the internal normal, taken at point y, design . Theorem. If the sets D and ∂D belong to the class SU C2, α, 0 <α <1 (see [3, p. 95]), many zero of the grace of the function of the function U is a zero-many, and the display induced by potential curves is normalized so that the length of the vector of the tangent to such a curve at each point is the opposite value of the square of the gradient of the function U is dipheromorphism (with the exception, it can be, the final number of points), then, with an accuracy of a small higher order than ε, has The place is unequal by the CAP (dε) - CAP (D) 6 C (ε), where c (ε) ∼ ∫ d \ dε ∇ ∇u (x) ‖2 dx, ε → 0. l and t t u.

February National Research Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, vvnovikov2007@yandex.ru, grigorieva_ln@mail.ru The task of laminar Dynamo is the task of moving the conducting viscous fluid between the non -certificate sphere of the mi. It is believed that the center of symmetry of the internal sphere of shifts of the chickpeas relative to the center of the external sphere in the equatorial plane at a short distance. Within the framework of this model, the solution of the problem of hydrodynamics that does not take into account the influence of the magnetic field on the movement of fluid allows you to obtain a radial course [1]. In this paper, the question of the possibility of generating a magnetic field by the fluid by the fluid found in [1]. We write down the equations of magnetic hydrodynamics [2] in the ends of measured form: ε rot (∂ ~ v ∂t + (~ v, ▽) ~ v) = s rot (~ h, ▽) ~ h + rot ~ v, (1) ∂ ~ h ∂t = rm rot [~ v, ~ h] +△ ~ h, (2) div ~ v = 0, (3) div ~ h = 0, (4)
