Carleman multi -elemental task for a square let R is a square with the vertices T 1 = -TZ = -(1 + I) /2, t2 = -t4 = (1 -i) /2 and sides lj, j = 1.4, are numbered. In order of positive bypass, the circuit r = d r, starting from the base of the square (IM t = -1/2 * t e l1). Let where fj ± (t) = {a (t) ± 1, t e l1 u lz; a (t) ± · i, t e l2 u l4} (signs are coordinated), a (t) = t + ij, t e lj, a multi-elementary for. a (t)] + g (t), t e, where for. Denet function g (t) e nµ (d), o <µ ~ 1, g (t) + g [a (t)] = = = = = = = = = = = = O. The function F (Z), the holomorphic outside the square, f (OO) = O, the boundary value of which p- (t) satisfies the condition of the gelder on each open smooth component G, on any of the sides. At the peaks, the most pain of the neck, logarithmic features are allowed. To decide for. The country, when the method of equivalent regulatory is changed, based on the presentation of the solution in the form of the integral f (z) = ~ j ip (r) (r - z) -1dr, z rf. R, 21g ~ g with an unknown density IP (R), satisfying the condition IP (t) + IP [a (t)] = about. It is proved that this task is unconditionally solved.
