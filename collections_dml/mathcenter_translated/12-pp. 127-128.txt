. The study of the mixed shape of the loss of stability of the three -layer plate, which is in the heterogeneous in thickness of the temperature field A.A. Bushkov, I.I. Maslov, T.V. Polyakova KGSU, KPU them. A.N. Tupoleva, KSTU, Kazan considered the Linearized task of the mixed form of stability loss (FPU) of an infinitely wide three-layer plain with a transversal-soft aggregate, located in a non-norce-naive temperature field in thickness. It is assumed that the lower layer on the ends of the p; Tastina x = o, a (a - the length of the plate) is fixed amazingly motionless, and the upper layer has a fixed hinge; Due to the subtleties of these layers, the distribution of the temperature of their thickness is accepted uniformly, and in the filler it subordinates the linear law T (Z) = g +zg, g = (t "1 +t '2 1) 2, g = (' '(' ' ) -T '2') 2h, -H5z5h. Here 2h - the thickness of the aggregate; t '", t" - increasing temperature in the supporting layers. It has been established that in the pre -critical state, the initial efforts of 0 tea 01 Â° _ are formed in the non -existing layers. F;)) = -q ()) = - t, 2) = O 'L -V 127 Where T - the thickness of the supporting layer, V is the coefficient of 1 Luoasson, and the coeff is the fitsent of the temperature expansion. With such efforts, the task is considered. It turns out the equivalent task of the mixed FPU of the three -layer P :: ~ Astin, compressed by axial efforts through one layer, which was examined in detail in the article [1]. Its solution was found on the BA stability equations dedicated to [!], And has the form of et ' D = 'L2 (1 -V 2)' where T: ~ 1 is an dimensionless parameter of the force, and D is the rigidity of the bearing layer to bend.
