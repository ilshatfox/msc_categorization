) One counter example in the theory of measures on the final logic of the sets built the logic of the sets L (see [1.2]) on a 33-element set such that: (i) L is a lattice; (II) Any maximum chain in L 4-elementa; (III) L has a trivial center; (IV) Count of the ratio of orthogonality on atoms in l bunch; (v) there is a two -digit state on L, which is not a nonsense combination of point states; (VI) Any charge of L is a linear combination of double -digit states.
