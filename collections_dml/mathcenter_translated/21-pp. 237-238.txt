). Geometric modeling of an ordinary differential "equation of the 3rd Order of E. M. Shibalov Nizhny Novgorod state: n: n: n: n: n: named named after N. I. Lobachevsky, Emsh@Mail. Nnov. Ru on the material line R examines the ordinary dipfer RENCIONAL equation (ODU) 3 -the order as a suburbs n space of stratum strugg (r, 1). Under certain conditions of regularity, the equation is permitted relative to the coordinate D3X/DT3. In adapted coordinates t, x, dx/dt, jlx/dt2, d3x/dt3 of the 5th time the order permitted relative to the coordinates of D3X/DT3 has the form D3x/DT3 = F (T, X, DX/DT, D.2XJDT2). (1) by introducing an additional one, the variable x2 = dx 1/dt equation (1) is reduced To quasi-deesic in the Goku (KP)-an ODU of the 2nd order of the species as is known from (LJ, the KP type (2) allows the geometric model. The geodetic model (see [LJ) of the KP (2) will be called the geodetic model of the original equation ( 1). Each integral curve of KP (2) In the space of variables x 1, x2, t, therefore, each integral curve of equations (1), with this modeling, coincides with the geodetic lines of fashion 237 of the flowing coherence. On the basis of this, the following results were obtained, in particular. Theorem 1. DM that KL {2) 6wt is a day is a day is vivalent is a trivial flow is needed enough that it is b ~ nrav ~ e of part of the equation {1) bwlu fun, supervised by Tolyso from. Theorem 2. DLD “that KL (2) btxji is pointedly equalized by the valentine · Ivial stream, is not necessary and sufficient, 'so that the equal parts of the equation (1) B'y. 11. And functions that depend only on . Consequence. Schu. Yaki is a pointedly non -equivalent trivial clock of the species (2), you need to be a point of affiliation: ~ quiva le ~ solid trivial.
