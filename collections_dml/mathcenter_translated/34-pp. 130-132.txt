. The maximum Torah of the Algebra of the series R. I. Kuznetsov, O. A. Muelar Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, milyar@mail.nnov.ru, kuznets@unn.ac.ru The 26-dimensional simple algebra Lee R (1, 1) Characteristics 3 from the Algebrian R (M1, M2) series is considered [1] [1] - [3], which are neither classic nor algebrays whether the Novsk type map. Algebra R = R (1, 1) has a Z2 gorgeon: R = R0 ⊕R1, 132 where R0 = W (2: 1, 1) is the algebra of Witt, R1 = B 2 (ω)-a ground of accurate forms of degree 2. Using the theory of co -administered modules [4], and the structure of autorphisms of the algebr of the series R [5] proved the theorem. All maximum tori P-algebras R are two-dimensional and are the Kartan's Podalgebrays. There are 7 grades from the flexibility of maximum torus relative to the physical aids. Any maximum Thor is associated with one of the blowing tori: t1 = <t1 = (1 + x1) ∂1, t2 = (1 + x2) ∂2>, t2 = <t1 = (1 + x1) ∂1, t2 = x2 ∂2>, t3 = <t1 = (1 + x1) ∂1, t2 = (1 + x1) 2ω + x2∂2>, t4 = <t1 = (1 + x1) ∂1, t2 = (1 + x1 ) 2x2ω + x2∂2>, t5 = <t1 = x1∂1 - x2∂2, t2 = ω + x1∂1>, t6 = <t1 = x1∂1 + x2∂2, t2 = x1ω + x1∂111 >, T7 = <t1 = x1∂1, t2 = x2∂2>.

The contact task for the spherical shell interacting with the strict plane of S. A. Kuznetsov, D. M. Salakhov Kazan State University in the work considers a thin shell of constant crowd, the material obeys the Law of the Hook, it is assumed that movements in the shell are quite small, while ensuring The geometric linearity is also also. The reservoir is filled with a bone, that is, it is subjected to internal hydro -pressure pressure, which is directed by normal to the surface. The problem is solved taking into account the following assumptions: - under the influence of hydrostatic pressure, the median surface of the shell is subjected to suspicimimetric deform of the matting; The tensile stresses are distributed evenly along the thickness of the shell; -taking into account the shape of the median surface of the shell, the hacker of the power exposure, including on the circuit, and the shell rocket, the membrane can be neglected by the influence on the intense-deformed state of bending and twisting moments and transverse forces [1]; - its own weight of the tank is not taken into account; 134
