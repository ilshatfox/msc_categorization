Pershagin2 1 jagachev@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky 2 mpershagin@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky in the article gives the theoretical and functional justification of the general polynomial projection method of solving regional problems for one class of conditionally correct integro -radio equations. The equations are characterized by the positive of the difference in the order of internal and external differential operators. As a result, the convergence of the methods of gallerkin and collocation is established. Keywords: Sobolev’s space, integro -radio equation, general regional task, projection method, polynomial approach, method of method. The general linear edge of the Ri (x) = 0, i = 1, (1) for the integro -differential equation K x ≡ x (t)+ m∑ k = 1 gk (m - m - m - k) (t) + r∑ j = 0 + 1ˆ −1 h j (t, s) x (j) (s) d s = y (t), −1 é t é 1, (2) where {ri} - linear-dependent functionality in space (M-1)-immediately differentiated on the segment [−1,1] of functions, y (t), gk (t), k = 1, m, and h J (t, s), j = 0, r, - known functions in their areas of definition. Let w p lq ≡ w p lq [−1,1], p ∈ N, 1 é q é φ, the essence of the space of the Sobolev functions that have an absolutely continuous derivative of the order p −1, the derivative of which belongs to the space of the LQ ≡ LQ Lebble. (−1,1) (lip ≡c). The task (1), (2) will be considered in a pair of spaces (x, y), where x = ° w r lq is a subspace of functions from W R LQ, satisfying the regional conditions (1), and y = w p lq, where p. = r −m ê 1. In space Y, we set the norm with the formula ∥ f ∥p; q ≡ f ∥w p lq = ∥ f ∥q +∥ f (p) ∥q, f ∈W P LQ, and in space X - formula: ∥x∥x = ∥x (m) ∥q +∥x (r) ∥q, x ∈ X. The correct setting of the problem (1), (2) in a pair of spaces (x, y) is studied in [1]. We write down the initial task in the operator: k x ≡ dx +gx +h x = y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y), 34 materials of the international school-conference where dx ≡ x (m), gx ≡ (gx) (t) = m∑ k = 1 gk (t) x (m --k) (t), h x ≡ (h x) (t) = r∑ j = 0 +1ˆ −1 h J (t, s) x (j) (s) d s. Let xn = ihn+m ⊂ x, yn = ihn, pn: y - → yn - a fixed design operator. According to the general projection method, the approximate solution XN ∈ XN tasks (1), (2) will look for as an exact solution to the equation KN XN ≡ DXN +PNGXN +PN H XN = PN Y (XN ∈ XN). (3) The following theorem 1. Let the assumptions take place: 1) y ∈ Y; 2) G +H: X → Y - a completely continuous operator; 3) the initial task has the only solution for any right side of Y; 4) p 2n = pn and ∥pn∥y → y = o (mn), n → urb. If y and h are such that mn · [en (y) y +en (gx ∗) +en (h x ∗ y] → 0, n → ∞, then for fairly large n equation (3) has the only solution. In this case, close solutions converge to the exact norm of space X at the speed: ∥x ∗ n −x ∗ ∥x = o (mn · [en (y) y +en (gx ∗) y +en (h x ∗) Y] ). Further, without limiting the community, functionality {ri} we will consider discrete, namely, Ri (x) = x (i -1) ( - 1), i = 1, m. This is done only for clarity of the following computing schemes of specific methods. Galerkin method. The approximate solution of the problem (1), (2) we are looking for in the form of xn (t) = n+m∑ k = m αk (t +1) k, (4) and unknown coefficients {αk} n+m m are determined from the conditions (k xn - y, t j) = 0, j = 0, n, where the scalar product is introduced in the space L2. These conditions are equivalent to the system of linear algebraic equations (SLAU) n+m∑ k = m γk jαk = y j, j = 0, n, (5) Yu.R. Agachev, M.Yu. Pershagin 35 where γk j = (k (t +1) k, t j) 2, y j = (y, t j) 2. (6) sludge (5), (6) is equivalent to the equation KN xn ≡ dxn +sngxn +sn h H xn = sn y (xn ∈ XN), in which SN is the Fourier operator built according to the orthogonal system of polynomes in L2, that is, the Lyandra polynoma system. In the space y = w p l2, we introduce the class ỹ = w 2p h2, α of the functions, the 2p derivative of which belongs to the Helder class in space L2 with an indicator 0 <αé 1, while p = r --m oup 2. Let 2. Let 2. Let it be Assumptions were made: 1) gk, k = 1, m, y ∈ ỹ; 2) H J ∈ ỹ × L1, J = 0, R −1; 3) hr ∈ ỹ × l2; 4) a homogeneous task corresponding to (1), (2), has only a zero solution. Then the system (5), (6) has the only solution {α ∗ k} n+m k = m (at least for all n, starting with some N0). Close decisions x ∗ n (t) built according to the formula (4) with αk = α ∗ k, converge to the exact solution of x ∗ (t) of the problem (1), (2) in the space X at the speed: ∥x ∗ ∗ ∗ n∥x = o (n --α). Collocation method. The approximate solution of the problem (1), (2) will still be searched in the form (4). Unknown coefficients {αk} n+m m are determined by the method of the location from the conditions: (k xn) (t j) = y (t j), j = 0, n, where {t j} nj = 0 ⊂ [−1,1] - - Some system of different points. These conditions are relatively {αk} n +m m give a sludge (5), where γk j = (k (t +1) k) (t j), y j = y (t j). (7) in spaces
