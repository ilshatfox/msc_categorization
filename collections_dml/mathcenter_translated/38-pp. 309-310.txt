The solution to the problem of restoring functions using the Lyandra polynomas let the function J (x) e c [-1, j] is set by its attachment J'0 (x) in the mid-constriction of metric. It is required by F 0 (X) to build uniform approaches to F (X). This problem is solved similarly to [IJ. Put the functions j (x) in line with a number of Fourier - Lyindra [2] 00 i: akpk (x) k = o and denote a partial amount through SN. Theorem.
