The work conducts a study of the 6-dimensional pseudoriman space V 6 (GI J) with a signature [++ --–--] of a special type, which allows non-metothetic infinitezimal projective transformations. Recall that the transformation F of Pseudorimanov’s diversity M is called a projective transformation if it converts geodetic lines into geodetic lines. The vector field X is called an infinitezimal projective transformation or projective movement, if the local single -parametric group of transformations generated by this field in the vicinity of each point p ∈ M, consists of local projective transformations. Vector field X is an infinitezimal projective transformation on diversity m with affinity ∇ when and only when [1] ∇y (lx z ∇x z) - (lx - ∇x) ∇y z = r (x, y) z - wor (y) z —Y ∗ (z), for the 1-form С ϕ form and all vector fields y, z on m, where R is the curvature tensor. If M is the pseudorimano diversity with the metric G and riman coherence ∇, then the last condition is equivalent to two equations (see [1] and [2]): lx g = h, ∇h (y, z, w) = 2g (y, Z) wll+ g (y, w) z accord (z, w) y ng, 150 materials of the school-conference where l is the derivative, (y, z, w) ∈ T (m), ship ll = 1n+ 1 Divx. The first equation is called the generalized equation of Killing, the second equation is called the Eisenhart equation. In local coordinates, these equations are recorded in the form of lisingi j = lection, j + onic j, i = hi j, hi j, k = 2gi japer, k + gi k pul, j + g j k accord, where a comma means a cowaling derivative, ă - Vector field setting projective movement. Pseudoriman variety for which there are non-trivial solutions hi j ̸ = cgi j of Eisenhart equations (see [1]) are called H-spaces. To find a pseudoriman space that allows non -metothetic infinitezimal projective transformations, Eisenhart’s equation must first be interpreted. The task of determining such spaces depends on the type of bilinear form LX G, determined by the characteristic of the segraλ-matrix (h-λg). If the characteristic of the tensor LX G is [ABC ...], then the corresponding space is called the H-space type [ABC ...]. Earlier in the works [3], [4] and [5], a solution to the Eisenhart equation was found in the case of H-space type [2211] and it was proved that all projective movements in the considered space of inconsistent curvature are obtained by integrating the equations Lisingi J = ₽, J + + ă j, i = a1ai j + (a1 6∑ k = 1 fk + a2) gi j, (1) where the AI ​​J, Gi J and FK functions are found in [5], A1, A2 - constant. In this work, the study of the 6-dimensional H-space type [2211] is continued, namely, the following lemma is proved. If the infinitely small transformation is XI ′ = XI + lection is a non-tetical projective movement in the H-consumption of the type [2211] of inconsistent curvature, then the components μ1 (x1, x2), ₽ (x2), cil (x3, x4), cil (x4 ), ă5 (x5), lection (x6) of the vector field hole, which sets the projective movement, are the functions of these variables. To prove this lemma, those Killing equations (1) were written out and interpreted, in which the right parts are zero by zero by zero of the tensures ai j and gi j. These equations are differential equations in private derivatives. Also, to prove the lemma, the conditions for the integrationality of the generalized Killing equations of the Killing lising I j kl = ă h∂hr i j kl --r h j kl∂h i +r ihkl∂ j +r ij h +r i ij kh∂lun h = Δil accordal , k j - δ i k accord, l J, in which (i j kl), different values ​​were given alternately. In the future, using this lemma, it is possible to integrate the remaining Killing equations, in which the right parts are equal to the non -equal values ​​of the AI ​​J and Gi J tensors. Thus, the task of restoring the vector field that determines infinitezimal projective transformation in the space under consideration
