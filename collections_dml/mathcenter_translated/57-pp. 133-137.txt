We study one-parametric families of planar ring domains whose complements are linear segments and establish a formula for variation of their moduli in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic functions. We also obtain a system of ODEs to find parameters in the integral representation of functions realizing conformal mappings of annuli onto the domains of the family.  Keywords: conformal module, capacity, elliptic functions.  1. Introduction. The Weierstrass and Jacobian elliptic and theta functions and the Schwarz-Christoffel formula form the foundation for numerous explicit formulas for conformal mappings. During the past thirty years many authors have studied numerical implementation of conformal mappings (see the bibliography in [13]). In particular, the Schwarz-Christoffel toolbox of T. Driscoll and N. Trefethen [4] has become a standard tool in the field. In a series of papers of T. DeLillo, J. Pfaltzgraff, D. Crowdy and their coauthors have extended the Schwarz-Christoffel method to certain cases of multiply connected domains with polygonal boundary components.  In addition to the conformal mapping problem, also the computation of numerical values of conformal invariants is an important issue in geometric function theory. Here one can often use a conformal map onto a canonical domain so as to simplify the computation. Therefore, computation of conformal invariants has a natural link to numerical conformal mapping.  A basic conformal invariant is the module of a ring domain. A ring domain G can be conformally mapped onto an annulus {z ∈ C : q < |z| < 1} and its conformal module and capacity are defined as modG = (log(q−1))/(2π) , capG = 2π/log(q−1) . Therefore, modG = 1/capG and the computation of modG can be reduced to the solution of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation and to the computation of the L2-norm of its gradient. This method was applied in [2, 6, 7] for the case of bounded ring domains.  Here we shall consider unbounded ring domains whose complementary components are segments. To find their modules approximately, we describe one-parametric families of functions f (z, t ) each of which maps conformally an annulus {q < |ζ| < 1} onto the exterior G =G(t ) of two disjoint segments A1 A2 and A3 A4. Here A j = A j (t ), 1 ≤ j ≤ 4, are some smooth functions and q = q(t ); t is a real parameter. We will denote such domains by G(A1, A2, A3, A4). It is also assumed that the straight lines, containing the segments A1 A2 and A3 A4, are fixed.  We note that one-parametric families of conformal mappings were considered earlier. There is the well-known Loewner-Komatu differential equation which is a generalization of the Loewner equation to the doubly-connected case. The approach of Komatu was developed by Goluzin [5] and others (see, e.g. [1]).  We deduce a differential equation for f (z, t ) in the considered case (Theorem 2). In    134 МАТЕРИАЛЫ ШКОЛЫ-КОНФЕРЕНЦИИ  contrast to the Loewner-Komatu equation, we do not assume that the family of the images is monotonic as a function of the parameter t . As a corollary, we obtain a system of ODEs to determine the behavior of the accessory parameters, which are the preimages of the points A j , and the conformal module m(t ) := modG(t ) = (log(q(t ))−1)/(2π) (Theorem 3). On the base of the system, we can suggest an approximate method for finding the accessory parameters and the conformal module. It is based on the solving of the Cauchy problem for system of ODEs from Theorem 3 (see more in [3]).  2. Integral representation. Consider a conformal mapping g of an annulus {q < |ζ| < 1} onto the exterior G = G(A1, A2, A3, A4) of two disjoint rectilinear slits A1 A2 and A3 A4 in the w-plane. With the help of the exponential map z 7→ ζ = exp(2πi z) we can consider the map f := g (2πi z) from the horizontal strip S := {−m < ℑz < 0}, m =  1 2π log(q  −1), onto G. It maps conformally the rectangle Π = {0 < ℜz < 1, −m < ℑz < 0} with identified vertical sides onto G (Fig. 1). The value m is the conformal module of G. It is evident that f has a unique pole z̄0 in Π. Using the Riemann–Schwarz reflection principle, we can extend f to C as a meromorphic function.  We will find an integral representation for the conformal mapping f of Schwarz– Christoffel type using the Weierstrass σ-function. We should note that analogs of the Schwarz–Christoffel integral for doubly-connected domains were obtained earlier in [9]; it is based on θ-functions.  Fig. 1.
