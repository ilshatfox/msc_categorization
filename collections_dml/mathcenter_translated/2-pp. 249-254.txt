The diverse method of solving the problem of saturated filtration consolidation The process of filtration consolidation with complete saturation can be described by a system of differential equations (see [1], [2]), consisting of: - the equations of the quasi -equalization of the environment as a whole: divσf - ∇ p = f, (1 ) - the conditions for joint deformation of the phase η (Divu) ∂t + Div Q = 0, (2) - the Law of Darcy q = - (∇p - G̃), (3) 249 - the rheological ratio σf = Divu · δ + 2 ε 2 ε 2 ε 2 (u) + 2µ ε (∂u ∂t), (4) where σf is the tensor of effective stresses, U is the vector of displacements of the elastic environment, p is pore pressure, q is the speed of filter, δ is a single tensor, ε (u) , ε (∂u ∂t) - tensor of deformations and their speeds, respectively, η, µ - specified parameters, f, g̃ - specified vector -function. The task (1) - (4) will be considered in the limited area ω̄ = {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 | - 1 ≤ x1 ≤ 1, −1 ≤ x2 ≤ 0}. Let γ - border ω, γ1 - part γ, determined by equality | x1 | = 1, γ2 - many points γ, for which x2 = −1, γ3 = {(x1, x2) ∈ γ | x2 = 0, | x1 | ≤ a1 <1}, γ4 - the remaining part γ. We will assume that ui (x, t) = 0, x ∈ γ1 ∪ γ2; (5) σ F 12 = 0, x ∈ γ3 ∪ γ4; −σ F 22 + p = {0, x ∈ γ4, f (t), x ∈ γ3; (6) q1 (x, t) = 0, x ∈ γ1; q2 (x, t) = 0, x ∈ γ2; p (x, t) = 0, x ∈ γ4, (7) f (t) - a given function that simulates the effect of the load on the layer. On γ3 we will consider the boundary conditions of the two types: p (x, t) = 0, x ∈ γ3, (8) q2 (x, t) = 0, x ∈ γ3. (9) The task (1) - (9) can be represented by the following operator equations: lu + µl1 ∂u ∂t + c p = f, (10) − CT ∂u ∂t - ∆ p = 0. (11) 250 ∆ - Laplace operator acting from ° V 1 → (° V 1) ∗, Ope Rator L1: ° V × ° V → (° V × °) and C: ° V 1 → L2 (ω ) × l2 (ω) are determined by the ratios: << lu, v >> = 2∑ i, j = 1 ∫ ω (divu · δij + 2 εij (u)) ∂vi ∂xj dx, << l1u, v >>> = 2∑ i, j = 1 ∫ ω 2 εij (∂u ∂t) ∂vi ∂xj dx, (cp, v) = 2∑ i = 1 ∫ ω p ∂vi ∂xi dx, where ° V is the closure of the set smooth functions equal to zero on γ1 ∪ γ2 normally space W 12 (ω), ° V 1 - the closure of multi -names of smooth functions in the norm of the same space equal to zero on γ3∪γ4 (for the task (1) - (4), (5) - (8)) and equal to zero on γ4 (for the task (1) - (4), (5) - (7), (9)), << U, v >> - the ratio of twice between the spaces ® V × ° V and (° V × ® v), A (U, V) - a scalar product in the space L2 (ω) × L2 (ω). What difficulties can arise when constructing close methods of solving the problem under consideration, it is convenient to explain using the example of constructing an iteration method to solve a semi -disciplress problem with sampling only by a temporary variable. The solution of this problem will call the function y1 (t), y2 (t) ∈ ° v, pτ (t) ∈ ° v 1 ∀t ∈t ∈ ωτ = {t ∈ [0, T] | t = kτ, 0 ≤ k ≤m}, satisfying equations: l ŷ + µl1 ŷ - y τ + c p̂τ = f, (12) − ct ŷ - y τ - ∆ p̂τ = 0. (13) from the system of equations (12), (13), using the equality ŷ - y τ = (τl+ µl1) −1 [—cp̂τ+ f - le], 251 is a direct consequence of the equation (12), it is easy to obtain the equation relative to p̂τ: η ct (τl+ µl1 ) −1 c p̂τ - ∆ p̂τ = = η ct (τl+ µl1) −1 f - η ct (τl+ µl1) −1 ly. (14) From (14) it is clear that when constructing an iterative method of solving the problem, the properties of the operator CT (τl+µl1) −1c should be taken into account. Using the well -known result of the linear theory of elasticity (see, e.g., [3]) on the energy equivalence of operators L and L1 to the Laplass operator and the assessment: γ̃1e ≤ c∆−1CT ≤ γ̃2e, which is often called the BBL inequality [4, 5] , it is easy to show that the CT (τl + µl1) −1C operator is energetically equivalent to a single operator, namely, there is an assessment γ1 τ + µ e ≤ ct (τl + µl1) −1c ≤ γ2 τ + µ E, (15) here γi - Positive constants beyond τ and µ. Obviously, in (15) the constant equivalence of operators at µ = 0 (in the absence of viscosity in the rheological ratio), they increase unlimited at τ → 0, with small values ​​of the µ parameter, they are simply very large. Therefore, to solve a semi -discrete problem, it is advisable to use the following iteration process: b PN + 1 - PN τ ∗ + APN = F̃, (16) where B = ∆ + ω τ + µ E, ω = const> 0, A = η ct ( τl+ µl1) −1 - ∆. It is clear that the operator B will be energetically equivalent to the operator A with the equivalence constants that do not depend on τ with µ = 0. The constant τ ∗ is selected for considerations of the optimality of the process. 252 For a discrete task, it is advisable to build ITERATIONAL METHODS Type (16). In this case, it is necessary that the CTH (τlh + µl1h) −1CH operator retains the property (15), which is ensured, how easy it is to see, the validity of the BBL inequality for operators –∆H and ch. It is known (see [6, 7]) that this inequality occurs, for example, for MKE schemes built as of the following rule: let T and T ′ - two breakdown of the area ω into triangles, and such that each final element from T Contains four triangles from T ′, obtained by the breakdown of the first straight, drawn through the middle of the parties.
