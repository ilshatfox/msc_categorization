Magomedova2 1 AR-RAMAZANOV@rambler.ru; Dagestan State University, Dagestan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences 2 vazipat@rambler.ru; Dagestan State University for continuous and continuously differentiated (to second -order) functions obtained assessments of the speed of convergence of the splashes for three -point rational interpolarians, expressed through the continuity module and the change module. Keywords: splashes, interpolation spears, rational splashes. For the mesh of the nodes ∆: a = x0 <x1 <·, · <xn = b (n ê 2), we put Hi = XI - XI-1 (I = 1.2,., N), ∆I = max { hi -1, hi, hi+1} (i = 2.3,., N - 1), ∆1 = max {h1, h2}, ∆n = max {hn - 1, hn}, ∥∆ ∥ = max {hi | i = 1.2 ,. . . , N}. For f ∈C [a, b], we consider the rational functions Ri (x) = αi + βi (x −xi) + γi x - gi with the conditions of Ri (x j) = f (x j) for j = i - 1, i, I + 1 and an arbitrary point gi ̸∈ [XI - 1, XI + 1] (I = 1.2,., N - 1); Below we will consider R0 (x) ≡ R1 (x), rn (x) ≡ rn -1 (x), g = {g1, g2 ,. . . , gn -1}. Then with each k = 1.2 ,. . . We receive ([1]) a piece -rational function rn, k (x) = rn, k (x, f, ∆, g) from class C (k) [a, b], for which at x ∈ [XI-1 , XI] (I = 1.2,., N) is equal to rn, k (x) = ri (x) (x −xi - 1) k +ri -1 (x) (XI −X) K (x −xi - 1) k + (XI −X) K. Note that if the function F (x) is convex or concave on the segment [XI - 1, XI+1] with some I = 1.2 ,. . . , N - 1, then the interpolarian Ri (X) is also respectively convex or concave function on this segment. The splashes rn, k (x) with k ê 2 retain the bulge (concave) of the function f (x) in some vicinences of the mesh nodes ∆. As follows from the statements below, the smooth rational sessions of Rn, K (X) themselves (unlike smooth polynomial splashes) and their derivatives have the property of unconditional convergence on the corresponding classes of continuous and continuously differentiated functions (according to the terminology of Yu.N. Subbotin [2 ]). Moreover, for the functions from the classes C [a, b] and C (1) [a, b] the next statement gives an assessment of the rate of convergence through the continuity of the function and its derivative. Theorem 1. Let for the mesh of the nodes ∆: a = x0 <x1 <·, · · · <xn = b (n ê 2) and an arbitrary number λ> 0 selected the numbers g = {g1, g2,. . . , gn -1} is such that gi = xi+1+λhi+1 with hi+1 é hi and gi = xi-1 --λhi with hi+1> hi (i = 1.2,., N - n - n - n - n - n - n - one). Then for any F ∈C [A, B] and, A.-P. Ramazanov, V.G. Magomedova 305 separately, for any f ∈C (1) [a, b] and the corresponding scales rn, k (x) = rn, k (x, f, ∆, g) (k ê 1) for x ∈ [xi- 1, XI] (I = 1.2,., N) inequalities are performed according to | f (x) −rn, k (x) | É (2+max {1, λ}) ω (∆I, f), | f ′ (x) −r ′ n, k (x) | É (4 + 8k + 2 λ) ω (∆I, f ′). In the case of class C (2) [a, b] there is a theorem 2. Let the sequence of the mesh of the nodes ∆ (n): a = x (n) 0 <x (n) 1 <· · · <x (n) n) = b (n = 2.3,...) With a diameter of ∥∆ (n) ∥ → 0 for n → urb. Then there is a sequence of sets of numbers g (n) = {g (n) 1, g (n) 2 ,. . . , g (n) n -1} (n = 2.3,..) Such that for any f ∈C (2) [a, b] the sequence of second -order derivatives of the corresponding rational altogether R ′ ′ n, 2 ( x, f, ∆ (n), g (n)) evenly converges to f ′ ′ (x) on the segment [a, b]. С безусловной сходимостью связано также следующее утверждение, в котором оценка скорости сходимости дана через модуль изменения порядка N функции f ∈ C[a,b], который определяется (см., напр., [3]) равенством  VN ( f , [a, b]) = sup n∑ i = 1 | F (βi) - ​​f (αi) | where the Supremum is taken with fixed n at all points α1 <β1 α2 <β2 · · · · ééαn <βn from the segment [a, b]. Theorem 3. If f ∈ C [a, b], then with any natural n ê 2 there is a mesh of nodes ∆: a = x0 <x1 <· · · · <xn = b and the number g = {g1, g2 ,. . . , gn -1} such that for the spade rn, k (x) = rn, k (x, f, ∆, g) (k ê 1) for x ∈ [a, b] we have | f (x) −rn, k (x) | É 3 n vn (f, [a, b]). As can be seen from the following two statements, the assessment in them in the case of functions with derivatives (respectively of the first and second orders) of the final variation have the procedure for convergence of the best polynomial alcohols ([4]). Theorem 4. If f ∈C (1) [a, b], then with any λ> 0 and natural n exists a mesh of nodes ∆: a = x0 <·, · · · · · · b s n é 2n and numbers g = {g1, g2 ,. . . , gn -1} such that the spark rn, k (x) = rn, k (x, f, ∆, g) (k ê 1) for all x ∈ [a, b] satisfies inequality | f (x) −rn, k (x) | É (2+ 1 λ) b —a n2 vn (f ′, [a, b]). Theorem 5. If f ∈ C (2) [a, b], then with any natural n exists a grid of nodes ∆: a = x0 <x1 <· · · · · · · b s n é 2n, for which with any choice of numbers 306 Materials of the International School-Conference G = {G1, G2 ,. . . , gn -1} with gi ̸∈ [XI - 1, XI+1] (I = 1.2,., N −1) the splane rn, k (x) = rn, k (x, f, ∆ , g) (k ê 1) satisfies inequality | f (x) −rn, k (x) | É (b —a) 2 4n3 vn (f ′ ′, [a, b])+ (b —a) 3 4 4µn3 ∥ f ′ ′ ∥ [a, b], where µ = min {| XI -1 - gi |, | XI+1 - GI | :
