) The end-and-character method for the system of equations of one-dimensional motion of viscous electrical gas in Euler variables in the one-dimensional movement of the viscous electrical gas is reduced to the system of differential equations of magnetic hydrodynamics in Euler variables: ∂ρ ∂t + ∂ρv ∂x = 0, (1.1) ρ (∂V ∂T + v ∂V ∂X) + ∂P ∂X = 4 3 µ ∂2V ∂x2 + fx, (1.2) ρ (∂u ∂t + v ∂u ∂x) = µ ∂2u ∂x2 + fy, (1.3) ρ (∂w ∂t + v ∂w ∂x) = µ ∂2W ∂x2 + fz, (1.4) hx = hx0 = const, ∂hy ∂t + ∂ (vhy) ∂x = hx ∂u ∂x + 1 4πσ ∂2hy ∂x2, (1.5) ∂hz ∂t + ∂ (vhz) ∂x = hx ∂w ∂x + 1 4πσ ∂2hz ∂x2, (1.6) fx = - ∂ ∂x ( H2y +h 2 z 8π), 210 fy = hx 4π ∂hy ∂x, fz = hx 4π ∂hz ∂x. The desired values: (V, U, W) - speed vector, (HX, HY, HZ) - vector of magnetic field tension, ρ - density. All of the desired values ​​are the functions of Eler's variables (t, x), where t is time, x is one -dimensional spatial coordinate. The task is considered in the area q = [0, t] × [0, x]. Known values: µ = const - viscosity, σ = const - electrical conductivity; as well as the given function p = p (ρ). Border conditions: V (t, 0) = V (t, x) = 0, u (t, 0) = u (t, x) = 0, w (t, 0) = w (t, x) = 0 , Hy (t, 0) = Hy0, Hy (T, X) = HY1, Hz (T, 0) = HZ0, Hz (T, X) = HZ1. Initial conditions: v (0, x) = v0 (x), u (0, x) = u0 (x), w (0, x) = w0 (x), ρ (0, x) = ρ0 (x) , Hy (0, x) = h 0 y (x), hz (0, x) = h 0 z (x). Suppose the fulfillment of the following conditions: 1) there is the only classic solution to the problem (1.1) - (1.6); 2) ρ, V, U, W, Hy, Hz ∈ C4.2 (Q); 3) ρ (t, x) ≥ m> 0, (t, x) ∈ Q; 4) p (ρ) ∈ C2 in the area ρ> 0. Pour the uniform mesh Qτ, H in the area Q = [0, T] × [0, X], consisting of nodes (tj, xi), 0 ≤ i ≤ n, 0 ≤ j ≤ m, where tj = jτ, xi = Ih, x = hn, t = τm. The value of the grid function U at the point (TJ, XI) will designate u j i. If the indices of the function are lowered, we believe that they are equal (J, I). We will also use the designations u j+1 i = û, u j ± 1 = u (± 1). Let R, X, Y, Z, A, B - net analogues of functions ρ, V, U, W, Hy, Hz. We will consider the diverse scheme: r (xt +xxẋ) +p (r) ẋ = 4 3 µx̂xx̄ - 1 4π (aaẋ +bbẋ), (2.1) r (yt +xyẋ) = µŷxx̄ +hx0 4π aẋ, (2.2) r. (Zt +xzẋ) = µẑxx̄ +hx0 4π bẋ, (2.3) at +xaẋ +xẋa = hx0ŷẋ +1 4πσ âxx̄, (2.4) 211 bt +xbẋ +xẋb = hx0ẑẋ +1 4πσ b̂xx̄, (2.5) RT +1 2 2 2 2 2 2 ((R̂x̂) ẋ + x̂r̂ẋ + rx̂ẋ) = 0 with i = 1,. . . , N - 1, (2.6) rt, 0 + 1 2 ((r̂x̂) x, 0 + r0x̂x, 0 –h 2 (r1x̂xx̄, 1 + (rx̂) xx̄, 1)) = 0, rt, n + 1 2 2 2 2 2 ((R̂ẑ) x̄, n + rn x̂x̄, n + h 2 (rn --1x̂xx̄, n - 1 + (rx̂) xx̄, n - 1)) = 0. The boundary and initial conditions are determined by projections on the grid of the specified functions: (r X, y, z, a, b) | j = 0 = (ρ0, v0, u0, w0, h0y, h0z), a | i = 0 = hy0, a | i = n = hy1, b | i = 0 = hz0, b | i = n = hz1, (x, y, z) | i = 0, n = (0, 0, 0). With fixed j (2.1) - (2.6), they make up six systems of linear equations regarding the desired functions on the layer (J+1). These systems are permitted, because For systems (2.1) - (2.5) their matrices are three -dyagonal with diagonal predominance, and for the system (2.6) its matrix is ​​represented in the form of the amount of oblique and single. Such matrices are unknown. We introduce the designation for the sum of the net norms of the difference between the projection of the exact solution on the Qτ, H and the variety solution on the JM time layer in the net norm of the space w 12: lj = || ρj −rj || 12 + || vj −xj || 12 + || uj - y j || 12 + || Wj - zj || 12+ + || Hmy —Aj || 12 + || Hmz −bj || 12. We denote through ε0 an error of rounding the initial conditions: (ε0) 2 = L0. 212 using the method stated in [2], the following theorem was proved. Let the conditions 1-4 are fulfilled for the differential task (1.1)-(1.6). Then there are values ​​of τmax, hmax, ε 0 max and C such that with τ ≤ τmax, h ≤ hmax and ε0 ≤ ε0max, an assessment is made for mepthe standards of the difference between the projection of the exact solution of the differential problem on the Qτ, H and the variable solution: lm + τ m∑ k = 1 || (vk −xk) xx̄ || 2 + || (uk - y k) xx̄ || 2 + || (wk - zk) xx̄ || 2+ || (hky —Ak) xx̄ || 2 + || (hkz −bk) xx̄ || 2 ≤ c (τ + h2 + ε0). The values ​​of τmax, hmax, ε 0 max and C depend only on the parametes of the differential task. It can also be noted that τ and h do not depend on each other. Literature [1] Samara A.A., Popov Yu.P.
