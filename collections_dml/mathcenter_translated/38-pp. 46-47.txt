The double projectors and characterization of the trace on algebra von Neumann let algebra von Neumanm act in the Hilbert space N. through M+ and MPR, we denote it to put the body and lattice of the projectors, respectively. Let M: - the cone of positive normal functionals on m, e - unit m, sr (x) - the carrier of the element x e l1+. The display is called the display <p: m+ -> [o,+oo], such that <p (x+y) = ip (x)+ip (y), cr (lx) = l <p. (x), x, ym+, l ~ o, o · oo =: ​​about. The weight <p n / ltf is called normal if <p (x) = supip (XI), XI / X, XI, X EM+; Kon'chn'ym, if <p (c) < +oo; Next, if <p (x*x) = <p (xx*), x e m. The weight <r continues correctly in linearness to the functionality on M'r = lin {x e jvf +: ip (x) < + + oo}. This continuation allows you to identify the final weight with positive functionality on LT/. The weight of R.P on the algebra von Neuman M is then and only when I.p (x112px112) = <p (pchr) for all x e m+ and r e mp ([1], [2]). In particular, <p is a trace if <p (x1f2yx1f2) = IP (ylf2xy112) for all x, u m+. Theorem 1 (11], [2]). Let the weight <p on the algebra von Neumanm satisfies the convention 11 · 11 x11 ---> x, hp / x :::::::: into the (:} <p (x) =) Im <p (hp), hp, xe me m +. (1) 1t-+OO A.M. Bicchentaev 47 then t.p - trace <===> ip (pqp) = <p (qpq) dl1 all p, q e mvr. Theorem 1 found applications in the theory of splitting under the spaces [3J. Semi -intake from below, according to the rate of weight, satisfy the condition (1); These are, in particular, normal or final weights. For r, q e MR "three equations PQP = qpq, sr (pqp) = sr (qpq) and pq = qp are equivalent [4]. Theorem 2. Weight t.p n, and algebra von, Neumann M is the following {== ? <p ((PQR)*(PQR)) = T.P ((PQR) (PQR)*) for all P, Q, R E MR "'. Theorem 3. Functionality T.P E M: is followed {==? T.P (AR (PQP)) = IP (sr (qpq)) for all p, q e mpr. Literature 1. Bicentaev a.
