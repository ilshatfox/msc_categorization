Materials of the International School-Conference of UDC 517.5 Infinitely tensor works and convergence almost everywhere D.V. Fufaev1 1 fufaevdv@rambler.ru; Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics presented the results on the summation of the Fourier ranks on an infinite-measures, as well as a generalization for the case of abstract spaces with a measure. Key words: rows of Fourier, tensor work, convergence almost everywhere. Infinite Torah Tor Tire is called the Cartesian number of one -dimensional Torah Tor T. On TUs, a system of functions called the Yessen system: θn1, ..., np (x) = p∏ r = 1 e2πi nr XR, where p ∈N, nr ∈Z, X = (X1,., XP,..) ∈T least, generalizing the trigonometric system to the estimated number of variables. Consider the partial amounts of the Fourier of the Fourier Functions F ∈ L (TU) according to this system, presented in the form of SP, N1 ..., NP (x) = n1∑ k1 = · · · · np∑ kp = −np ck1,. .., kp e 2πi (k1x1+·.,+kp xp). Through σp, N1 ..., NP (x), we denote the average arithmetic of the partial sums of this row, which we will call the average fireworks. Let's say that they converge in an enhanced sense if for each p ∈ N converges (as multiple rows) to σp rows σp, n1 ..., NP and there is the final limit of their sums: lim p → gerσp. Let Tives = D∏ L = 1 TML, where D, ml ∈N∪ {ger}. We denote through P L the projector to the corresponding subspace of coordinates. We call multi-core n = (n1,., NP) increasing limited if max 1≤i, j≤p ni n j ≤ l <mm, min 1≤i≤p ni → φ, and increasing D-limit, if everything P l (n), l = 1 ,. . . , D, increase limited. D-limit, in the case of the counting number of variables, is understood as a D-limiting convergence of the rows σp, N1 ..., NP for each p ∈N. Theorem. Let F ∈ D -1 l = 0 L (log+l) r (t edge). Then the average fireworks of functions F converge D-limiting in the enhanced sense to F almost everywhere on Tux. With d = 1, we obtain a limited convergence (generalization of convergence by cubes), with d = φ - a variant of convergence according to the pringsheim (by rectangles). It will be natural to summarize these results for the case of abstract spaces. Let (x k, µk), k ∈N - spaces with a measure, and µk (x k) = 1. Let now for each k ∈N set the sequence of operators {t k nk}, porous l1 (x k, µk) In itself, and in each sequence there is a “zero” trivial integration operator: T K 0k F = IX K (F) = ´ x K f (x) dµk (x) for any d.V. Fufaev 381 functions f ∈ L1 (x k, µk). From scattered spaces of functions and operators, we need to go to the functions set on the work of spaces. Let f 1 ∈ L1 (x 1, µ1), f 2 ∈ L1 (x 2, µ2), then their tensor work is called the function f 1⊗ f 2 ∈ L1 (x 1 × x 2, µ1⊗µ2), determined by Formula F 1⊗ F 2 (X1, X2) = F 1 (X1) F 2 (X2), where micro µ2 is a product of measures midwives. Such functions are called elementary tensors. The algebraic tensor work L1 (x 1, µ1) and L1 (x 2, µ2) is called the space of linear combinations of elementary tensors and is indicated by L1 (x 1, µ1) ⊗L1 (x 2, µ2). The projective tensor work designated by L1 (x 1, µ1) ⊗̂L1 (x 2, µ2) is called the replenishment of algebraic by the so -called projective norm ([1], 0.3.28), it isometrically isomorphic L1 (x 1 × x 2, µ1 ⊗µ2) ([1], consequence 0.3.36). Further, if the continuous linear operators T I translate L1 (x I, µi) into themselves, I = 1.2, then there is the only continuous linear operator T 1 ⊗̂T 2, called the tensor work of the operators, translating L1 (x 1, µ1 ) ⊗̂ l1 (x 2, µ2) in itself, such that on elementary tenshores it acts according to the formula: t 1 ⊗̂t 2 [f · g] (x, y) = t 1 f (x) t 2g ( y) ([1], theorem 0.3.40). We assume that the tensor work of the infinite number of trivial operators is a trivial operator, that is, that ⊗̂ k≥ j t k 0k = i ∏ k≥ j x k k x k for any J ∈N. Then we can determine the endless work of operators, only the final number of which is excellent from the trivial: t 1 n1 ⊗̂. . .⊗̂t p np ⊗̂t p+1 0p+1 ⊗̂ · · · = t 1 n1 ⊗̂. . . ⊗̂ t p np ⊗̂ i ∏ k≥p+1 x k for any p ∈ N.

Theorem. Let (x k, µk), k ∈ N - spaces with a measure, µk (x k) = 1, for each k ∈N, the sequence of operators {t k nk} is set, translating l1 (x k, µk) into itself Each of which has a “zero” element, then a) if for any p ∈N and any function f ∈ L1 (p∏ k = 1 x k, p⊗ k = 1 µK) is performed ⊗̂ 1≤k≤p t k nk nk F → F with min K = 1, ..., p nk → ger p⊗ k = 1 µk-read everywhere, then for any function f ∈ L1 (ger∏ k = 1 x k, ger⊗ k = 1 µk) It is true that ⊗̂ 1≤k≤inger t k nk F converges φ⊗ k = 1 µk-mail everywhere to f; b) if for any p ∈ N and any function f ∈ L (ln+l) p - 1 (p∏ k = 1 x k, p⊗ k = 1 µk) performed ⊗̂ 1≤k≤p t k nk F → F with min K = 1, ..., p nk → ger p⊗ k = 1 µk-read everywhere, then for any function f ∈⋂ R = 1 l (ln+l) r (φ∏ k = 1 x k, φ⊗ k = 1 µ
