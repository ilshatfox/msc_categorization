Materials of the Youth School-Conference in the coefficients of equation (2) of additional properties of a smooth -ocal nature The rate of convergence of the found approaches to the exact solution increases. The latter follows from the same result of the approximation of the features of algebraic polynomas in the spaces of gelder functions (see, for example, [3]). Literature 1. Samos.

On the Cauchy Problem for An Ordinary Differential Equation with A FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVATIVE IN THE PRINCIPAL PART J.R. Agachev, A.V. Guskova  The article studies the Cauchy problem for a class of linear ordinary differential equations with fractional derivative in the main part, in the case when known coefficients of the equation belong to the class of Holder.

UDC 517.968 On the correct setting of the general regional task for the conditionally correct integro-radio-different equations of Fredgolm-Volterra Yu.R. Agachev1, M.Yu.

Lobachevsky 2 mpershagin@mail.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky in the work studies a general regional task for linear integro-radio-radio equations of Fredgolm-Waterra, set on the segment of the numerical straight line, in which the order of the internal differential operator is above the order of the corresponding external differential operator. The correct setting of this task is proved in the sense of Adamar in the specially selected pair of Sobolev’s weightless spaces. Keywords: Sobolev space, integro-reduced equation, general marginal task, correct production. Yu.R. Agachev, M.Yu. Pershagin 13 in this work continues studies that began in [1]. The general regional task of Ri (x) = 0, i = 0, m −1, (1) for the integro-differential equation K x ≡ x (t)+ m∑ i = 1 γi (m (t) x (m (m) is considered −i) (t) + + p∑ j = 0   b∫ a h j (t, s) x (j) (s) d s + t∫ a g j (t, s) x (j) (s) d s    = y (t), a ≤ t ≤ b. (2) here Ri, I = 0, M −1,-specified by linear-dependent functional, determined on the subspace C (M-1) [a, b] (m-1)-once continuous-differentiated on [a, b ] functions (c [a, b] ≡c (0) [a, b]), γi (t), i = 1, m, h j (t, s), g j (t, s), j = 0, P, - known functions in their areas of definition, x (t) - the desired function. The integer parameters M, P satisfy the condition p> m ≥ 0, which entails, according to the classification of B.G. Gabdulkhaev [2], conditional correctness of the task (1), (2). This means that (1), (2) can be set correctly by Adamar with certain smooth -ocated properties of the coefficients of the equation (2). Through W Q L2 ≡ W Q L2 [A, B], Q ∈ N, we denote the space of functions that have a derivative of the L2 space of the quadratic functions on [a, b]. We set the norm in this space in the usual way: ∥ accord, 2 = ∥ accord (q) ∥∥∥ l2 (onic ∈W q l2). (3) The task (1), (2) will be considered in a pair of spaces1 (x, y), where the space of the right parts y = w p --ml2, the space of the desired elements X consists of functions belonging to w l2 and satisfying the regional conditions (1 ). In space X, we agree with the norm with the norm in Y ((3) with Q = p −m) according to the formula: ∥x∥x = ∥∥∥x (m) ∥∥∥ l2 + ∥∥∥x (p) ∥∥∥ ∥∥∥ L2 ≡ ∥∥∥x (m) ∥∥∥ y. With the norms of space X and Y, in this way, are complete. In a pair (x, y), the task (1), (2) can be represented in the form of the operator equation k x ≡ dx +γx +h x +gx = y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y), (4) where operators are operators D, γ, h, g are set by the formulas: (dx) (t) ≡ x (m) (t), (γx) (t) ≡ m∑ i = 1 γi (t) x (m --i) (t) , (H x) (t) ≡ p∑ j = 0 b∫ a h j (t, s) x (j) (s) d s, (gx) (t) ≡ p∑ j = 0 t∫ a g j (t, s ) x (j) (s) d s. 1 For this, it is necessary to impose on the known functions some conditions of a smooth -ocal nature. 14 Materials of the Youth School-Conference note that the operator D: X → Y is continuously turn, and ∥d∥x → y = ∥d-1∥y → X = 1. Lemma 1 (see [1]). Let the assumptions be made: 1) γi ∈ Y, i = 1, m; 2) H J ∈ Y × L1, J = 0, P −1; 3) hp ∈ Y × L2. Then the operator γ+h: x → y is quite continuous. Next, we introduce the function ψ j, k (t) ≡ k ∂t k g j (t, s) | s = t, k = 0, p −m −1, j = 0, p.
