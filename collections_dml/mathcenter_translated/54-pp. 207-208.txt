. Integral Operator with Kernel Having Jumps on Broken Lines O.A. Koroleva  We study equiconvergence expansions in trigonometric Fourier series and series by eigenfunctions and associated functions of an integral operator whose kernel has jumps at the sides of a square inscribed in the unit square. Keywords: Equiconvergence, Resolvent, Characteristic Number, Eigenfunctions and Associated Functions. UDC 517.934+517.92: 62-50 On the stability of solving the equations of Navier-Koksa P.A. Kotov1 1 Petercotov@yandex.ru; Voronezh State University, Voronezh considers the hydrodynamic task of the unstoppable of the unexplored low-consuming fluid with limited measurable regional conditions and the substantial aspects of the stability of solving the material system of the Nastye-Khoks equations from the class of smooth-winging at the infinity of functions are offered. Keywords: the unsettled course of an inconsistent non -magnetic fluid, real zero boundary conditions. The hydrodynamic task is considered about the unsettled course of the uninvited fluid with disabilities with limited measuring regional regional 208 materials of the International School-Conference conditions and the substantial aspects of stability of solving the material system of Nastye-stroke equations from the class of smooth decoration at the infinity of functions are proposed. Let the material system of the equations of the unidentified course of an inconsistent with a small liquid seem to be the initial system of equations [1, 2] ρ ∂u ∂t +ρ∂u ∂x u +∂u ∂y v +ρ∂u ∂z w = x - ∂p ∂x +µ △ u, ρ ∂v ∂t +ρ∂v ∂x u +ρ∂v ∂y v +ρ∂u ∂z w = y - ∂p ∂y +µ △ v, (1) ρw ∂t +ρ∂w ∂x u +ρ∂w ∂y v +∂w ∂z w = z - ∂p ∂z +µ △ w, with fixed regional conditions and is distinguished by the fact that in the considered class of functions for any ε> 0 and t ≥ t0 Δ = δ (ε, t0), t0 = 0 that is in∥∥∥v0 —cos3µ - 12 x + y + z∥∥∥ <Δ should be ∥∥∥v (t, x, y, z) — Exp - off −1t cos3µ - 12 x + y + z∥∥∥ <ε, where V0 is the initial condition of the initial system of equations (1.1) of the unestroyed course, taking into account 1 = D3 −1P/D X X + D3 −1P/D Y + D3 —1P /d z z. Then the solution of the initial system of equations (1) decreases and strives for 0 asymptotically. Literature 1. Kotov P.A.
