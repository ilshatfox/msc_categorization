The application of Hilbert's task with the logarithmic degeneration of the index at infinity to the construction of conformal display E.N. Khasanova1, P.L. Shabalin2 1 Enkarabasheva@bk.ru; Kazan State Architectural and Construction University 2 Pavel.shabalin@mail.ru; The Kazan State Architectural and Civil Engineering University in the work carried out the construction of a structural formula of a special class of half-plate display to polygonal regions with a counting number of peaks and unlimited rotation of the tangent. The class of display is highlighted by restriction on the density of the distribution of the sequence of the angles of the tangent to the boundary of the image of the half -plate during the transition through the top of the landfill. For this class, the criterion for the existence of single -leaf -out display represented by this structural formula has been proven. Keywords: conformal display, one -leaf, the regional task of Hilbert. In the plane of the complex alternating ζ = ₽+I, we denote D = {ζ, IMζ> 0}, l = ∂d, l+, l - positive and negative semi -axles. We consider the generalization of one reverse task M.A. Lavrentieva about the construction of a conformal display of half -plane D to a polygon with specified angles in case of unknown peaks in case of display to a polygonal region with a counting multitude of corners and endless rotation of the tangent when going around the boundary of the region. The prototypes are set {t --k} ⊂ l -, {tk} ⊂ l+, k = 1, φ, unknown peaks a -k, ak, polygon l consisting of two broken l+, l - with the general ends of A0 and A least, limiting The DZ area is a complex plane Z = x + I Y, located, possibly on the riman surface. The points t -k, tk satisfy the conditions φ∑ k = 1 1 tk <mm, φ∑ k = 1 1 | t -k | <Imes. (1) We also consider the internal corners of α --kπ -αkp, the vertices a -k è AK, respectively, is 0 <αk <1, 1 <α -k <2, k = 1, urb. The latter, however, can vary, remaining in the class of display, determined by the following restrictions on the parameters of the DZ region. In addition to the condition (1) we will consider the inequalities | n ∗+(₽) –∆ lnαү | <C, | n ∗ - (perf) −∆ lnαă | <C (2) with positive constant ∆, α, c. Here n ∗ - (hole) =   0, 0 <ctor <–T -1, k∑ j = 1 κ - j, –T - –K <hole <–T -K -1, n ∗+(₽) =   0, 0 <lection <t1, k∑ j = 1 κ j, tk <oring <tk+1, κK = 1–αk, κ --k = α --k −1, k = 1, ∞. 394 Materials of the International School-Conference. The structural formula of conformal display with the restrictions described above was obtained using the solution of Hilbert's homogeneous problem with explosive coefficients and bilateral swirling at the infinity of the type O (lnα | ctor), where 0 <α. This method of building a conformal display is presented in the work of R.B. Salimova and P.L. Shabalina [1], in which the task of constructing the half -plane to the polygon with an infinite number of vertices is solved using the homogeneous task of Hilbert with the counting many points of rupture of the coefficients of the regional condition and bilateral twilight at the infinity of the steppe order O (| x | α), 0 <α <α <α <α <α < 1. The following is true (see [2], [3]) theorem. Theorem. In order to in the classroom of display (1), (2) there are single -leafy necessary and enough to make the inequality 0 <α≤ 1. Literature 1.

Chistyakov1 1 vchistyakov@hse.ru; National Research University “Higher School of Economics” - Nizhny Novgorod represent elements of the theory of modular spaces on arbitrary sets, which simultaneously develops the theory of such spaces on linear sets and the theory of metric spaces. The relationship between (three) modular spaces and metrics on them is studied in a convex and non -fooled cases.
