"Lobachev readings - 2019" UDC 517.928 Analysis of threshold phenomena in the model of the electrochemical reactor N.M. Firstova1 1 FIRSTOVA.NATALIA@yandex.ru; Samara National Research University named after Academician S.P. The queen in the work raises the question of comparing the values ​​of the control parameter for the trajectory, obtained for the dynamic system, and the values ​​in which the solution of the stochastic system under consideration becomes unstable, that is, more amplitude vibrations are observed in the system. The dynamics of changing the values ​​of the control parameter of the stochastic system was built when the noise intensity changes. Keywords: trajectories, stability, system stability, random disturbances in the work considered a modified two-dimensional model of the electrochemical reaction of the Coopera-Iliter [1, 2] from the point of view of taking into account the influence of the fluctuations of the environment on the course of the chemical reaction. Since these fluctuations are random in nature, their accounting in the framework of the alleged modification should lead to the fact that the new model will be considered stochastic. Naturally, such indignation should be introduced through an additive additive into the parameters of the inpatient process. Suppose that the system contains white noise of low intensity: {du d t = −kaeγθ/2u (1–θ)+kd e --γθ/2θ+1 --u+ϵ. ă1 = p (u, θ), βdθd t = kaeγθ/2u (1–θ) −kd e -γθ/2θ --keeα0 f eθ+ϵ. cil2 = q (u, θ). (1) A variable U is a dimensionless concentration of a substance on the surface (surface concentration), β is a dimensionless volumetric concentration of a substance. Domestic variable θ reflects the amount of substance adsorbed on the surface of the electrode, E is the potential of the electrode, β is the adsorbate coefficient, α0 is the symmetry coefficient for the transfer of electrons. The current density is set in a dimensionless form by means of the equation j = keeα0 F Eθ; F = f /(RT), where R is a universal gas constant, f is a constant faradea, t is the temperature, hole and ₽ - scalar standard independent vinerian processes; ϵ - the intensity of random interference. Since the β parameter is small, the system is a singularly indignant. In the works [3, 4, 5], a detailed analysis of the deterministic model was carried out using methods of the theory of singular disturbances and numerical methods. It was shown that the critical regime is modeled by the trajectory of the grid and that it is this regime that plays the role of a peculiar watership between the two main types of reaction flow modes: a stable cycle and vibrations with self-risk. The trajectory is the ear and the value of the control parameter K ∗ E was N.M. Firstova 199 are presented in the form of asymptotic decomposition according to the degrees of the small parameter β: u0 (θ) = (kd e γγθ/2 +χ0eα0 f e) θ kaeγθ/2 (1–θ), (2) u1 (θ) = –kau0 (θ) (1–θ) eγθ/2+kd e --γθ/2θ+1 --u0 (θ)+χ1eα0 f eθu′0 (θ) kaeγθ/2u ′ 0 (θ), χ0 = ka (1– θ̄ ) Eγθ̄/2 –kd e --γθ̄/2θ̄ (ka (1– θ̄) eγθ̄/2 −1) eα0 f e θ̄, (3) χ1 = - kau1 (θ̄) (1– θ̄) eγθ̄/2 +u1 ( θ̄)+kAU1 (θ̄) u′1 (θ̄) (1– θ̄) eγθ̄/2 eα0ζe θ̄u′1 (θ̄). Here θ = θ̄ is the value at the disruption point obtained from the equation of irregular points: kAU (1-θ) γ 2 eγθ/2 –Kaueγθ/2 —CD e -γθ/2 +kd e -γ γ 2 −keeα0 f E = 0. (4) Equations (2) and (4) determine the points of the interpretation. For the studied stochastic system, we find a special point, as well as the meaning of the control parameter K ∗ ∗ E, in which a change in its type occurs. To do this, we write down the following system of equations: {−Kaeγθ/2u (1–θ)+KD e -γθ/2θ+1 --u+ϵ. ă1 = 0, kae γθ/2u (1–θ) −kd e -γθ/2 step --keeαo f eθ+ϵ. ξ2 = 0. From which we obtain equations for finding u ∗ venting: u ∗ = 1–Keαo f eθ ∗ + ϵ (. ă1 +. ă2), (5) and equation, determining value θ = θ ∗ police: kae γθ/2 (1–Keαo F Eθ) (1-θ) −KD E --γθ/2 step --keeαo f eθ+. cil2 = 0. (6) The equation is transcendental and does not have a general solution, the specific value of the θ ∗ venting parameter can be found in numerically for various sets of system parameters. Thus, we obtain a special point A (θ ∗, 1–Keαo F Eθ LS). For the linarization of the system (1), we find our own values ​​at this point. To do this, we will solve the following equation: | j λ; = 0: ∣∣∣∣∣ ∂ f (u, θ) ∂u − − ∂ f (u, θ) ∂θ ∂g (u, θ) ∂u ∂g (u, θ) ∂θ λ λ ∣∣ ∣∣∣ a = 0, 200 “Lobachev readings - 2019” What can be written in the form of λ2 +λw1 +w2 = 0, with discriminant d = w 21 −4w2, (7) where W1 = kaeγθ ∗ police/2 (1- θ ∗)+kaeγθ ∗ police/2u ∗ venting (1– γ 2 (1–θ ∗ police))+kd e -γθ ∗/2 (1– γθ yware 2)+Keeα0 F E +1, ( 8) w2 = kaeγθ ∗ police/2 (1–θ ∗ ∗) Keeα0 f e +kaeγθ ∗/2u ∗ police (1– θ ∗ venting)) +KD e --γθ ∗/2 (1- γθ ∗ ∗ 2)+keeα0 f e. Based on the analysis of the type of special points carried out in the work [3, 4, 5], we can conclude that the type of special point depends only on the sign W1, that is, the loss of stability occurs at W1 = 0. We equalize the expression (8) to 0 and We find the value of the controller parameter K ∗ ∗ E, in which the system loses stability. k ∗ E = kae γθ ∗/2 (1–θ ∗+ (1– γ2 (1–θ ∗)) (1+ ϵ (. ξ1+. mit))+ kd e --γθ fur /2 (1- γθ ∗ ∗ 2) +1 (kaeγθ ∗/2 step (1– γ2 (1–θ ∗)) - 1) eα0 f e (8) to study the effect of external noise on the behavior of the system The following values ​​are recorded
