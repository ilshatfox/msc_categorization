The procedure for almost the bulge of regular functions, let the function f (z) = z + ger∑ n = 2 anz n is regular in the circle E = {z: | z | <1}. The function F (Z) is called almost convex in E if there is such convex in E function G (Z) that Re [F ′ (Z)/G ′ (Z)]> 0 For all z ∈ E [1]. Let K - a class of almost convex in E functions f (z). It is known [1] that f (z) ∈ K is then and only when ∫ θ2 θ1 ∂ ∂ ∂ arg (zf ′ (z)) dθ> –γ (r) π> −π, z = rei step for any θ1 , θ2 such that 0 <θ2 - θ1 <2π. The value of γ (r) is called the order of almost the bulge of the function f (z) in the circle | z | <r [2]. In connection with the determination of the procedure for almost the bulge of the function g (z) = ∫ z 0 [f ′ (ζ)] α+I β dζ, where f (z) ∈ K, new approaches to the results from [3] (see also [see. 4]).

Khabipov (Kazan) The construction of a model wing profile with a purely circulation flow proposed a simple method for constructing a model profile, which is implemented purely circulating flowing of an ideal inconspicuous liquid. As a comprehensive potential of the flow of such a profile, the complex potential is used from a vortex -resistant placed in a plane -parallel stream, W (z) = Q - Imb 2π ln z + vift, where Q is the abundance of the source, γ - the circulation of the vortex and vimate - the speed of the incurred stream. At the same time, part of one of the current lines of such a course is taken over the profile circuit. As a result, the contour of the profile, which has the shape of a “snail”, through the hole in which the flow is carried out. On the basis of numerical calculations, various forms of such profiles were found depending on the ratio of the vortex circulation and the abundance of the source. An analysis of the nature of the course was also carried out depending on the location of the gap on the profile circuit. The optimal value of the initial parameters was found, in which the flow of the largest part of the circuit occurs without separation of the border layer. The work was supported by the RFFF (projects 99-01–00365, 99-01-04029), the program “Universities of Russia” and the ROCR Foundation of the Academy of Sciences. V.F. Pulyaev, E. Yu.
