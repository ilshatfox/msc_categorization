Summs of the values ​​of the functions from the classes Har di theorem 1. Let a certain set of points (1, ..., (n (n ~ 3), and in the class of CE Hardy {!} = N 1 (C+ (C+ ) I. I.M.M. Sup {i l: = l f ((k) 1: llflln, ~ 1} = m (1) then m · mink {~ (k} ~ a1 ln (lnp)/lnn, and 1 = COPST. 0'Censing is accurate in order, if in condition (1) S.M.Y. 2: F ((K), replace with I: F '((K) (when other conditions are preserved}, then instead of The previous assessment of the DED DEM I. Mead vfvi mink {~ (k} ~ a2 ln2 p/ jTI, A2 = COPST. We formulate such a statement for the functions of the Hardy class {!} = H 1 (D+) in the appearance n+ = {z: z:; ZL> 1} of a single circle with an additional condition f (OO) = F. Theorem 2. Let {(1, ..., (p} with n+, and in the indicated class we have sup {i l:; = l f (k (k ) :: llflln1 ~ 1} = M. Then mink {i (k i -1} ~ az ln p/n (az = Copst) with sufficiently large n ~ p0 (m). The assessment is accurate in order, let it be in d = {z: 1 z j <1} set an endless follow -up a = {(j} points, pairing hyperbolic the spread (relative to D) between which is no less than A4, and the number of points from A lying in circles {z: lz 1 <r} with o <r <1, ​​not less than a5 / (1 - r) (a4, A5 = const). Theorem 3. Let p> o, f e hp (d), 1/; (x)> o- the function that is non-x> about the function is such that lima:-+oo x- 1/; (x) = = x) = OS. Then, for the specified sequence, A = {(j} has. And 2 :: ~ 1 EW (K) 1 F ((K) 1 = OO. Note (see, for example, the work of V.Ya. Eiderman in mathema, notes, notes. 1995, vol. 57, N 1, p. 150-153) that such estimates of the amounts are used in the study of O (P)-, O (P)-Fullness of the SIS of the fractions {1/(z-(k)} in spaces Hardy, Nevanlinna and others.
