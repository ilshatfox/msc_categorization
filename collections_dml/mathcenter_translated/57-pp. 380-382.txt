Lobachevsky 2 Elena.shirokova@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N.I. Lobachevsky in this article evaluate the error of the method of linear-free Internet method to solve the three-dimensional problem of a conductor for the Laplace equation in a three-dimensional body with a smooth surface. We reduce the solution of a three -dimensional problem to a set of solutions of two -dimensional problems in separate layers; And the accuracy of the method has order (∆H). Keywords: a three-dimensional task of the airship, the altogether, the error assessment. Let the paragraph - a limited three -dimensional single -link area, ∂ω - boundary smooth surface ω. Then the corresponding task of the conductor for the Laplass equation is to find the function of the function u (x, y, h), which is differently differentiated in ω∪∂ω and satisfying the three -dimensional equation of Laplace ∂2u (x, y, h) ∂x2 + ∂ 2u (x, y, h) ∂y2 + ∂ 2u (x, y, h) ∂h2 = 0, (x, y, h) ∈, (1) and boundary conditions: u (x, y, h, h ) = f (x, y, h), (x, y, h) ∈ ∂ω, a ≤ h ≤ b. (2) The method of its approximate solution we propose is based on the splashing -terminal solution of the three -dimensional problem of the conductor for the Laplace equation. We divide the body into n layers with planes h = hi, i = 1.2, · · · ·, n, and h1 = a, hn = b. The splasen in each layer is a polynomial from H with the coefficients that are polygarmonic functions in the sections of the pularities of H = Hi. The space solution in any layer is set in the following form [1]: u (x, y, h) = p∑ k = 0 uk (x, y) h k. Having taken p = 1, we get the linear spay u (x, y, h) = u0 (x, y)+hu1 (x, y). If we substitute this form of solution in (1) - (2), we get the following ratio: ∆2UK (x, y) = 0, k = 0.1, where ∆2 = ∂2x +∂2y, with boundary conditions that coincide, matching C (2) at the levels h = h J. The coefficients UK (X, Y), K = 0.1 are harmonic functions from X and Y, which can be restored through their boundary values ​​using the COSHE integral method [2]. The functions of ui k (x, y), k = 0.1 are determined by the use of analytical continuation in the combination of projections of intersections ω with h = hi A. Elshenavi, E.A. Shirokova 381 Fig. 1. The cross section of the body with a fixed θ and h = hi+1. Compare the planning-internal solution with the exact solution of the relevant problem. Since for harmonic functions the maximum of the module of the difference is achieved on the border, the proximity of the altogether-internal solution to accurate is ensured by the proximity of the boundary values ​​of the altogether-interpolation values ​​to the specified boundary values. Consider without loss of community the simplest case when any cross -section of the body with a plane h = const is a star -shaped area relative to zero. Lemma 1: Let r = φ (θ, h), θ ∈ [0.2π], h ∈ [a, b] - a smooth boundary surface set in terms of cylindrical coordinates R, θ, h. Let F (θ, h) - the boundary value of the function, harmonic in the body, limited to a given surface. Suppose that f (θ, h) - Polin Fourier at any h ∈ [a, b] and that there are constant a, b> 0, such that ∣∣φ ′ h (θ, h) ∣∣ ≤ a and | F ′ H (θ, h) | ≤ b. Then the maximum error of the linear recording solution of the three-dimensional problem of the conductor for the equation of Laplace equal (∆H), where ∆H is the size of the interpolation step. Proof: We denote the close analytical spinning -terminal solution through U (r, θ, h). For fixed θ = θ0, the planning in the layer h ∈ [hi, hi+1] are defined as u (r̃, h̃) = ui0 (r̃, hi)+(h̃ –hi) ui1 (r̃, hi+1), where r̃ = max (φ (θ0, hi), φ (θ0, hi+1)). Suppose that r̃ = φ (θ0, hi+1) and the value of u0 (r̃, hi) was obtained by an analytical continuation due to the condition for φ (θ, h) under fairly small values ​​∆h. Note that ui0 (r̃, hi)+(hi+1 —hi) ui1 (r̃, hi+1) = ui+10 (r̃, hi+1) = f (θ0, hi+1), now the absolute value of the error With h = h̃, θ = θ0, it has the following rating: ∣∣∣u (r̃, h̃) - f (θ0, h̃) ∣∣∣ = ∣∣∣ui0 (r̃, hi)+ (h̃ –hi) ui1 (r̃ , hi+1) - f (θ0, h̃) ∣∣∣ = ∣∣∣ui0 (r̃, hi)+(hi+1 —hi) ui1 (r̃, hi+1)+(h̃ –hi+1) ui1 (r̃, hi+1) - f (θ0, h̃) ∣∣∣, ≤ | ui+10 (r̃, hi+1) - f (θ0, hi+1) |+| (h̃ –hi) ui1 ( r̃, hi+ 1) |+ | F (θ0, hi+1) - f (θ0, h̃) |. 382 Materials of the School-Conference, therefore, | U (φ (θ, h), h)-f (θ, h) | ≤ently max 1≤i≤n - 1 0≤θ≤2π | ui1 (r, hi+1) |+b∆h = o (∆h).
