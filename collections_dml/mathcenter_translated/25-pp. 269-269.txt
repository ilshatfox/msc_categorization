) The method of modeling borders with features in the tasks of the theory of underwater diagrams is given the development and generalization of the method of modeling the boundaries of the section of the type of dipole and the solution of the problems of moving the wing profile of the arbitrary shape in the flow of my fluid with the boundaries of the section of various types: horizon with a total wall, free surface, surface Drag the liquids of different density and flow rate. The impact on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the underwater circular cylinder along with the strength of the gravity of the surface tension on the free border is considered. Forms of surface gravitational capillary waves are determined. The established pulsating and oscillators of circular and elliptical cylinders, as well as plates in the canal with a free surface and two -layer liquid, have been investigated. The calculations of average for the period of forces and the coeff of the fitsins of the joined masses were carried out. Non -linear effects on the free surface with the progressive movement of the underwater wing profile have been studied. The forms of nonlinear surface waves in the flow of real hydro -profile. Comparisons with the experimental and calculated data of other authors were compared.
