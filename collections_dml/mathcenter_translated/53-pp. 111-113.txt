The existence of solutions to the elliptical problem in the anisotropic spaces of Sobolev-Oorlich in the arbitrary unlimited area ⊂ rn, n> 2, for anisotropic elliptical equations of the second order, the task of the airship n∑ α = 1 (Aα (x, u, ∇u) xα-a0 (x, u, ∇u) = 0, u ∣∣∣ ∂ω = 0. (1) it is assumed that the functions of Aα (X, S0, S), α = 0 ,. . . , n, x ∈ ∈ ω, S = (S0, S) = (S0, S1,., SN) ∈ Rn+1 karateodorias are subordinate to the following conditions. 1) There are measurable non -negative functions ψ (x), ψ (x), ∗ (x), φ (x) such that for P.V. x ∈ ω and any S0 ∈ R, S, T ERN, S 6 = T, fair of inequality: n∑ α = 0 Aα (X, S0, S) SACH (X) N∑ α = 0 Bα (SA. ) - ψ (x); n∑ α = 0 bα (aα (x, s0, s)) 6 φ (x) n∑ α = 0 bα (sα) + ψ (x); 112 A.A. Nikitin n∑ α = 1 (Aα (X, S0, S) - Aα (X, S0, T)) (SAK - TAL) 0. 2) functions B0 (Z), B1 (Z) , ..., BN (Z) and additional B0 (Z), B1 (Z), ..., BN (Z) satisfy ∆2 -result (see [1]), and there is also ǫ, such that 0 <ǫ <1 and bα (z 1+ǫ) ≺ b0 (z), α = 1, 2 ,. . . , n. 3) for non -negative functions lus, ψ, ψ, φ occur the inclusion ψ, ψ ∈ L1, LOC (ω), 1/ip, lus, φ ∈ Linger, LOC (ω). The resolution of the problem (1) is investigated in the local about the wanderings of Sobolev-Oorlich, no conditions for the growth of input data at x → urb are not applied. Theorem. If conditions 1) - 3 are fulfilled, then there is a generalized solution to the problem (1). Earlier L.M. Kozhevnikova and A.A. Haji (Nikitina) in [2] the existence of a solution to the problem (1), subject to the strict monotony of the corresponding elliptic operator. In this work, this result was obtained only if a strict aggregate monotony of the functions Aα (X, S0, S), α = 1 ,. . . , n, according to the variable s ∈ Rn. It has been proved that the corresponding elliptical operator is pseudo -thinn. The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFI (about the ECT 16-31-50034/16).

Through l1 (a), licles (a), the spaces introduced in the work [1] are marked. The subset of the I set MPR is called orthoidal in MPR if the following conditions are met: (i) q 6 p ∈ I, Q ∈ MPR = ⇒ Q ∈ I, (II) p, Q ∈ I, PQ = 0 = ⇒ P+ Q ∈ I . Let I - Ortoidal in MPR.
