The existence of solutions to the non -linear problem of the equilibrium of the non -existence of the shells in the movements of R.SCMA. Rigs Kra.ev. I am a task. Geometrically and physical theory of thin elastic anisotropic non -nominal shells of non -equal Gaussian curvature with Sha.rnirically covered with my edges. The aim of the work is to proof of the theorem of a generalized solution in the space of movements. The central place in the proposed studies occupies the construction of the space of movements H (P). For this purpose, the task of Riemann - Hilbert for generalized an anus is used. Finding a generalized solution, entered with the help of the variational principle of Lagrange, reduces the solution of the non -linear operator equation of the type C) - G (c)) = O, (1) where G (CJ) is an non -linear limited operator in h (q). The perceptibility of equation (1) is established by the variation method. For this purpose, the functionality J (C)) of the complete energy of the system "shell. - load." Is introduced into consideration. Showers are that with some restrictions on physico -geometry characteristics of the shell functionality J (W): 1) is defined and differentiated at any point n (p), and grad j (c. 1) = c) - G (c)) ; 2) weakly half -snow from below in n (n); 3) is increasing functionality in n (p). Then, on the basis of a generalized Weerstrass theorem, the functionality of J (C)) on. N (P) has an absolute minimum point, which is the desired solution to the problem equal to weight. 260
