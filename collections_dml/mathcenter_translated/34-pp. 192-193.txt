One class of ramanan structures of almost a work of O. V. Sukhov Penza State Pedagogical University Let M-a smooth N-diversity diversity. On the mi task for the structure of almost works, if two additional differentiated distributions are set - horizontal H: x → HX and vertical v: x → vx, txm = hx ⊕ vx. We denote the symbols H and V design operators on H and V, respectively. Obviously, the following properties take place: h2 = h, v2 = v, hv = vh = 0. Then p = v - h is the operator of the structure of almost the work: p 2 = id. Let 〈·, ·〉 There is Rimanova Metric on m. The riman structure of almost a work on M is the structure of almost a work on M such that for any vector fields x, y 〈x, y〉 = 〈hx, hy〉 + 〈vx, vy〉. In the work of [1], Naveir identified the 64th grade of the Riman structures of almost a work and received their invariant character. Let us consider as an initial variety the tangler stratification TM, endowed with infinitezimal coherently. Then on the TM we have a natural structure almost about accounting: tz (tm) = hz ⊕ vz, where z = (x, y) ∈ TM, hz is a horizontal distribution, VZ is a vertical distribution relating to layers. From the determination it follows that Rimanova Metric G on TM is a metrium of the structure of almost a work and only when G (XV, Y H) = G (XH, Y V) = 0, 194 Where XH and XV is horizontal and vertical Lifts of the eyelids of the Thorny fields X, Y from the base for tangent stratification. For the Riman structure of almost a work (TM, G, P), the invariant characteristics of all classes are obtained. For some classes, examples of data is built. In particular, the theorem has been proven. If g (xh, y h) = 〈x, y〉, g (xv, y v) = g (x, y) = onic 〈x, y〉 + ψ 〈x, y〉 y, y〉, where 〈·, · ·〉〉 - Rimanova Metric on M, G - generalized Lagranzhev Metric Tamma [2], and infiniteic connectivity is generated by the truncated coherence of the cardan of the metric there, then the structure (TM, G, P) belongs to the class (TGF, AF) [1 ], the vertical distribution of which is determined by a completely geodetic formation, and horizontal - anti -layering.
