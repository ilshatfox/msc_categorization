-Differenticability of display on carno groups in various topologies and some application the purpose of the report is to discuss the concept of P-radiation 58 [1] of the Carno groups (a special class of nilpotent groups of Lee), which should be considered as a natural generalization of the differentiation of the eliminations of Euclidean spaces. This concept naturally arose in [1] in case of proof of the theorem of the type of Rademacher for the Lipshitsevs in the Carno -Karateodori Metrics of the Carno groups. Further results on the P-radiation of the carnos groups are established in [2], [3], where the theorem on approximative differentias (display of carno groups, approximatically P-differentiated along the horizontal vector fields has a complete approximative P-radio-radiolence), the theorem, the theorem, the theorem Type Stepanov, Theorems on P-Roathelism of Display Classes of Sobolev in Sobolev’s topology and other results. As applications, the results are given on the geometric theory of measures in the groups of the carno (formula of area and koploshchad) and the results on the geometric theory of functions in carno groups (analytical definition of quasiconic display [4], etc.). The work was supported by the RFFIF and the program "Universities of Russia". L and T R A 1. Pansu P. métriques de Carnot - Carathéodory et quasiisométries desespace symétriques de Rang un // Ann.
