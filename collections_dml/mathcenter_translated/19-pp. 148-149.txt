The existence of positive solutions of the Equation DI = IF (LIL) on spherically symmetrical varieties is devoted to the study of the properties of solutions by: Tuline Elliptical Equation of the following type: DI = IF (LIL), (1) where f (o? O - monotonously increasing, continuously differential is civilized Function for ~ (<oo, on the riman varieties of some special species. Let lf- complete rimanovo diversity, represented in the form of m ::: [: o, +oo) x 5p-1. In polar coordinates (r, 6 ) (where 1 · e (o, + oo), 6 e 5p -l) Rimanova Metric on m \ {} is defined as DS2 :::: Dr2 + G2 (R) D62, where G (1 ·) - Positive, smooth on (o, +oo) function, g (o) = o, g '(o) = 1, and d6 2 is the standard metric in the sphere of SP -1. We will say that in the diversity, resolve11.1A task is task Dirich, Designations: 00 [:::: / GL -n (t) dt, then 148 11 = j g1-n (t) (j gp- 1 (s) ds) dt, 12 = j g1-n (t) (j gn-3 (s) ds) dt , then roo is somewhere = const> o, n = dsh l,/. Theorem 1. 1). If the Rimanovo variety of 1'.1 is this, read 1 = OS or 11 = OO, then IA JL.1 exists of telly limited solutions of equation (1). 2). If the Rimanovo variety of M is such, 'that 11 <00 1 then on L1 there are positive limited solutions of equi (1). If, in addition, 12 <00 1, for any continuous positive on 5p-1 functions f (o) on LF, permit Eada'ch a conductor for the equation (1). Similar tasks for the linear elliptical equalities of the Yu1y on the Rimannovs are diverse. Wizards were previously studied in the works [1], [2]. Theorem 2. ES.L: And the variety of M is such that g '(r)> o and -1/2 j (j tf (t) dt) ds = oo, then there are endlessly a lot of positive whole Solutions of the equation (1).
