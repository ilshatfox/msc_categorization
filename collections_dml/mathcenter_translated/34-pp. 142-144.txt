. The conditions for the symmetry of the fundamental object of the 3rd order of the submissiveness of A.V. Kuleshov Russian State University named after I. Kant, Kaliningrad, olga_omelyan2002@mail.ru examined the smooth diversity of VN and its submarine VM. Differential equalities of 144 submarous collection VM are continued twice. In the obtained equations, the components of the λaijk fundamental object of the 3rd Order for multiparty arise. 4 sufficient conditions of symmetry of these components were found. Consider the smooth diversity of VN with the structural equations of Laptev dωi = ωj ∧ ωij (i, j, k = 1,., N), continuing which we get dωij = ω k j ∧ ωik + ωk ∧ ωijk. We will write the equations of the submachment VM in the form ωa = λ a i ω i (i, j, k = 1,., M; a, b, C = m+ 1,., N). Consistently continuing these equations, we get the RENCIAL equations for the component of the fundamental volume of the 1st and 2nd order. The latter have the form of 4λIij - λbijλakωkb - 2λak (iλ b j) ω k b + ω a ij = λ a ijkω k, where 4λaij = dλiij - λakjahωki + λbijωab, ωiij = λkij + λbjipib) Λkλbi (ωkbj + λcjωkbc) + λbi (ωabj + λcjωabc), λaijk-components of the fundamental object of the 3rd Order, and λa I [jk] = 0. sentence. For the symmetry λaijk, for all lower indices, one of the following conditions is enough: 145 ωi [jk] = 0, ω I [jk] ω ω k = 0, ωijk ∧ ωk = 0, ωijk ∧ ωj = 0. lobe. A T U R A 1. Laptev G.F.

Kuaterin Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, Xredor@yandex.ru in [1] proposed a regulatory version of the algo of the rhythm of Udzava to solve the problem of optimal management. This work continues research in this direction for an abstract parabolic equation. Let h - the Hilbert space, u1, u2 ⊂ h - convex closed sets, d ≡ ≡ {u ∈ L2 (0, t; h): u (t) ∈ U1 for p. t ∈ [0, T]} × {V ∈ H: V ∈ U2} - a lot of permissible controls. The reverse task is considered to find the minimum in terms of the norm of the element π = (u, v) ∈ D according to the observation of Y (t) ∈ H for 146, approximately known at the final moment of time,
