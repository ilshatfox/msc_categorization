) The extreme lengths of the families of curves on compact riman surfaces for calculating and evaluating the extreme lengths of families of closed homotopic curves on marked compact riman surfaces are proposed to consider the corresponding tasks on universal covering these surfaces, as well as in their fundamental polygons. 1. Let Tω - marked Thor with the generators 1 and ω, IM ω> 0, α = arg ω; Γm, n is the homotopic class of closed curves on tω, performing m turns along and n - across the torah handle, λm, n - the extreme length of the family γm, n. Theorem 1 [1]. The values ​​of the extreme lengths λ1.0 and λ0.1 of families γ1.0 and γ0.1 on the Torah Taver are λ1.0 = 1 | ω | sin α λ0.1 = | ω | sin α, respectively. Extremal length λm, n families γm, n, m2 + n2> 0, associated with λ1.0 and λ0.1 by the ratio λm, n = m 2λ1.0 + n 2λ0.1 + 2mnctg α, λm, n = | m + nω | 2 | ω | sin α. 82 Due to the conformal invaria of extreme length of the steam of extreme lengths of the families of curves on the Torah, it determines this Thor with an accuracy of a conformal or anti -conform display, that is, the role of the Torah modules can play. 2. Let RG = RG (A1, B1, A2, B2,., AG, BG) - the surface of the Rimanov’s compact surface of the genus G ≥ 2 with the selected canonical sections A1 ,. . . , AG, B1. . . , BG, following the handles of the surface R and under the handles, respectively. The surface of the R0G is called symmetrical if its fundamental polygon is the correct non-Euclides of the 4G-angle. Theorem 2 [2]. Let γM be a family of closed homotopic curves on R0G, performing m turns along a certain arbitrary handle of this surface. Then λ (γm) = 2m 2 k (k) k ′ (k), k = (1 - cosπ/4g) (1 + cos 3π/4g) sin π/4g sin 3π/4g, where k (k) and K ′ (K) - Elliptical Integles Lyandra. L and T R A 1. Count S. Yu.
