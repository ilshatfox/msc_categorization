One syngular integro -referential equation is a number of applied tasks (see, e.g., [1]) leads to the need to solve the problem of the Cosha ≡ ′ ′ (t) + a (t) ∈ (t) + λb (t) πρ (t)) +1∫ −1 ρ (τ) onic (τ) τ - t dτ = f (t), (1) −1 <t <1, Сory (−1) = 0, (2) where a (t), b (t), f (t) - known continuous functions, λ - numerical parameter, ρ (t) = (1- t) α (1 + t) β (−1 <α, β <1) - weight function, weight function, weight A ∗ (t) - the desired function. Let l2 (ρ; [−1; 1]) = l2 (ρ) - a weighty swagger space with the usual norm, and W 12 (ρ; [−1, 1]) ≡ w 12 (ρ) - the weight of the sable space of functions on [−1; 1], satisfying the condition (2), in which the norm is determined by the formula ‖ices ‖ices 12 (ρ) = ‖ware ′ ‖l2 (ρ) (onic ∈ W 12 (ρ)). Sufficient conditions for the limitations of the operator A: W 12 (ρ) → L2 (ρ) and its limited reversibility are established both with 200 small λ ∈ C and with arbitrary λ ∈ R. For this purpose, sufficient conditions are established (also of independent interest) as an independent interest continuity, and the complete continuity of the operator t: w 12 (ρ) → z, t (onic; t) = 1 πρ (t) +1∫ −1 ρ (τ) onic (τ) τ - t dτ, - 1 < t <1, where z is any of the spaces L2 (ρ), C [−1, 1], CQ [−1, 1], and Q = Q (T) - an auxiliary weight function, unambiguously determined by the initial data.

However, all full systems found in these works (1) are not minimal. The first example of a complete and at the same time minimum system (1) in L2 was indicated by R. Zalik and A. T. Saad in 1987 for the case α = 2. T. A. Salnikova (1995) already presented a whole class of complete and minimum systems (1 ) in L2, but again at α = 2. Author (1998), wide classes of full and minimum systems (1) in lp = lp (r), p ≥ 2 were built, already for all α> 1.20
