The analogue of LiUville theorem for the solutions of the Helmholtz equation in the work received an ANA .. '1og LiUville theorem for decisions of the Helmholtz equation. Namely, it was shown that if the solution is F (x1, ..., xk) of this equation lf + lf = o,> .. <o, it has a degree in the semi -space and equal to zero on the border of this semi -space, then it is identical to zero. For harmonic functions, such a statement is not. An example is the XK function. The difference between decisions of Laplaceâ€™s equi. From the solutions of the Helmholtz equation, it is that the Helmholtz operator is elliptical in wing, unlike Laplace operator. The work was carried out under the financial sub -clan of the Presidential Program of the Russian Federation "Leading Scientific Schools of the Russian Federation" (the NS project 7347.2010.1).
