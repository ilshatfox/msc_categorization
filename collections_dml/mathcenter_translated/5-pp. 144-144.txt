The complete symbolic integral equation in the class of unequal functions is considered the full singular integral equal equal [lj k1.p = k0 1.p+lk1.p = f, hej \ t, (1) where j = [a; , In] - a segment of the actual straight line, t = {xo, x 1 "", xn+1}, xo = a, xn+l = /3 - breakdown of the segment J. K0 = a]+bs --- a characteristic Singular integral operator with Gelderov coefficients A (x), b (x), with A2 (x) - b2 (x) = 1 on j, 1 - an identical operator, s operator of the singular integration along J, k is a regular operator with Gelderovsky According to both variable core, l is the numerical parameter and ILI - a fairly small value. Equation (1) is solved in the class of functions represented in the form (2) where 1,/! (X) - a function from the class of N. I.: vlushelishvili [1] with junctions n o:, c; W (: r) = n (x - xj). The right part f (x) equations (1) is taken from class (2). The solution of equation (1) is built according to the classical scheme, taking into account the presentation (2). First, the equation K0 1.p = F is solved in class (2) [2), then regulatory is carried out by the Carlem Na-Voya method. The pre -trialized equation is solved by the method after the pre -approximate approaches. Literature 1. Muskhelishvili N. I. Singular integral equalities. - M.: Science, 1968 .-- 512 p. 2.
