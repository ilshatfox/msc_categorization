) The analogue of Privalov’s theorem for the multiple rows of Walsh in 1923 I. I. Privalov [1] proved the following theorem: if the trigonometric series is everywhere, except, perhaps, some closed U -Mnity, converges to the final summarized function F, then this series There is a number of Fourier functions f. The analogue of Privalov’s theorem for the Walsha system was received by V. A. Skvortsov [2]. We turn to the multiple rows of Walsha. The set of a ⊂ [0, 1) n will be called the VALSHA essential for the N-fold rows, if it contains n surfaces of the type XI = FI (x1, ..., 230 XI-1I, XI+1, ..., XN), (XN), ( I = 1, 2, ..., n), where FI is arbitrary functions. Through KN, we denote the class N-frequent rows of Walsha, each of which converges along the rectangles on some significant set (each on its own). Theorem 1. Let F and G-Summarized functions on [0, 1) n, the rows of the fury-uolsha of which s (f) and s (G) belong to the KN class. If F and G coincide on some open set G, then S (F) and S (G) is equal to G (i.e., the difference of the rows converges along the rectangles to zero on G). Theorem 2. Let the series S class connes through rectangles everywhere, with the exception, perhaps, closed by the U -Mnity to the ultimate summered function F, and a number of Fourier S (F) functions F are also KN class. Then S = S (F). The work was supported by the Russian Federation (project 99-01-00355). L and T R A T R A 1. Privalov I.I. Generalization of the theorem Paul du Bois Rey Mond’s // Matem.
