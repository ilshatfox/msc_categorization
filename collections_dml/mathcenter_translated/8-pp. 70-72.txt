) The classification of polynomas with the smallest integral norm according to their four senior coefficients, let the material RN + 4 (x) = xn + 4 + a1xn ​​+ 3 + a2x n + 2 + a3xn + 1 + a4xn +. . . + an+ 4 has the smallest norm in 70 space L [−1, 1] due to the choice of A4 ,. . . , an+4. Depending on the point t = (a1, a2, a3) Polin Rn + 4 (x) can have (n + i) the change of the sign on I = (−1, 1), where I = 1, 4. Let Di (n (n 4) = di - many of all those points t, in which Rn+4 (x) has an even (n+i) sign of sign to I. Forms of polynomas rn+i (x) for points t ∈ Di are contained in paragraph I) Theorems 7 ([1]), I = 1, 4. We will describe everything DI here. Let the area h + consists of points (u, v) ∈ R2 in conditions: (−2u - 3) <v <(u + 1) 2 - 4)/4 with −1 <u ≤ 3, and also (−2u - 3) <v <2u - 3, for U> 3. Theorem 1. Point (A1, A2, A3) ∈ D1 (N, 4), if only if one of two points (± p, Q, ± ± ± ± r) = (u, v, w) we have W ≥ (2/27) (√ u2 - 3V - u) (u2 - 3V) + uv/9 (u, v) ∈ H +, or W ≥ | v + 1 | - u, when (u, v) /∈ H+. We put further p = —A1/2, 3q = 2a2 + (n + 2)/2, r = - (2a3 + (n + 1)/2a1), as well as ∆ = ∆ (p, q, r) = r2 + 2P (2p 2 - 3Q) R + Q2 (4Q - 3P 2). Let r = r ± (p, q) = −p (2p 2 - 3q) ± 2 (p 2 - q) 3/2, p 2 - Q q ≥ q q q ∆ <0, then equation x3 + 3px2 + 3qx + R = 0 has the roots x1 <x2 <x0. Condition (a) means: only x0 ∈ (−1, 1). Similarly, conditions (b), (v) are introduced at roots x1, x2. Requirements (a), (b), (v) are set by simple inequalities on P, Q, R, which are not given here. Theorem 2. Point (A1, A2, A3) ∈ D2 (N, 4) only in cases 1), 2): 1) with ∆ (p, q, r) <0 and condition (v) inequality 3σ2+8pσ is performed +6Q+3 ≤ −4 | σ+2p | for σ = −p+ 2 √ p 2 —q cos ((Сory+ 4π)/3), onic = arcos (s/(p 2 –q) 3/2), s = - (r - 3pq+ 2p 3 )/2; 2) The inequality (σ + p) 2 ≥ 3 (p 2 —q) + 1/2 (5) or inequality 3σ2 + 8pσ + 6q + 3 ≥ 4 | σ + 2p | ≥ 8, (6) 71 In this case in (1), (2) the value σ is selected depending on the sign ∆, more precisely: (a) with ∆> 0 and (−1 - 3p - 3q <r <1 - 3p + 3Q) B (1), (2) is taken σ + p = (s + √ ∆/2) 1/3 + (s - √ ∆/2) 1/3; (b) for ∆ = 0, if r = r+(p, q) and conditions are respected (3p - 1) (p+1)/4 <q <{p 2, −1 ≤ p <1, (3p+1 ) (P - 1)/4, p <−1, then in (1), (2) is taken σ + p = −2 √ p 2 –q, and if r = r - (p, q), then σ + P = 2 √ p 2 —q, if (3p +1) (p −1)/4 <q <{p 2, −1 <p ≤ 1, (3p - 1) (p + 1)/4, 1 <p; (c) for ∆ <0 in (1), (2) is taken σ + p = 2 √ p 2 —q cos ((Сory + 2kπ)/3), onic = arcos (s/(p 2 –q) 3 /2), where k = 0, k = 1 when performing conditions (a), (b) - respectively. Theorem 3. Point (A1, A2, A3) ∈ D4 (N, 4), (N ≥ 1), if only if 1–θ1+θ2-θ3> 0, 1+θ1+θ2+θ3> 0, 3 - ophas1-θ2 +3θ3> 0, 1– θ2 +(θ1 - θ3) θ3> 0, where θi are taken from paragraph 4) theorem 7 ([1]). After this, the point from D3 (N, 4) are set by the difference D3 (N, 4) = R3 \ (D1 ∪ D2 ∪ D4). Thus, the task of Zolotarev (1) (see [1]) was solved at L = 4. The case L = 1 examined Korkin and Zolotarev (1873), and L = 2 and L = 3 - Y. Heronimus (1935) and F. Pierstorfer [2]. The work was supported by the Russian Federation (project 01-01-00346).
