. Absolute parallel transfers to the point-often surface of A.V. Vyalov Kaliningrad State Technical University, olga_omelyan2002@mail.ru in the n-dimensional projective space PN PN-plate bone surface SH+R seems to be degenerated by the multi-mobility of triples (A, LH, TM) , moreover, the point A, (a ∈ LH ⊂ TM) and the tangent plane TM (m = h+r) describe the M-seniority, and forming LH-the R-dimensional family [1]. With the top of SH+R, the main stratification G (SH+R) is associated, the base of which is the surface itself, and the typical layer is under the group of hospital stationaries. The point-excavated surface can be represented by the stratification of LH (BR) with the base-the grace of the BR forming LH, considered as elements of the variety of the grassman GR (h, n), and the typical layer-the family point of the plane of the LH plane. Therefore, the variety of points of the fixed generator LH ⊂ SH+R is the narrowed base of the stratification G (SH+R). Group connectedness in the main stratification G (SH+R) is set using the field of connectedness γ [1]. About the composite equipment [1] of the point -thorough surface, which consists in the connection to each point of the surface of the three planes of PH -1, PM - H - 1, PN - M -1, about the point of accounting, respectively, 40 forms to the form Tangent to the plane and tangenting a bone to the overeating space. The compositional equipment of the surface is determined by the field of quasithensor λ [1]. Through external differentiation, the component of the covariant differential of Ferentsyl quasitenzor λ is built an object M, the components of which are linearly expressed through the components of the object of the cowlorous coherence of the group connectedness γ. The theorem has been proven. The object M forms a geometric object only with the fundamental object of the 1st order λ pointedly planar surface, the object of connectedness γ and the equipping quasitenzor λ, and it contains an integral under the tens of M0, including 3 simple and 3 simple dies. Comment. When narrowing the SH+R base base G (SH+R), an object M forms a tensor to a fixed gene forming LH. If the shade M0 = 0, then the parallel transfer of the commentically equipping planes of the surface of the SH+R surface along the fixed formation LH are absolute. Kit, when narrowing the base of the stratification G (SH+R), the shade of the M0 can be called the tensor of non -absolute transfers [2] or ten a zero of parallelism [3]. Along the entire surface of SH+R, parallers of the composition of the compositionally equipping planes will be absolute only in a bundle of connected type of the 2nd type [4]. L and T R A 1.

Lyapunov's codes of controlled systems A.F. Gabdrakhimov Udmurt State University, Izhevsk, Gab@udm.ru Consider the linear controlled system of differentiation ẋ = A (t) x+b (t) u, x ∈ Rn, u ∈ Rm , t ∈ R, (1) where A (·), B (·) are limited pieces of subtable to R Effective matrix functions. Let the control in the system (1) are built in the form of u = u (t) x, where u: r → mm, n is a piece of limited matrix function. Then the system (1) passes into a homogeneous system ẋ = (a (t) +b (t) u (t)) x.
