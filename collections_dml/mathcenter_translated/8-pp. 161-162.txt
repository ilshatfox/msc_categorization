)  НЕКОТОРЫЕ СВОЙСТВА РЕШЕНИЙ ПОЛУЛИНЕЙНЫХ ЭЛЛИПТИЧЕСКИХ УРАВНЕНИЙ  НА РИМАНОВЫХ МНОГООБРАЗИЯХ  Данная работа посвящена изучению поведения ограниченных решений уравнения вида  ∆u = uφ(|u|) ≡ g(u) (1)  на некомпактных римановых многообразиях, где φ(ξ) ≥ 0 — монотонно An increasing, continuously differentiated function at lection ≥ 0. Let m - arbitrary smooth coherent uncompert rimanovo variety without a edge, {bk} mmk = 1 - exhaustion of diversity m with smooth boundaries ∂bk, b ⊂ M - an arbitrary coherent compact subset with a smooth boundary and b ⊂ bk for all k. Let F1 (X) and F2 (X) - continuous limited NAM functions. We will say that the functions F1 (X) and F2 (X) are equivalent to m and denote f1 (x) ∼ f2 (x) if for some exhaustion {bk} ger = 1 variety M is the limk → → f1 ( x) - f2 (x) || C0 (m \ bk) = 0. We will say that the function W is asymptotically non -negative if there is a continuous limited function F ≥ 0 such that W ∼ F. Theorem 1. Let ∆W ≤ g (W), ∆U ≥ G (u) on m \ b, w | ∂b ≥ u | ∂b, w ∼ u. Then W ≥ U on m \ B. If ∆W = g (w) and ∆U = g (u) on m \ b and w | ∂b = u | ∂b, w ∼ u, then w = u on M \ b. Theorem 2. Let ∆W ≤ g (W), ∆U ≥ G (u) on m and w ∼ u. Then W ≥ U on m. If ∆W = G (W), ∆U = G (u) on m and w ∼ u, then w = u to m. Next, let G1, G2 - some ancestral areas of diversity M such that B ⊂ G1 and G1 ⊂ G2. Denote mi (v) = sup∂gi v, mi (v) = inf∂gi v, a + = max {0, a}, a - = min {0, a}. 161 Theorem 3. The following conditions are equivalent :) On M there is a non -viable limited solution U (x) equation (1); ) On M \ B there is a non -bearing limited solution V (X) equation (1) that satisfies the conditions M1 (V) <m2 (v +), m1 (v)> m2 (v -). Note that this statement for decisions of linear elliptical equations was obtained in [1]. L and T R A T R A 1. Grigoryan A.A., Nadirashvili N. S.

Malaanyina (Tomsk) about conformal display of circular polygons let the limited single -link region B in a complex W -plain, different from the circle. The boundary of the region B consists of the final number of arcs of concentric circles and the final number of segments lying on the rays emerging from the center of circles. The center of circles coincides with the beginning of the coordinates and belongs to the region. Region B, generally speaking, is not starry relative to the beginning of the coordinates. In the work, a differential equation was obtained regarding the function displaying a single circle to the region B. The resulting differential equation contains unknown constant, which are not directly determined by the form of the region B. We note that the areas under consideration are a special case of circular polygons, for which the corresponding differential equation relative to the displaying function, it known as the differential equation of Schwartz, 162
