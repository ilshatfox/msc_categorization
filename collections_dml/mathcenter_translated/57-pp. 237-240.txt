One analogue of the reverse theory of the theory of approximation relative to the flat measure V.P. Misyuk1 1 misiuk@grsu.by; Grodno State University named after Yankees Kupala, Grodno, Belarus considered the question of one analogue of the theorem such as Bernstein theory of rational approximation in the event of a flat measure of the Lebag. Key words: the best rational approximation, inequality such as Bernstein, reverse theorems, the space of Hard - Besov. Let M2-a flat measure of the Lebag in the complex area C, E-M2-measurable set in C. For 0 <p é φ through lp (e), we denote the space of the Lebeg Functions F on E relative to a flat measure M2 with the usual quasinore ∥ f ∥LP (E) (norm at 1 é p éicle). Namely, f ∈ LP (e), if f-m2-measured and ∥ f ∥lp (e) =  ∫ ∫ ∣∣ f (z) ∣∣p dm2 (z)  1 p <mm at 0 < p <mm, ∥ f ∥lp (e) = ess sup zlex ∣∣ f (z) ∣∣ <mm with p = inous. We will further believe that E = D = {Z ∈C: | Z | <1}. Let the function F are analytical in D. Through f̂ (k), we denote its k-na coefficient of macloren. If α ê 0, then the next function is also the analytical Jα F (Z) = ger∑ K = 0 (K +1) α F̂ (K) ZK, it is called the derivative F in the sense of Weil. Obviously, if α = l is natural, then j l f (z) = [(d d z) z] l f (z). If α <0 function Jα F is also called an integral of order | α |. Letα ∈R and 0 <p éicle, 0 <q éimes. Following the work [1] and [2], through Bαq, we denote the space of Hardy - Besov. Namely, F ∈ Bαq, if with some β> α function (1 - | z | 2) β -α - 1q · (jux F) (Z) belongs to LQ (D). Quasinorm (the norm at 1 é q é) in the space of Bαq is determined as follows 238 Materials of the School-Conference ∥ F ∥bαq = ∥∥∥∥ (1- | z | 2) β -α-1q · (Jux F) (Z ) ∥∥∥∥ lq (d) = =  ∫ d ∣∣∣∣ (1 - | z | 2) β -α - 1q · (jux f) (z) ∣∣∣∣q dm2 (z)   1 q <mm. The determination of the Bαq space does not depend on β: with various β, the corresponding quasinorms are equivalent. For the sake of convenience, as a rule, β = α+1 is believed. We say that the function F belongs to the space of Bergman1 AP (D), 0 <p é least, if it is analytical in D and the finite quasinorm ∥ f ∥AP = ∥ f ∥LP (d) (the norm at 1 é p éicle). Through RN (F, AP) = Inf rn Photrn ∥∥ f - rn∥∥ap, n = 0.1.2, ... we denote the best approximation f by means of rational functions of the degree not higher than n. Next, we give some information from the theory of interpolation spaces. Let the X0 and X1 be compatible quasinomated abelevs of groups in order [4]. For x ∈ X0 +X1, we introduce K -functional Ya. Petra K (t) = Inf {∥x0∥x0 +t ∥x1∥x1: x0 +x1 = x, x0 ∈ X0, x1 ∈ X1}, t> 0, where ∥ · ∥xs (s = 0, 1) is a quasinorm in XS. We denote through (·, ·) θ, q (0 <θ <1, 0 <q éicle) the interpolation function of J. Peter [4]. Exactly, x ∈ (x0, x1) θ, q = xθ, q, if ∥x∥xθ, q =  ∫ µ 0 (t --θ k (t)) q d t t  1 q <mm with q ̸ = = ∞, ∥x∥xθ, urb = sup t> 0 t --θ k (t). Following Y. Peter [4] - [6], we introduce the approximation space Rαp, Q = Rαq (AP): = {F ∈ AP: ∥ F ∥RαP, Q <mm}, α> 0; p, q ∈ (0, φ], where ∥ f ∥rαp, Q: = [ger∑ k = 0 1 n (n α+ 1p rn (f, ap) q] 1q, q ̸ = urb, 1 sometimes This space is called the space of M.M. Drzhbashyan. Here we will accept the name of the Bergman's space, because it is most often found in the literature. V.R. Misyuk 239 ∥ f ∥rαp, φ: = Sup nê1 n α+ 1p rn rn (F, AP), q = φ. Theorem 1. [3]. Let 0 <α0, α1, σ0, σ1 <mm, 0 <θ <1, α = (1–θ) α0 +θα1 and 1 σ = 1–θ σ0 + θ σ1. Then (bα0σ0, b α1 σ1) θ, q = bασ. Theorem 1 is well known for 1 éσ0, σ1, q0, q1 é least (see, for example, [4], chap. 6 ). From the point of view of generalized functions in the material case, it was obtained in the books of Y. Peter [7] and H. Table [6]. For analytical functions, this theorem was proved by A.A. Pekarsky [3] excellent from the methods used in [4 ], [7], [6]. Theorem 2. [4], [5]. Let 0 <p, q0, q1 é ughter, 0 <α0, α1 <mm, and α0 ̸ = α1, 0 <θ <θ 1 and α = (1-θ) α0 +θα1. Then (r α0 p, q0, r α1 p, q1) θ, q = rαp, q. Following theorems 1 and 2, and also [8], we come to the following The statement of theorem 3. Let 2 <p <و, and 1 q = α+ 2 p. Then there is an investmentrαq, p ⊂ bαq.
