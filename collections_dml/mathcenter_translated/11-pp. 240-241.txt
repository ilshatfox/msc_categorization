The influence of the involutional shift and on the asymptotic properties of solving the Koshi problem in the report, the equation of hyperbolic tish ~ is considered. : d2 and (x, y) d d +(x, 11) +t: it (c-x, y) = o, (z :, y) e r 2, l, her r. (1) X at uraNNISHING (1) is an equation with a deviant Argu Mop C - Z: = x + A (x). Deviation A (x) = C - 2x changes the sign when crossing through the line x = s/2. D Work (1] The Rena of its own deviations of this type. The Riman method was obtained by the solution of the Koshi problem for (1) and the asymptotics of the obtained decision on the endlessly. The results are formulated in the form of theorem 1. Let Re C 2 (R) , V e c 1 (r). Then solved the problem of the Koshi II e c2 (r2) J.1.

Note that in the work [2) for a hurrical (1) with an involving shift (y, z;), decisions of two for. Daching with non -butter conditions were obtained. 240 Literature 1. Andreev A.A.
