To prove that there is the only solution to equation (1) that satisfies the requirements: u (x, y) ∈ C (ḡa) ∩m (ḡa), ux (x, y), uy (x, y), uxy (x, uxy (x, uxy (x, uxy y) ∈ C (GA), u (x, x) = τ (x), +ger∫ x t - truck (x, t) dt = ρ (x), x ∈ [a; +Urb), 202 where R> 1. Using a number of properties of special hypergeometry functions and solving the integral equation of Abel with the infinite upper limit, the following theorem has been proven. If τ (x) ∈ C [a,+و) ∩m [a,+inous), τ ′ (x) ∈ C (A,+urb), and function R (x) = ρ (x)+x 1 −r 1 --r τ (x) is such that r (x) = r0 (x) x δ0, r ′ (x) = r1 (x) xδ1, r ′ ′ (x) = r2 (x) xδ2, where Ri (x) ∈ C [a,+و) ∩ m [a,+φ), δi <i, i = 0, 2, r> 2+α, the only solution to the problem is determined by the formula U (x, y) = τ (x) + (r - 1) y∫ x tα + r - 2 (t - x) d dt (t1 --αr ′ (t)) × × f (1 - α, 2 - r; 2; - x x) dt + r - 1 2b (2 + α, 1– α) (y - x) 1 + α xr -2 × + nder∫ y tα (t - x) −α d dt (t1 --αr ′ (t)) × × f1 (1 + α, α, 2 - r; 2 + α; y - x t - x, y - x - x) dt. V.V. Sylvestrov (Cheboksary) about one mixed task of elastic theory for a piece-a-native body with a straightforward section considers the task of a flat theory of elasticity about the rigid linear inclusion, located on the straightforward border of the section of two environments. One of the aspects of the inclusion is rigidly connected to the medium, and the other is in a state of sliding contact. Mathematically the task is to build in the plane of the complex alternating z two pieces of piece-headerfic functions φ (z), ω (z) with a line of break on the segment L, coinciding with the inclusion, according to the regional conditions IM [φ + (t) + ω-(t )] = –Q (t), 203
