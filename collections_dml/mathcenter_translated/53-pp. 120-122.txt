The laminar Dynamo is considered the task of moving the conductive viscous fluid between the non -center rotating sphere. It is believed that the center of symmetry of the internal sphere of shifts of the chickpeas relative to the center of the external sphere in the equatorial plane at a short distance. Within the framework of this model, the solution of the problem of hydrodynamics that does not take into account the influence of the magnetic field on the movement of fluid allows you to obtain a radial course [1]. In this paper, the question of the possibility of generating a magnetic field by the fluid by the fluid found in [1]. We write down the equations of magnetic hydrodynamics [2] in the ends of measured form: ε rot (∂ ~ v ∂t + (~ v, ▽) ~ v) = s rot (~ h, ▽) ~ h + rot ~ v, (1) ∂ ~ h ∂t = rm rot [~ v, ~ h] +△ ~ h, (2) div ~ v = 0, (3) div ~ h = 0, (4) V. V. Novikov, L.N. . February 121 Where ε = C2 4πσν, S = I2σ ρνC2, rm = 4πσV ∗ r c2, t ∗ = 4πσr2 c2, r is the scale of the length, t ∗ - the scale of the current, I - the scale of the current, v ∗ - characteristic flow rate. The conditions of a small parameters ε ≪ 1, s ≪ 1 allow you to neglect nonlinear members in (1) and reduce the system (1)-(3) to the sequential solution: 1. The equations of hydrodynamics (1), (3) without taking into account the influence of the mage of the native field on The movement of the fluid considered in [1], 2. The equations of induction (2) together with the equation of inequality (4) with a certain course of ~ v. The solution of equations (2), (4) is searched in the form of a row according to the ball vectors [2]: ~ h (r, θ, ∗) = eλt ∑ l = 1.2, ..., | m | 6l (ψ+lm (r) ~ y +lm +ψ 0 lm (r) ~ y 0lm +ψ - lm (r) ~ y −lm). By grouping the coefficients in front of ball vectors with the same indices, we get a system of ordinary differential linear linear equations relative to radial functions ψ+ LM (R). After replacing derived with diverse analogues, the task boils down to finding the λk of the truncated system. Of interest is the value of λ ∗ with the greatest active part. Dependence λ ∗ on the magnetic number of Reynolds RM for l = 1, 2 is built. The critical value of RKP.m is established, in which the actual part λ ∗ becomes positive. In this case, the magnetic field is excited [3]. For l = 1, the value of rkp.m ≈ 32, for l = 2 value rkp.m ≈ 29. 122 P.A.
