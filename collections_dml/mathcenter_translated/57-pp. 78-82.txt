Materials of the School-Conference under the same condition (3) consider the linear equation [1] D 1–γ 0+ F (x) = A (x) f (x)+ f (x). (4) In particular, the case of the coefficient A (x) = A0XS is of interest. It is assumed that this equation has a solution F (x), and d1 --γ0+ f ∈C (−1+ γ) ([0.1]). Theorem 3. Let F ∈C (−1+γ) ([0,1]). Then the solution F equation (4) belongs to the space C (0) ([0.1]). When fulfilling the conditions of theorem 3, the solution of equation (4) is a continuous solution to the integral equation f (x) = 1 γ (1–γ) ∫ x 0 a (t) d t (x - t) γ + 1 γ (1 - γ) ∫ x 0 f (t) d t (x - t) γ. Note that the study of linear equations can serve as a basis for studying nonlinear equations, when in the right side of the equation (4) f = f (x, f). Literature 1. Samko S. G., Kilbas A.

Kutaib2 1 vbv57@inbox.ru; Belgorod State National Research University 2 1167542@bsu.edu.ru; The Belgorod State National Research University The article discusses some regional tasks for elliptical pseudo -diodecture equations in the cone and discusses the question of the behavior of the solution of the regional problem, when the cone solution strives for zero. In the particular case, it is shown that such a limit exists only if the boundary function of the satisfied functional syngular integral equation. V.B. Vasiliev, Sh.Kh.

Model regional tasks in the theory of pseudo -diodecture equations and marginal tasks on the varieties of Printing role are played by the study of model equations and regional tasks in canonical areas [1-3]. There are many different approaches to the study of model situations, however, here we use a special factorization of an elliptical symbol, called the first author of the wave [1]. Consider the simplest cone C A+ = {x ∈RM: x = (x ′, xm), xm> a | x ′ |, a> 0} and show what the role of the above -described functions in the design of the solution of the pseudo -dyspheneral equation (Au+) (x) (x ) = f (x), x ∈C a+, (1) in the space H s (C A+) and the right part from H S --α 0 (C A+), provided for the symbol A (cil) [2, 5, 6] c1 (1+ | ă) α ≤ | a (lection) | ≤ c2 (1+ | ₽ |) α in the assumption that the symbol allows a wave factorization relative to C A+ [1, 3] A (lection) = A ̸ = (lection) · A = (lection) with an index . The structure of the solution of equation (1) in the case  - S = n +δ, n ∈ N, | Δ | <1/2 is known, and in the simplest case n = 1, f ≡ 0, it looks as follows ũ+(hole) = a - 1̸ = (ă) ∫ rm - 1 –2m - 1πm -22 γ (m/2) c̃1 C̃1 (η ′) dη ′ (μ1 —η1) 2 + (₽2 --η2) 2 + · · · (ising - 1 - tip - 1) 2 —A2urb) m/2, (2) where C1 is an arbitrary function from the corresponding space of Sobolev - Slobodetsky [8]. In formula (2) there is one arbitrary function and, if you fix it, the solution will become the only one. For its unambiguous definition, it is necessary to supplement the equation with an additional (boundary) condition, as a result of which we will get some kind of regional task. The easiest way is the task with an integral boundary condition of+φ∫ 0 u+(x ′, xm) d xm = g (x ′), (3) which in the images of Fourier takes the form ũ+(ă ′, 0) = g̃ (₽ ′ ). (4) by substituting (4) B (2), we obtain the following integral equation for the one’s function C̃1∫ rm - 1 –A2M -1πm -22 γ (m/2) C̃1 (η ′) Dη ′ ((ξ1 —η1) 2 + (₽2 —η2) 2 + · · + (ξM - 1 - tip - 1) 2) m/2 = a ̸ = (ă ′, 0) g̃ (₽ ′). (5) 80 Materials of the School-Conference in Formula (5) The core of the integral has a strong feature at zero, and the integral is understood in some generalized sense. Since the right part of the equation (5) is known, and the left is essentially a bundle, you can apply (opposite) conversion of Fourier. According to the calculations [4], p. 451, we get the following expression ABMC1 (x ′) | x ′ | = ∫ rm -1 m (x ′ - y ′) g (y ′) d y ′, (6) where the constant BM depends only on the dimension m, m (x ′) = f -11 edge ′ → x ′ a ̸ = ( cil ′, 0). Thus, from formula (6), the function C1 (x ′) is determined unambiguously. Therefore, the marginal task (1), (3) has the only solution. To set the condition of the conductor for the general decision U+ on the border of the ∂c a+ cone in a convenient form, we should perform some transformations. If we apply the transformation of TA [6, 7] to the solution of u+, we get a function (TAU+) (x) specified on RM+. So
