The decision of one endedly inclusion with a positively defined matrix and a diagonal multi -digit operator 1 S.M. Avdyakova, A.V. Lapin Kazan State University, Kazan Annotation in the SpaceRn We will consider the task: Find a couple of vectors (u, γ), such that Au+Bγ = F, γ ∈ Cu, (p) where a is a positively defined matrix, (0.1) b, (0.1) b. -M-matrix, (0.2) C-diagonal as monotonous operator: cu = (c1 (u1), c2 (u2),., Cn (un)). (0.3) The theorem of the existence of a solution has been proved and iterative methods for solving the problem (p) were proposed. As an example of the task (p), the net approximation of the coherent system - the elliptical equation and inclusion is considered. The results of numerical calculations are given. 1 Introduction The task (p) In a particular case of the diagonal M -brutal B: B = = Diag (b11., BNN) ≡ b0, BII> 0, comes down to classical variation inequality (AU, v -u) + onic (v) - ∗ (u)> (f, v - u). Here ∗ (u) = ∑n i = 1 ∗ (ui) is a sepaable convex function on the ONAL, such that ∂ices (UI) = BII · Ci (UI), A (.,.) - scalar work in RN. This variation inequality with a positively 1 work was carried out with the support of the RFFI, project No. 01-01-0070 89 The decision of one endless inclusion. . . A specific matrix A has the only solution and various classes of iterative methods have been studied for it (see review of [1]). For the task (p), when both matrices A and B are M -matrixes, the issues of existence and uniqueness of the solution, as well as the convergence of iterative methods of the relaxation type are investigated in work [2.3]. The basis of these studies is the so -called theory of comparison, for the fairness of which the property of the M -meters is necessary. As applications of the results, the net approximation of the task of Stefan with the prescribed convection and the task of the dam are considered. In both cases, the matrix A corresponds to the grid approximation of the Laplace operator, while B is responsible for the opposite approximation of convective terms. As is well known, the stiffness matrix A during the approximation of the Laplace operator by the method of final elements is a M -matrix with sufficiently rigid restrictions on triangulation (condition of the "acute angle") and the procedure for approximation (first). It is clear that during the approximation of an elliptical operator with mixed derivatives, we also lose the property of a as a M - Motracles. All this serves as the basis for studying the task (p) in the case when a is not a M -matrix, but has the property of positive certainty. 2 The theorem of existence Consider the task (p): au+bγ = f, γ ∈ Cu, under conditions (0.1) - (0.3). At first we will consider the following additional condition: the image of the operator C is limited, that is, the vector γ belongs to a limited parallelepiped ∏ = n∏ i = 1 [γimin, γimax]. (2.1) Theorem 2.1. In conditions (0.1) - (0.3) and (2.1) the task (p) has a solution. 90 S.M. Avdyakova, A.V. Lapin proof. Let b = b0 - b1, where the b0 is the diagonal part of the matrix b, b1 à 0. Denote γ̃ = b0γ, even if d = (b0c) −1 is the diagonal as monotonous operator with the determination area DOMD = ∏N I = 1 [BIIγimin, BIIγIMAX] ≡ ∏̃. The initial task (p) can be written in an equivalent form: u +a - 1γ̃ = a -1b1b −1 0 γ̃ +a −1f, u ∈ Dγ̃. (2.2), along with (2.2) the auxiliary task dγ̃ +a -1γ̃ 3 a -1b1b - 10 ₽ +a - 11f (2.3) for ă ∈ ∏̃. Since the matrix A -1 is positively determined: (A -1γ, γ) α‖γ‖2, variational inequality (2.3) has the only solution γ̃ ∈ ∏̃, that is, the operator G: γ̃ = gising, acting from ∏, is determined from ∏ ̃ in ∏̃. It is easy to prove that he is continuously lips. Indeed, from (2.3), taking into account the monotony D and the positive certainty of A -1, α‖ γ̃1 - γ̃2‖2 6 (dγ̃1 --dγ̃2, γ̃1 - γ̃2) + (a -1 (γ̃1 - γ̃2), γ̃1 - γ̃2) 6 follows 6 ‖A -1b1b - 10 ‖‖ Answers - oring. According to Brower's theorem, the continuous display G of the convex lump of the pact ∏̃ in itself has a fixed point: γ̃ = gγ̃. Thus, there is a solution to the inclusion of dγ̃ +a -1γ̃ 3 a -1b1b - 10 γ̃ +a -1f or, equivalent, tasks (2.2), which means, and tasks (p). Remark 2.1. Suppose now that we know the boundaries for the components of the γ solution of the problem (p), that is, we are looking for a solution (u, γ), such that γ ∈ ∏ = ∏n i = 1 [γimin, γimax]. In this case, we can modify the operator C so that it satisfies the condition (2.1). Indeed, let the one -dimensional maximum monotonous CI operator accepts the γimax value at some point U ∗ I for fixed I. In particular, U ∗ i can be a point of multi -digitality Ci and γimax ∈ Ci (U ∗ i). In this case, we put C̃i (u ∗ i) = γimax for ui> u ∗ i, and if 91 is the solution of one final inclusion. . . Ci (U ∗ i) is a gap [γ 1 i, γ 2 i] with γ 2 i 6 +urb, put C̃i (u ∗ i) = [γ 1 i, γimax]. We carry out similar transformations for γi 6 γimin if CI accepts the γimin value. As a result, we get the most monotonous operator C, satisfying the condition (2.1). According to the construction of DOM C̃ 6 DOMC and on DOM C̃ operators C and C̃ coincide. Solving the problem a
