) The construction of a model wing profile with a purely circulation flow is proposed a simple method for constructing a model profile, on which a purely circulation flow of an ideal inconsistent fluid is implemented. As a comprehensive potential of the flow of such a profile, the complex potential is used from a vortex -resistant placed in a plane -parallel stream, W (z) = Q - Imb 2π ln z + vift, where Q is the abundance of the source, γ - the circulation of the vortex and vimate - the speed of the incurred stream. At the same time, part of one of the current lines of such a course is taken over the profile circuit. As a result, the contour of the profile, which has the shape of a “snail”, through the hole in which the flow is carried out. On the basis of numerical calculations, various forms of such profiles were found depending on the ratio of the vortex circulation and the abundance of the source. An analysis of the nature of the course was also carried out depending on the location of the gap on the profile circuit. The optimal value of the initial parameters was found, in which the flow of the largest part of the circuit occurs without separation of the border layer.
