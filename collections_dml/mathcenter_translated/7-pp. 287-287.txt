. Modified relative phase permeability in the model of the “scheme of jets” V.Ya. Bulyriv, I.T. Usmanov Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics named after N.G. Chebotarev Kazan State University 420008, Kazan, ul. University, 17 Considers the behavior of modified relative phase permeability (OFP) within the framework of the "scheme of jets" [LJ, [2). According to the “scheme of the jets”, modified OFP are presented in the form of k but k n k ~ = --bq jk (z} iz, kf1 = _! IQ jk (z} iz, kn = jk (z) dz. But o, depending on the distribution of permeability (their behavior was considered, depending on the reverse of the z (k) in the same interval of permeability changes [K 1, to 2]) various modified OFPs are obtained. The calculated indicators of development of the development of Models of the "scheme of jets" adapted to actual using modified OFP. This research allows you to choose various types of curves of the OFP. Literature 1. Bulygin V.Ya. oil layout. - M.: Nedra, 1974. 232 p. 2 . Bulyrin D.V., Bulygin V.Ya.
