The impact of sea waves on the barriers of Yu.Z. Aleshkov St. Petersburg State University by the will of Peter I and the decision of the Boyarsky Duma of October 20, 1696: to be sea vessels, Russia created the sea fleet and mastered the expanses of the pestilence. In order to base the fleet and its engineering support, ports were built, mooring and protective structures were built. After the Second World War (1939 - 1945), the process of mastering the oceans accelerated. The construction of hydraulic structures on the shelf has unfolded. In this regard, scientific support for marine hydraulic structures was of great importance. A significant role in creating methods for calculating wave loads on through structures and the organization of scientific research in the field of marine hydraulic engineering was played by Dorofei Dmitrievich Lappo (1918 - 2000), [1]. The mathematical formulation of the problem of the effect of fluid on solid surfaces was given to Ayler and Lagrange [2, 3, 4]. Koshi and Poisson considered the question of waves on the surface of heavy fluid from initial indignation in the linear setting of the task. Stox, A.I. Nekrasov, Levi-Chivita built a solution to the corresponding nonlinear problem of running waves [5]. ME AND. The Seerzhenkovich developed a nonlinear theory of standing waves [6]. The hydrodynamic task of the effects of waves on obstacles located in a layer of heavy fluid will be considered in the following assumptions: the fluid is perfect, homogeneous, its movement is vicious. The movement of the liquid is determined relative to the axes, x y z, believing that the plane, x y coincides with the free surface in its uninocated state, the axis Z is directed vertically upwards. The vicious movement of the fluid is described using the velocity potential (,,,,) x y z ther ng =, so that speed v ng = ∇. The velocity potential satisfies the equation of Laplace 0 accord 0ices, and the pressure is determined by the integral of Lagranzakoshi 21 (), 2T P GZ F Tusion ρ + ∇ + + = Aleshkov Yu.Z. 6 where ρ is the density of the liquid; G - acceleration of gravity; () F T - an arbitrary function of time. On the free surface of the liquid (,,, z x y tζ = there is a kinematic and dynamic conditions 02, (,,,,,,), 1 t p p x y t n ϕ ζ ζ ∂ ∂ = ∂ + ∇ where n - orth normal to the surface; 0 (,,) p x y t is a given function that determines the pressure on the free surface. These conditions can be given form 2 01, () ,. 2t z t p g f t zζ Сζ ζ С С ϕ ζ ρ ρ ∇ ∇ ⋅∇ = + ∇ + = = at the bottom (,) z h x y = - the condition of the non -use of 0n 8∂ =, which takes type 0, .zh z h specific ∇ ⋅∇ + = = - if there is an obstacle in the layer of liquid between the free surface and the bottom, then on the surface s of this obstacle it is necessary to take into account the conditions of non -treatment. In the case of a fixed barrier, we have 0n 8∂ ∂ =, (,,) x y z sorn. At 2 2 0x Y+ → Functions ζ, ∗ must be limited. At the initial moment, ζ and v ng = ∇ are set. A feature of the formulated initial-stringly task of the theory of potential that simulates the wave movement of the liquid and its interaction with obstacles (if S is the unification of surfaces, 1, 2, is i n =) is the fact that the solution of the decision is unknown, and the unknown part of the border is unknown in advance. - Free surface - carries non -linear conditions. Due to the complexity of the task, its linear version is considered, when the conditions on the free surface have the form of the effects of sea waves on the barrier 7 0 01,, 0.tt z t p g z t g g g g С ζ ζ ρ ∂ + = - = - - = ∂ Next, we consider the case horizontal bottom constH = and cylindrical barriers with a vertical generating (COS (,) n z). Then the condition of non -treatment on the barrier will take the form COS () COS () 0, x yn x n y accord+ = (,,) x y z s than. With 0 ConstP = the task will be homogeneous. This corresponds to the case of free waves. The wave movement of the fluid for a free wave, not distorted by the obstacle, is described by the velocity potential [] ch () sin (cos sin), CH AG K z h k x y t k α α ω ε ωicle + = + - + where a is amplitte; k is a wave number; ω - frequency, 2 thgk khω =; α - direction of distribution; ε - phase.

The task of determining F is to find the solution of the Helmholtz equation, satisfying the condition of the neutin on the circuit l and the condition of the radiation. Aleshkov Yu.Z. 8 Function F has a different structure depending on whether the barrier extends in the horizontal plane to infinity or not. If the circuit l does not go into infinity, then f f’s = +, where the first term [] exp (cos sin
