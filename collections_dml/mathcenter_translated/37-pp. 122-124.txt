Reviewed cosmological solutions for Fermi systems with scalar interaction of particles in [1], [2] shows that the correct introduction of scalar interaction of particles into a kinetic theory leads to a change in the effective masses of particles: m ∗ = | m + qφ | where Q is the scaly Particle charge, φ is the potential of the scalar field. In this work, we study a special case of cosmological solutions when the tensor of energy-pulse is determined by the statistical system of fully degenerated enzymes with a scalar charge Q. In [3] it was shown that in this case the energy density and pressure are represented in elementary functions: EF = m4 ∗ 8π2 [ψ √ 1 + ψ2 (1 + 2ψ2) - ln (ψ + √ 1 + ψ2)], 123 pf = m4 ∗ 24π2 [ψ √ 1 + ψ2 (2ψ2 - 3) + 3 ln (ψ + √ 1 + ψ2)], t = ef - 3pf = m4 ∗ 2π2 [ψ √ 1 + ψ2 - ln (ψ + √ 1 + 1 + 1 + ψ2)]], σ = Q · m3 ∗ 2π2 [√ √ 1 + ψ2 - ln (ψ + √ 1 + ψ2)], where ψ = pf /| m ∗ | - The attitude of the Fermi impulse to the effective mass, σ is the scalar density of charges (see [3]). Consider the obtained system in the flat model of Friedman with a metric DS2 = DT2 - A2 (T) (DX2 + DY2 + DZ2). The tensor of the energy-pulse of the scalar field has the form of an energy-immoral energy tensor of ideal fluid: ES = 1 8π (φ̇2 + µ2Sφ 2), PS = 1 8π (1 3 φ̇2-µ2Sφ2). Einstein equations with a scalar source: 3 ȧ2 a2 = 8πε, 3 ȧ a = - ε̇ ε + p. Consider the maximum ratios for the macroscopic values ​​of the density of energy and pressure in the case of ψ → φ: EF = 1 4 m4β4 A4π2; PF = 1 12 m4β4 A4π2; ES = −PS = µ2S 8π φ2. In this case, the second of Einstein's equations turns to identity. As a result, the cosmological situation is described by two equations relative to the functions φ (t), a (t), namely, the equation of the scalar field and the einstein equation: d dt (a2 dart dt) + µ2sa 4φ = −4πσ, 124 3 ȧ a = 8π (8π (8π (8π ( M4β4 4π2a4 + µ2φ2 8π). The work provides a study of the resulting system. L and T R A T R A 1. Ignatiev.g. // Izv. universities. Physics. - 1983. - T. 24. - No. 8. - C. 15. 2.

Lobachevsky, miov6@yandex.ru about one model of economic development, taking into account the “external effect” of human capital, the generalized model of the Lukas R. [1] economic development of the two -section economic system is studied, which includes the production sector and the sector that forms "human capital". The concept of human capital can be interpreted as a set of knowledge, skills and other qualities of an employee that increase the effectiveness of his contribution to the production process [2]. The level of human capital of a representative economic agent is denoted by h (t), and a share of its active time 125
