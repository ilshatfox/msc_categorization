Integral equations in the spaces of almost-periodic functions in the report presented the following results 1) the regional task of the riman for the strip and the half-pierce of the bone is solved and the characteristic singular equia + C (t) + b (t_) J IP (r) are studied. DR = F (t), -OO <t <oo, 7p r -t -00 +oo ~; Â· IP (r) DR = f (t), -O <t <oo, 7g ~ r -t in the class almost- periodic functions in the sense of boron. 2) The compactness of the integrated operators of the type +t kip = lim 1t J k (t, s) IP (s) ds T-> OO 2-T 164 mfs is shown. Kulagina in the spaces of the almost-periodic functions of Bezikovich. For integral equations of the second kind with such opera Torah, an analogue of the alternative to Fredgolm has been proven. 3) A generally dysfurne of Fourier has been introduced and studied in space B2, which in each almost-period of the dying function puts its Fourier in accordance with [LJ, [2]. With the help of this transformation, some of the inkal equations of the type of first and second kinds are resolved. For example: +t. 1 / [cp (t) + l1m -t k (t -t) cr (t) dt = f (t), t -oo 2. -T +t. one ! 1cp (t) +} ~ m00 2t (a (t - t) + b (t - t)] <p (t) dt = f (t), -t literature 1. Kulagina M.
