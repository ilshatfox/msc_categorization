UDC 517.544 Analogue of the formula of the Ostrograd-Liwill formula for ordinary linear differential tutors in the theory of the task of linear conjugation for the piece of an analytical vector S.N. Kiyasov1 1 sergey.kijasov@kpfu.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University conducted an analogy between the theory of ordinary linear differential equations and the theory of the task of a linear conjugation for a piece-analytical vector. Keywords: matrix-function, task of linear conjugation, factorization. In the course of ordinary differential equations, the substantiation of the formula of the Ostrograd-Luville is justified, according to which if a linear homogeneous equation with continuous coefficients Y (N) +A1 (X) Y (N-1) +· · · +AN-1 (X) Y ′ +an (x) y = 0 of order n is known N −1 linearly independent solution Y1 (x) ,. . . , yn-1 (x), then the function y (x), which complements this system of solutions to the fundamental one, can be determined by the method of variation of constant as the solution of the heterogeneous linear equalization 180 materials of the school-conference of the order of the order n −1: ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∣ y1 (x). . . yn -1 (x) y (x) y ′ 1 (x). . . y ′ n -1 (x) y ′ (x). . . . . . . . . . . . y (n - 1) 1 (x). . . y (n - 1) n -1 (x) y (n - 1) (x) ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ = cE - ∫ x x0 a1 (t) dt, where C is some constant, and functions Y1 (x) ,. . . , yn -1 (x) constitute a fundamental system of solutions of the corresponding homogeneous equation. Let γ is a simple smooth closed contour that breaks the plane of the complex alternating into two areas d+ and d - (0 ∈ D+, φ ∈ D -), G (t) - h– continuous on γ Matrix - function of order n, detg (t) ̸ = 0, t ∈ γ. A homogeneous task of linear conjugation for the N - Mortal vector (the vector task of Riman -Gilbert) is to find the piece -analytical vector - the function W (z) = (W1 (Z), W2 (Z),., Wn (Z)) the given order at the infinity C H - continuous at γ limit values ​​W ± (t), associated with the condition w+(t) = G (t) W - (t). (1) Suppose that this task has N −1 solution without the final poles Wi (Z) = (W1I (Z), W 2 I (Z),., W N I (Z)), I = 1, N −1, (2) having some orders of the orders of Ki, I = 1, N −1, respectively (a positive order means the pole order). The desired canonical system of solutions to the problem we denote vk (z) = (v1k (z), v 2 k (z),., V n k (z)), k = 1, n (3) (vk (z) has an infinity Order (— − − − — K = 1, N). Integers åk - private indices of the matrix - function g (t) - we will consider streamlined in descending å1 ≥ ≥2 ≥ · ≥ å å å å2 +· · +· +ån = å = inddetg (t) - the total index G ( t)). In [1], a formula (analogue of the formula of Ostrogradsky-Liwill) was obtained, which, in the case of a zero total index, has the type of V1 K (Z) W11 (Z). . . W 1 n -1 (Z) V2 K (Z) W21 (Z). . .

(4) here PK (Z) - some polynomes expressed through the decomposition coefficients (2) according to the functions of the canonical system of solutions (3) (in the case of å = 0, Detg (τ) is replaced by τ - τ), and Before the exponent in z ∈ D, the multiplier Z - å &) should be put). Using the formula (4), and introducing a new unknown vector-function, with certain assumptions regarding solutions (2), the task (1) is given to (N-1)-a dimensional heterogeneous task of linear conjugation with the matrix-function of the analytically continued in the D+region, From which the components of the corresponding function VK (Z) of the canonical solutions system (3) were obtained for (N −1). The presentation for the remaining components follows from the formula (4). S.B. Clement 181 provides grades for the degrees of vague polynomas PK (Z), K = 1, N, and the system of constructing the system (3) is indicated. Note that the result of this type, based on the “operator approach” to the study of the problem (1), was obtained in [2]. Literature 1. Kiyasov S. N.
