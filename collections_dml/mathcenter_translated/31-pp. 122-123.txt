Symmetry of fundamental objects of the surface in the space of projective connectedness of K.V. Polyakov Russian State University named after I. Kant Kaliningrad, olesya@epc.albertina.ru We determine the space of projective connectedness pn, n with the nm-layers and the N-dimensional base using a system of forms of pfuffa ωi, ωij, ωi (i, j, k = 1,.. with structural equations dωi = ωj ∧ ωij + 1 2 ri0jkω j ∧ ωk, (1) dωij = ω k j ∧ ωik + (δijωk + δikωj) ∧ ωk + 1 2 rijklω k ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ∧ ω j ∧ ∧ ωωj + 1 2 rijkω j ∧ ωk. It is shown that the curvature tensor r = {ri0jk, rijkl, rijk} 123
