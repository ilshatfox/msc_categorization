For one hyperbolic type equation with a continuous coefficient, consider the Uxy - λf (Y) U = 0 (1) equation G = G - ∪g+, where g - = {(x, y) | - h <x <0, - x <y <h}, g+ = {(x, y) | 0 <x <h, 0 <y <h - x}. The task is ∆2. Find the function u (x, y) that meets the conditions: 1) u (x, y) ∈ C (G), uxy ∈ C (G); 2) u (x, y) - the solution of equation (1) on the set G; 3) u (x, h) = ω (x), x ∈ [—h; 0]; 4) u (x, 0) = ψ (x), x ∈ [0; h]; 116 5) lim x → −0 x∫ −y (x - t) −λ1 (−t) r1 u (t, y) dt = = b lim x →+0 h - y∫ x (t - x) - λ2 tr2u (t, y) dt, where 0 <λi <1, λi <ri, i = 1.2, b ∈ R, b 6 = 0, 0 <y <h. Theorem. If ω (x) ∈ C1 [--h; 0], ψ (x) ∈ C1 [0; h], ω (0) = ψ (0) = 0, b> 0, ri - λi ≥ 2, i = I = 1.2, λ <0, | λ | mh2 <1, m = max [0; h] f (y), f (y) ∈ C [0; h], f (y)> 0, then there is only The solution to the problem is ∆2. Proof of the uniqueness of the solution of the problem ∆2 is based on the principles of local extremum proven by the author. The existence of a solution to the problem ∆2 was equivalent to the existence of a solution to the integral equation of Fredgolm II with a regular nucleus and a continuous right -hand part, whose theory is known (see [1]).
