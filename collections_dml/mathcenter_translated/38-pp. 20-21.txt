The procedure for the growth of sequences of double rectangular sums of Fourier let {nk} k :: 1 - an arbitrary sequence of naval numbers. K. I. Oskolkov [1] Proof that for the sequence of SNK (J, x) the sequence of partial amounts of the trigonometric series Fourier of the arbitrary function F e l [o, 27g) Assessment SNK (F, X) = O (lNK ) p. c. Consider a two -dimensional case. We denote through · SM, Nu, X, y) the value (m, p) the rectangular partial sum of the double trigonometric series of Fourier function F e l [o, 27g) 2 at the point (x, y) E [o, 27g) 2. G. A. Karagulian [2j received the following two -dimensional analogue of Oskolkov’s estimates: for any sequences of natural numbers {mk} ~ 1, {nk} k: 1 and for each function F E LLN+ L (O, 27g) 2 SMK, PK ( f, x, y) = o (ln2 k) p. We received the following statement. Theorem. Empty {mk} k: 1, {nk} k:, 1 - nro -~ e after the duteliness of the nursing, 'f: [o, +oo) ~ [o, +oo) 00 is unnecessary.
