Periodic operators are denoted through the BCN (R1) space of continuous and limited functions X: R1 → CN, ‖X‖ = SUP Tusion (T) ‖CN. The operators of the species p̃ x = ger −mm (t, s) x (s), (1) where p (t, s) = {pij (t, s)} - intensified n × are considered in BCN (R1). N-matrix, which has a variation limited to R1 with each T ∈ R1, continuously on the left by S and satisfying the conditions: Lim S → –M (T, S) = 0, LIM H → 0 ger V −mm [Pij (t + h, s) - pij (t, s)] = 0, i, j = 1, n; P (t + ω, s + ω) = p (t, s), ω> 0, sup tgr1 max 1≤n n∑ j = 1 و V −mm pij (t, s) <mm. (2) The space of such operators with the norm determined by the ratio (2) is denoted by π̃. Through we will designate the BCN (R1) space or one of its following subspaces: BCNU (R 1), APN (R1) - spaces evenly continuous, respectively, almost periodic functions in the bore; Pn (ω) = {x: x (t + ω) = x (t)}, cn0 (r1) = {x: lim | t | → φ x (t) = 0}, aapn (r1) = cn0 (cn0 (r1) R 1) ⊕ aapn (r1), APN (ω) = cN0 (r 1) ⊕ pn (ω). It is easy to see that all of the listed spaces are invariant regarding the operators from π̃. Everywhere below x 6 = pn (ω). Theorem. Let X1 be a closed subspace of space X, which has the final innermost (in x). If for each F ∈ X1 the equation (i - p̃) x = f has a solution x ∈ BCN (R1), then the operator I - p̃ will turn in all of the listed spaces X. 186. If the I-P̃ D-Normal operator is in one of the spaces of X, then he will turn in all of the listed spaces of the X. L and T R A T R A 1. Pulyaev V.F.
