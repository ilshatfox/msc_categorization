The close solution of the generalized fractional-integrated equation is this work of the post-by-close methods of solving the integro-operational equation A <p = 1 + ig (<p; t) + t (<p; t) = f (t), o :::: ; T ::::; one; (1) here is 1 - the desired parameter, <p (t) - the desired function, the if (<p; t) - the fractional integral of the riman - the Liuville of the order about ~ a ~ 1 from the function <p (t) (see, for example, [1)), f (t) - for this continuous function, T - a given linear (including integral) operator. We introduce the space of the vector-function "<p = ('y, <p), where' u r, 'С e s, with the norm l! <FLL = /1! + \ /<P \ LC; C0 = CH> [O, 1) - about the wanderings of all fractional -radical order A on [o, 1] functions with the norm LLFLLC0 = LF (O) I + Max ID0 (f; t) o ,,; t ,,; 1 where DC> (f; t) - the derivative of the Riemann - Liuville from the fuel f (t) order about ~ a ~ 1. 82 A.F. Galimanov, since the equation under consideration, as a rule, is solved, it is desirable to develop close meters of solutions from the corresponding theoretical justification. In the work for equation (1), the method of collocation is proposed (see, for example, [2]) with a special choice of nodes. The approximate solution of equation (1) will be searched in the form of a vector-function of Chjn (t) = (' , <RP (t)), where 'yn e r and n <p11 (t) = .l .: cktk-l, ck e r, n. k = l Unknown coefficients {ck} ~ = = = I define from conditions A (FP; tj) = f (tj), j = o, n, where {tj} a is a certain system of nodlu from [o, 1]. There is a theorem.

Then the system of the negy ~ th colpentation method is monos, but • then it is permitted with the only one, but the large p and approximate solution ~ (t) are obtained by this method, converge to the IP*(t) solution of IP*(t) speed ll <p* - 1p; illc = o C:;).
