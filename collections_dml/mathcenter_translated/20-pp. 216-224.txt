The study of the spectrum of matrices obtained as a result of the central retoxy of the equation of convection -disjuisal 1 V.O. Sokolov Rostov State University, Rostov-on-Don 1 Introduction of the task of convection-disjuction are typical of mathematical models of liquid and gas mechanics. The spread of heat or impurities, for example, occurs not only due to diffusion, but also due to the movement of the medium, as a result of which convective transfer occurs. Convective-disffusive transfer plays a decisive role in modeling a wide variety of gas and hydrodynamic processes. In particular, environmental problems associated with the description of the processes of spreading impurities in the atmosphere and water bodies, with the modeling of polluted groundwater are important. The tasks of convection-diplomaticia are basic in modeling the problems of dynamics and thermal mass combination in the atmosphere and the ocean. We will consider the task of convection-disjuction in the square ω = {x | x = (x1, x2), 0 6 xα 6 1, α = 1, 2}, recorded in a symmetrical form [3]-1 pE ∆U+ 1 2 (v1 ∂u ∂x + v2 ∂u ∂y + ∂ (v1u) ∂x + ∂ (v2u) ∂y) + cu = f, x ∈ ω. (1.1) The equation (1.1) is complemented by the regional conditions of the first kind (the conditions of the conductor), which, without violating the community, can be recorded in the form of u | ∂ω = 0. (1.2) The set edge task (1.1) - (1.2) is a characteristic example inpatient task of convection-disjusion.

Using the natural order of the unknown by driving the left and right parts on PEH2, we transform (2.1) into the asymmetric five -dyagonal system of linear equations AU = b. (2.2) 218 ​​V.O. Sokolov 3 Finding the spectrum of the system of the system (2.2) We will explore the range of matrices A obtained by approximation of the problem (1.1) - (1.2), on nets with different number of nodes, with various numbers PE, with different V1 and V2 (see table. 1 ) using QR algorithm.

Since 1960 to date, QR has been a standard algorithm for calculating all points of spectrum of material matrices. Matlab, for example, to find the spectrum uses one of the four varieties of the QR algorithm implemented in it. In a freely distributed Lapack package [6], which works well on multiprocessor systems with a common memory, a QR algorithm is also implemented. In the SCALAPACK [7] package, designed to perform matrix calculations on parallel computers with distributed memory, a parallel version of the algorithm proposed by Henry in 1997 was implemented [4].

Then AI = Z T I Azi, where ZI is an orthogonal matrix, and if all its own values ​​have different modules, then the AI ​​matrices converge to the shape of Shura.
