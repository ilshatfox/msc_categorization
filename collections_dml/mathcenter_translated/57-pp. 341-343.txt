Rasulov2 1 -; NIU MAI 2 rasulov_abdu@rambler.ru; The MISI for the Bitsadze equation with many super -singular points in the younger coefficients in the present work for the Bitsadze equation, the younger coefficients of which allow strong features in many internal points that the tasks such as Hilbert have been studied. Keywords: Bitsadze equations, singular points, the operator of the century, the task of the Riman-Gilbert type. Let the area D contains many super -singular points Z0 = 0, Z = Z J ̸ = 0, J = 1, M and is limited by the simple Lyapunov contour γ, oriented counterclockwise. It is convenient to put d0 = d \ {z0, z1, z2, ..., zm} and dε = d ∩ {σm0 | z - z j | >} with small ε> 0. In the area D0, consider the bitsadze equation with the singular coefficients of the following special type: uz̄ z̄ + m∑ j = 1 a j ρ j uz̄ + a0 πm1 ρ j u = f, (1) where a j ∈ C ( G), j = 0, m and a0 = - (ab +b 2) ∏m 1 ρ j with some function b (z) ∈ C (G), analytical in the area D, where ρ j (z) is indicated for brevity for brevity = (z̄ - z̄ j) | z - z j | n j - 1, n j> 1. relative to the coefficients a j, j = 0, m, a0 and right part, it is assumed that a j (z) = a j (z j)+ρ j a0 j, a j (z j) ∈C, rea j (z j) ≤ 0, a0 j ∈ LP (D), A0, E - ∑M J = 1ω J F ∈ LP (D), P> 2, (2) where for brevity for brevity Designated ω j = 2a j (z j) (n j −1) | z - z j | n j - 1. The choice of coefficients of the specified type is explained by the fact that the three terms in the left part (2) can be represented in the form Uz̄ z̄ + m∑ j = 1 a j ρ j uz̄ + a0 πm1 ρ j u = (∂ ∂z̄ + a + b) (uz̄ - - uz̄ Bu) (3) with the coefficient A = ∑M1 A Jρ j. 342 Materials of the School-Conference by solving equation (1) is understood as the function U belonging to the Sobolevsky space W 1, P (D ∩ {σm0 | z-z j |> ε}) for any ε> 0 and satisfying the equation Uz̄ z̄ = f-( m∑ 1 a j ρ j +b) uz̄ +(m∑ 1 a j ρ j b 2) u in a generalized sense. To do this, the equations in the class U, E — ∑m j = 1ω j (uz̄ −bu) ∈Cµ (d ∩ {σm0 | z - z j |> ε}), 0 <µ <1–2/p, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u, u - ∑m j = 1ω j (uz̄ −bu) = o (1), with ε → 0. (4) a margin of type of Riman - Gilbert REG1U ∣∣ γ γ γ γ γ γ γ g1, reg2e - ∑m j = 1ω j (uz̄ –bu) is set ∣∣ γ = g2, (r) where the functions of GK, GK ∈Cν (γ), and G1 and G2 are everywhere different from zero. Let the contour γ belong to the class C 1, ν and the function ζ = α (Z) carry out the context of the form of the region D to a single circle | ζ | <1. Then, according to the Kelllog theorem, this function belongs to the class C 1, ν (D). Considering the contour γ oriented counterclockwise, we introduce the cat index k = 1 2π arggk ∣∣ γ (5) GK functions. Theorem 1. Let A = ∑m1 A Jρ j and a0 (z) = m∑ j = 1 a0 j (z), a0 j (z) = m∑ j = 1 a j (z) −a j (z j) ρ j jn) , A0 (z) ∈ LP (D). (6) Then the function T A exists, satisfies the equation (t a) z̄ = a in the area D0 and represented in the form (t A) (z) = - m∑ j = 1 ω j +h (z), (7) where h is laid. (z) = (t a0) (z)+ 1 πi m∑ j = 1 a j (z j) (n j −1) ∫ ∂d 1 | ζ- j | n j - 1 dζ ζ - z. Theorem 2. Let the condition (6) and re a j (z j) ≤ 0, j = 1, m. Then, with E — ∑m j = 1 a j (z j) ω f ∈ LP (D), any solution U equation (1) in the area D0, for which u = uz̄ −bu ∈ LP (D), (8) is given by the formula U = et bψ+ (et b te --t a - 2t b) φ+ (et b t te --t a - 2t b tetet a+ t b) f, (9) V.I. Filippov 343 Where the functions φ, ψ are analytical in the D0, moreover, E ∑m j = 1 A J (Z J) ωφ ∈ LP (D), and are determined unambiguously by U. Theorem 3. Let it be performed by the conditioneroma 1.2 and in addition to (2) the contour γ ∈ C 1, ν, and the functions of gk ∈Cν (γ), µ <ν <1. Then the task is R Fredgolmov and its index  is given by the formula  = 2 - 1 π arg (g1g2) ∣∣ γ. Boundary Value Problems for the Bitzadze Equation With Strong Singularites of Coefficvents Yu.S.
