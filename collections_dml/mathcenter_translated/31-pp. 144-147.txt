Infinitezimal automorphisms of almost the Hermite structure in the regard to the stratification of the smooth diversity of M.V. Sorokin, Penza State Pedagogical University, sorokina_m@list.ru Let ln = (m, g) - a regular generalized Lagranzha space, ∇ - truncated connectivity of the kartan of space 146 LN. Consider the metric G on TM Rimanov, which is determined as follows: g (xh, y h) = g (xv, y v) = g (x, y), g (xh, y v) = g (xv, y h) = 0, where XH, Y H, XV, Y V are horizontal and vertical elevators of vector fields from the base to tangent stratification in connectedness ∇. The distribution of horizontal liability sites ∇ determines on TM the canonical almost complex structure J: jxh = xv, jxv = −xh. Metric G is an Hermita relative to J: G (JX, JY) = G (X, Y) for any vector fields X, Y on TM, and we have almost an Hermita structure (TM, G, J). Let us consider on TM the fully given linear connectivity ∇̃, satisfying the following conditions: 1) ∇̃ agreed with the metric G; 2) ∇̃ agreed with an almost complex structure J; 3) ∇̃ retains a vertical distribution. The vector field X on TM is called the natural infinitic automorphism of almost the Hermite structure (G, J, ∇̃), if the derivative of G, J and ∇̃ along the X is zero: lxg = 0, lxj = 0, lx∇̃ = 0. On TM, automorphisms that retain layers are naturally released. In this case, as you know [1], the vector field of infinitezimal automorphism should be designed to the base. Theorem. The dimension of the algebra of natural infinitezimal automorphisms of almost the Hermite structure (G, J, ∇̃), preserving the layers of tangent stratification, does not exceed n (n + 3)/2. 147
