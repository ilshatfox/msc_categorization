The convergence of the multiple rows of Walsh in spaces close to lday, let λ = {n = (n1, n2, ..., nd)} ⊂ nd (d ≥ 1)-the family of D-dimensions. Consider the task of convergence of partial amounts of SN (f) (n ∈ λ) d-fold of furye-uolsha-palei functions F in spaces close to lux, depending on the properties of the family λ. Determine D (λ, s) = lim sup n → ¾, n∈λ Min k (v (n1) v (n2) ... v (nd) v (nk1) v (nk2) ... v (NKS) ), where Min K is taken by all S-elementary submarines k = {k1, k2, ..., ks} 159 sets {1, 2, ..., d}, v (n)-variation of the number n and the number Dim2 (Λ) = min {s: d (λ, s) < +urb} We call the binomatic dimension of the family λ. Let 1 <p <mm, α ≥ 1 and G - a binary group. Consider the space l̂p, α (GD) of all measurable finite functions F: GD → R such that 1) for each F ∈ L̂P, α (GD) there is a positive continuous strictly increasing on (0, و) function ∫ nder 1 (ip - 1 (x) xα) p dx <ing (С -1 - inverse to ∗), 2) there is constant γ> 1 such that ∫ gd γices (| f |) dµ <mm. This space is a banakh with the norm ‖f‖p̂, α = (∫ φ 1 (‖f‖ xα) p dx) 1/p. Theorem 1. Let D ≥ 1, α ≥ 1, 1 <p <mm, DIM2 (λ) = R. 1) There are C> 0, N0 ∈ N such that for any F ∈ L̂P, α (GD) ‖sn (F) ‖P̂, α+R ≤ Cr‖f‖p̂, α (n> n0 = (N0, ..., n0)). 2) for any F ∈ L̂P, α (GD) ‖sn (F) - F‖P̂, α+R → 0 (N → ∞, N ∈ λ).
