Features of the variation and increased method of solving thermal conductivity problems. R.O. Cherepanov Tomsk State University E-mail: Cro096@IC. Tsi. RU to solve thermal conductivity problems is often used by the Bio principle [1], which, in the absence of internal heat sources, is expressed by the equalue, {(L., 1 ht, 1 "it) +s (t · dr) dv +fj n; (-;. y'f, 1 ht · dt) · DA = O. V and the numerical solution of this equation can be obtained by the variage of the constituency [2], which gives the following system of equations: + 2: n; (-liff, j • + i ”· ls; = o; l:> ksk; 15 .l s l. T> s (p .q) The work considers some options for the numerical implementation of this scheme D.1 of two -dimensional setting of the problem. Literature 1. Bio M.
