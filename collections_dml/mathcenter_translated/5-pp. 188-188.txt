The decision of the regional reservation for the analytical function in the two -link area, let D - KLERO RING N PLANIS and KOMSH -OTD REPENT Z. We denote the boundary of the region D through l = l 1 u l0, and for points of lines l1, lo, respectively, LZL = Q, IZL = 1. It is required to find the function F (Z), an.tiitic and unambiguous in the area D, continuously pledsh1 the border (for the key, possibly the final number of points), according to the regional condition of the viy ((a (t) + ib (t)) f (t)] = c (t), where a (t), b (t ), C (t) - the actual functions of the accurate, continuous or: 11th gaps of the first kind in the final number of points tj, k, k = l, p, j = o, 1. At the same time, we will assume, that the desired function F (Z) may be unlimited near some of the points of TZ, K and in this case, the condition is realized a new approach to solving the task based on the direct construction of a general solution of a homogeneous problem with the analytical highlighting of the features of the coefficients. After that, a general solution to heterogeneous The task is reduced to the task of Schwartz for a circular ring with continuous marginal condenses. The picture was investigated The resolving of the problem shows the formulas of the general solution. 188
