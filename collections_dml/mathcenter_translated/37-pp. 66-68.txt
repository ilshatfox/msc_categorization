The numerical solution to the problem of the flow of the system of bodies in the variables “current function - turpect” is considered the task of streaming the system of bodies with a viscous laminated fluid flow. We describe the course of the system of equations of Navier - Stake in the variables “The function of the current ψ - vortex ω” ∂ω ∂t +· (~ v ω) = 1 re 4ω, (1) 67 vx = ∂ ∂y, vy = - ∂∂∂∂∂∂ ∂x, −4ψ = ω. (2) On each of the streamlined contours γi, the conditions of adhesion and non -treatment are recorded as ∂ ∂ ∂n = 0, ψ = ci (t). (3) In this case, the first of the conditions (3) is used to determine the boundary conditions for ω [1]. To determine the unknown constants Ci, we use the condition for the continuity of pressure on the contours [2] [p] i = ∫ γ ∂p ∂s ds = 1 re ∫ ∂ω ∂n ds = 0. (4) on each time layer task (1) - (2) was decided in the following order: 1) the definition ψ from the Poisson equation (2) with the boundary conditions of the conductor; 2) determination of the boundary values ​​ω from the solution of equation (2) with the boundary conditions of the Neumann; 3) the solution of the equation of the transfer of twisted (1). Since the value of the current function on the circuit, satisfying the condition (4), is unknown in advance, we will introduce all hydrodynamic functions as linear from CI. After the MKE-APPROXIMICATION OF Poisson, taking into account the boundary conditions of the conductor, we will come to the system of equations s ψ = f. We single out the components containing unknown CI in separate columns FI on the right side. Then, due to linearity S, it is possible to write: ψ = S -1F0 + ∑ I S -1FI ci = ψ0 + ∑ i ψi ci. Using the found ψ0, ψi, in the second step we determine the boundary values, and in the third - the fields of twist ω0, ωi, 68, which in the conditions (4), we come to the system of equations to determine the unknown constants: ∫ γi ∂ω0 ∂n ds + ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ j ∫ γi ∂ωj ∂n ds cj = 0. We use the found CI to finally determine the fields of twist and current function on the layer. As an example of the use of the described algorithm, we consider the course around three circular cylinders of different radius with the number of Reynolds relatively smaller of them Re = 200. In Fig. 1 shows the current lines at the time t = 200 and the dependence of the constant CI on time. It can be seen that the current is of a carcolor in nature. Rice. 1 l and t e r a t r a 1.
