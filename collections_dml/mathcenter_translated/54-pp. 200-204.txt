Kondrashov1 1 Alexander.kondrashov@volsu.ru; Volgograd State University is investigating the existence and uniqueness of isothermal coordinates on glued surfaces in RM. Such surfaces are a special case of non -alcohol surfaces; For them, an analogue of the famous theorem V.M. Milkova (2004). A.N. Kondrashov 201 Keywords: isothermal coordinates, glued surfaces, gluing functions. The question of the existence of isothermal coordinates on smooth surfaces is well studied, and the possibility of their introduction is extremely useful in many matters. At the same time, the question of the introduction of isothermal coordinates on non -core surfaces is very thin. Basically, conformal displays of non -burning surfaces were studied only in special cases [3] - [7]. The latest studies would seem to be a classic task of the existence of isothermal coordinates on two -dimensional surfaces in RM, only at the present stage of non -alcohol or having various kinds of pathology in the structure, was initiated in [1, 2]. Interest in isothermal coordinates on non -core surfaces is quite objective due to the prospects of practical use in computational tasks, since it is in such coordinates that in many cases it is convenient to build calculated nets. On the other hand, as noted in the preface to the monograph [2]: “It is simply amazing that in the presence of the most beautiful and richest theory of conformal display of flat regions, the corresponding theory of conformal displays of surfaces up to the present is not presented with a liaison.” Our study is aimed at developing such a theory. Let D ⊂ R2-the region and X-the two-dimensional surface in RM, (m ≥ 3), set by means of a continuous vector-function y = f (x) = (f1 (x1, x2),., FM (x1, x2 )): D → Rm, (1) implements a homeomorphic display of the region D to many F (D) with metric (and, thereby, topology!), Aviated from RM. Further, we always assume that the display F has a complete differential D F P.V. In D, and P.V. In D, Rank (d f) = 2. (2) symbols FX1 (x), fx2 (x) will designate private derivative vector-function f: fx1 (x) = (f1x1 (x),., FMX1 ( x)), fx2 (x) = (f1x2 (x),., FMX2 (x)). Using standard designations E = | fx1 | 2, f = 〈fx1, fx2〉, g = | FX2 | 2, we determine in D Metric (first quadratic shape) D S2 = E D X21 +2F D X1D X2 +GD X22 with measurable coefficients E, F, G. Determination 1. Let X-the surface set above the area D ⊂ R2 by the grade of vector-function (1) subordinate to the condition (2). Variables X1, X2 are called isothermal coordinates on the surface if E (x) = G (x), f (x) = 0 p. In D. 202, the materials of the International School-Conference in the case when X1, X2 is isothermal coordinates on the surface of X, we have D S2 = λ2 (X) (D X21 +D X22), where λ2 (x) = E (x) = G (x). We will also need the concept of W 1.2-mazhorized function. Determination 2. Let D ⊂ R2 - area. We will say that the function P: D → R is the 1.2 -is mazied in D, if there is a function k ∈W 1.2 (D) such that p (x) ≤ k (x) for P.V. x ∈ D. Determination 3. Let D ⊂ R2 - area. In the case when the function p: d → r is the 1.2 -massive d ′ bd, we say that the function p is the 1.2 loci -mastered in D. W 1.2 -marvelousness (see [1, remark §6]) means that the equality of lim ă → x p (ă) =+و can be performed on a very rare set. It can be argued, for example, that with any α> 0, its α-capacity is equal to well
