UDC 517.584 On zero combinations of works of cylindrical functions A.A. Gimaltdinova1 1 alfiragimaltDinova@mail.ru; The Ufa State Oil Technical University explores zeros of functions, which is the sum of the works of Bessel functions with opposite indices. Keywords: Bessel function, modified function of Bessel, many zeros of function. In the study of spectral tasks for degenerating equations of a mixed type (namely, when finding its own values), it becomes necessary to find zeros of the function of the species F (t) = jν (t) i --ν (t)+ iν (t) j --ν (t) , 0 <ν <1, (1) 106 Materials of the International School-Conference at re t ≥ 0. The study of zeros of combinations of works of cylindrical functions is dedicated to a relatively small number of studies. For example, the reference book [1] shows the tables of the first roots of the equation Jν (x) nν (kx) - jν (kx) nν (x) = 0 for some values ​​k and ν and the roots of the equation in (x) j ′ n (x ) - jn (x) i ′ n (x) = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2, 3. In some cases, the combinations of the works of Bessel functions are elementary functions, and then the question of their roots is solved elementary, for example, [2 , c. 91]: Jν (z) yν -1 (z) −y (z) jν -1 (z) = z πz, iν (z) I --ν+1 (z) - i -ν (z) Iν - 1 (z) = - 2sin (νπ) πz. The book [3] shows a review of works devoted to the study of zeros of functions containing works of subsitrinal functions, but function (1) or similar ones are not investigated. It is given the formula j --ν (z) iν (z) = sin (πν) πν 0f3 (1; 1– ν 2, 1+ ν 2, 1 2; - z 4 64) - - sin (πν) z 2 2π (1–ν2) 0f3 (1; 3–ν 2, 3+ν 2, 3 2; - z 4 64), (2) where 0f3 (1; a, b, c; z) - generalized hypergeometric function. Given the formula (2) function (1), you can lead to type F (t) = 2sin (πν) πν 0f3 (1; 1– ν 2, 1+ ν 2, 1 2; - t 4 64). However, in the literature known to us, there are no statements regarding its roots for the function. The theorem is fair. Equation Jν (t) i --ν (t)+ iν (t) j --ν (t) = 0, 0 <ν <1, (3) has a counting variety of positive roots t (1) k and a counting set of purely imaginary roots roots I · t (2) k with a positive imaginary part. Proof. 1) Let T = x ∈R+. Due to the fact that (∀x> 0) (Iν (x)> 0, i -ν (x)> 0), from the equation (3) we get Jν (t) iν (t) = - j --ν (t ) I --ν (t). (4) In this case, the function F1 (t) = jν (t)/iν (t) has the same zeros as the function Jν (t), and the function f2 (t) = −j --ν (t)/i- ν (t) - the same zeros as the function J --ν (t). By the theorem about the separation of the roots [4, p. 136] Due to the fact that the functions of Jν (t) and j --ν (t) are linearly independent solutions of the Bessel equation (ν - non -kissed number), zeros of the functions Jν (t) and j --ν (t) are mutually divided, therefore, And zeros functions F1 and F2 are also mutually divided. This means that between any two neighboring Yu.A. Gladyshev, V.V. Kalmanovich 107 Roots of function F1 there is exactly one root of the F2 function, and vice versa. From this, due to the continuity of both of these functions, we will get that their graphs intersect exactly at one point at each interval between any two neighboring roots of the Jerg (T) (as well as, between any two adjacent roots of the J - Haro (t)). This means that equation (4) has a counting set of positive roots. And knowing the zeros of the functions Jν (t) and j --ν (t), we can separate the intervals on which the roots of the equation are located (4). 2) Let T = I Y ∈ C, Y ERRO R+. Reasoning similarly, we get that the equation Iν (i y)/jν (i y) = −i --ν (i y)/j --ν (i y) has a counting many purely imaginary zeros. A remark. The question is not clarified whether the equation (3) has other comic roots that are different from the purely imaginary. You can make sure that the justice of the same statement for the equation Jν (t) I --ν (t)-Iν (t) j --ν (t) = 0, 0 <ν <1.
