The homogeneous regional task of Hilbert with the final number of points of the second -kind rupture for semi -throat is considered the regional task of the Hilbert of the theory of analytical functions with an endless index and the regional condition on the material axis, the coefficients of the regional condition are continuous through the gelder everywhere, except for the final number of special points TK, K = 1 , n, in which the argument of the function is coefficient G (t) = a (t) - ib (t), and A2 (t) + b2 (t) 6 = 0 everywhere on L, has ruptures of the second kind (steppe order with show Lem less one). Let d = {z: z = x+ iy, y> 0} - the upper half -plate of the integrated variable z, l is the material axis. Considering the regional task of Hilbert the theory of analytical functions with the regional condition on the material axis a (t) ℜφ (t) - b (t) ℑφ (t) = c (t), t ∈ L, t 6 = tk. Here, the coefficients of the regional condition are continuous according to the gel dera everywhere on the intervals (− least, t1), (tk, tk+1), k = 1, n - 1, (tn,+∞). 156 A. Kh. Fatykhov, the regional condition of the task of Hilbert is usually recorded in the form of re [e -iν (t) φ (t)] = c (t) | g (t) | , t ∈ L, T 6 = TJ, J = 1, N. (1) Counterbly representation ν (θ) = ν̃ (θ) + n∑ j = 1 νj (θ), νj (θ) =   ν --j | t - tj | ρj, tj, tj, tj, tj, tj −1 <tj, ν+j (t - tj) ρj, tj+1 <tj, for some numbers ν+j, ν - j, ρj, 0 <ρj <1, j = 1, n, n, n, TN = + + inous, the function ν̃ (θ) is continuous on the gelder on L, i.e. ν̃ (t) ∈ ∈ Hλ (L), with some λ and satisfies the condition. ν̃ (− least) = ν̃ (+urb). It is required to determine the function φ (Z), analytical and limited in the area D by the regional condition (1). During the solution, the formula of the general solution of a homogeneous problem (1) was found, which has the type of function φ (z) = −eiγ (z) n∏ j = 1 e i lje iαj (z - tj) ρj f (z), where αj, where αj, LJ - certain actual constant, f (z) arbitrary analytical in D function that takes purely imaginary values ​​on the material axis and satisfies a certain condition for limiting growth on the material axis. The conditions for resolving the problem have been investigated. A.A. Fernets 157 A.A. Ferenets Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Aferenets@it.kfu.ru Problems of centralized Internet networks and their solutions to the Internet of things (EV) are an environment in which unique identifiers and people are assigned to different objects (including animals and people) The possibility of transmitting data through the network without the requirement of the interaction of a man -man or a person -computer (see, for example, [1]) was provided. To create IV networks, it is necessary to solve a number of problems whose operation is: determining the rules for providing access to data (sensors) and control rights of control funds (devices), determining the rules for registering but devices on the IV network, etc. These tasks, these tasks, As a rule, they are in the local means of companies, etc., due to limited access to the created technologies, organizing an intranet instead of the Internet of things [2]. Even taking into account the unifying standards of the Consortass of the mind A-Iot [3] Modern created protocols, such as a pitch, are guided by the presence of some user management services on the network [4], the general collection and processing of possible problems in the network, excessive loads on Similar vital services. To increase the failure tolerance of IV networks, their decentralization is necessary - the transfer of computing loads to the network of devices itself (foggy calculations [5]), as well as the introduction of the protocols of the reinforcement, authentication, authorization and identification of devices based on the solutions of the Internet agents themselves
