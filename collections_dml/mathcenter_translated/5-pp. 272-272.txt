For the equation of the Eilera-ason-Darbu with a strong degeneration, we consider the equation IQ " + Q ~, 1 IQ-;:" and "= O, (!) Where n, men, in the area of ​​o, limited characteristics AB: I; = o , Sun: 17 = 1, AD: 17 = O, CD: I; = 1. Denote 0 1 = 01 \ {Q <17}; 02 = 0 11 {I;> 17}. I set 2. In the area of ​​the lnitis function and (~ .17) with the properties: 1) and (q.t}) EC (q); 2) and (~. 17) u.'vte continuous derivatives and ,, and ~, and; ,, and satisfying Equation (1) in L1 IN2; 3) there are limits from the regions n ,, i = 1.2, v, (q) = lim.17-q n ~ m [u ~ -u ~ -h (q, 17,--- n, -m; r)], o <q <i, (2) ,, _ ,. q), o <~ <1; (3) 4) satisfies the regional conditions and (o, 17) = SR (17), and {l, tj) =; s (17), here EP (17). X ( ry) -sdated functions. (4) (5) The problem is solved by the method of integral equations. Using the solution of problems of the type of cat with the specified R (17) = U (17, 17), V, (17) in <; I, I = 1 , 2, we get a two -point task relative to R <"+" '+ 11 (' 1). As a result, the theorem is proved. Problem D 2 has the only solution when fulfilling one perceptibility condition. 272
