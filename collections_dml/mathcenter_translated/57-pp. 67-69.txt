.  DOUBLY PERIODIC “JUMP” PROBLEM FOR A SECOND ORDER ELLIPTIC EQUATION  I.A. Bikchantaev  For a homogeneous second order differential equation of elliptic type with constant coefficients, a boundary value problem of finding two-periodic solutions with given jumps of them and their derivatives on the smooth and nonrectifiable closed circuit is investigated. We obtained the necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the problem and explicit formulas for its solution. Keywords: elliptic equation, boundary value problem, doubly periodic functions.  UDC 517.984.2  ON INDEPENDENCE OF EVENTS IN NONCOMMUTATIVE PROBABILITY THEORY A.M. Bikchentaev1, P.N.

Lobachevsky Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics  Let ϕ be a tracial state on a von Neumann algebra A . Projections P,Q of A are said to be independent if ϕ(PQ) = ϕ(P )ϕ(Q). First we present the general criterion of a projection pair independence. We then give a geometric criterion for independence of the following pairs of projections: 1) isoclinic; 2) one of operators is an atom of the algebra. The projection R ≡ P∨Q−P∧Q is an analog of a “symmetric difference” for a pair of projections P andQ. If R ̸= 0, I , the pairs {P,R} and {Q,R} are independent thenϕ(P ) =ϕ(Q) = 1/2 andϕ(P∧Q+P∨ Q) = 1. If, moreover, P andQ are independent, then ϕ(P ∧Q) ≤ 1/4 and ϕ(P ∨Q) ≥ 3/4. We give examples of projection pairs P and Q that are 1) isoclinic independent; 2) non-isoclinic independent; 3) non independent but with independent {P,R} and {Q,R}; 4) independent with independent {P,R} and {Q,R}. For the full matrix algebra we give several equivalent conditions for the independence of pairs of projections.  Keywords: Hilbert space, linear operator, projection, von Neumann algebra, tracial state, independence.  Let ϕ be a tracial state on a von Neumann algebra A . Projections P,Q of A are said to be independent [1], if ϕ(PQ) = ϕ(P )ϕ(Q). In [1] for this notion of independence, the structure of a finite von Neumann algebra generated by an independent family of subalgebras is determined. As a consequence, the authors obtain extensions of the Kolmogorov and Hewitt–Savage zero-one laws. For any P , the projection set {Q ∈ A : P and Q are independent} comprises a quantum logic and is closed in the strong operator topology [2, Theorem 3.1]. The strong law of large numbers for d-dimensional arrays in von Neumann algebras holds for this notion of independence [3]; for the strong laws of large numbers for positive measurable operators and applications see [4], [5] and [6].    68 МАТЕРИАЛЫ ШКОЛЫ-КОНФЕРЕНЦИИ  Here we present the general criterion of a projection pair independence. With the help of Theorem 4.8 of [7], we obtain  Theorem 1. Let ϕ be a faithful normal tracial state on a von Neumann algebraA . For P,Q ∈A pr the following conditions are equivalent:  (i) P,Q are independent; (ii) ∥I + z(PQ −ϕ(P )Q)∥1 ≥ 1 for all z ∈C; (iii) ∥I + z(PQ −ϕ(Q)P )∥1 ≥ 1 for all z ∈C. For the full matrix algebra we give several equivalent conditions for the indepen dence of pairs of projections.  Theorem 2. Consider A =Mn(C) and ϕ = 1  n tr, the normalized canonical trace. For  P,Q ∈A pr the following conditions are equivalent: (i) P,Q are independent; (ii) PQ −ϕ(P )Q is unitarily equivalent to a zero-diagonal matrix; (iii) PQ −ϕ(Q)P is unitarily equivalent to a zero-diagonal matrix; (iv) PQ −ϕ(P )Q is a commutator; (v) PQ −ϕ(Q)P is a commutator; (vi)  ∑n k=1 sk (I + z(PQ −ϕ(P )Q)) ≥ n for all z ∈C;  (vii) ∑n  k=1 sk (I + z(PQ −ϕ(Q)P )) ≥ n for all z ∈C; (viii) tr(c2)+n2 =  1  n  (n1 2  +n2 +n3 )(n1  2 +n2 +n4  ) .  Now we give a geometric criterion for the independence of the following pairs of projections: 1) isoclinic; 2) one of operator is an atom of the algebra.  Theorem 3. Let ϕ be a faithful tracial state on a von Neumann algebra A . Let P,Q ∈ A pr be isoclinic with an angle θ ∈ (0,π/2). Then the following conditions are equivalent:  (i) P,Q are independent; (ii) ϕ(P ) = cos2θ. Theorem 4. Let ϕ be a faithful tracial state on a von Neumann algebra A . Consider  P,Q ∈A pr such that P is an atom ofA . Then the following conditions are equivalent: (i) P,Q are independent; (ii) ϕ(Q) = ∥PQ∥2. The projection R ≡ P ∨Q −P ∧Q is an analog of a “symmetric difference” for the  pair of projections P and Q. We have P ∧Q⊥+P⊥∧Q ≤ P ∨Q −P ∧Q for all P,Q ∈ A pr [8, Theorem 2].  Theorem 5. Let ϕ be a faithful tracial state on a von Neumann algebraA and projections P,Q ∈A pr be independent with the projection P ∨Q−P ∧Q ̸= 0, I . Thenϕ(P ) =ϕ(Q) = 1/2, ϕ(P ∧Q +P ∨Q) = 1 and ϕ(P ∧Q) =ϕ(P⊥∧Q⊥), ϕ(P ∨Q) =ϕ(P⊥∨Q⊥).  If, moreover, P andQ are independent, then ϕ(P ∧Q) ≤ 1/4 and ϕ(P ∨Q) ≥ 3/4. We give the examples of projection pairs P and Q that are 1) isoclinic independent;  2) non-isoclinic independent; 3) non independent but with ind
