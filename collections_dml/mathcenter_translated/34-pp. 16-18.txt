The restoration of images of I. R. Akhtyamov Kazan State University when digitizing originals with partial damage (inscriptions and spots in photographs, ruptures and scratches) in the pixel array appear with distorted values ​​corresponding to the damaged area of ​​the original. Restoring the image involves the correction of given in these areas. The interpretation of the task of restoring images as a special incident of the fluid movement, obeying the Vesier -Kostok equation, served as the basis for creating a well -known recovery algorithm [1]. In this work, another algorithm for recovery of images. The idea was the process of continuing the harmonic function from the grade into the region by the Libman method [2]. The image is considered as a vector-function from two arguments, the values ​​of which are color components in the selected color model. Although with this approach, the function is specified on a discrete set of points, after about the rosepers of interpolation it can be considered as a smooth 18 function. Under the damaged section of the original, the single -link area ω with the Jordan border ∂ω is understood to mean. This approach leads to the Laplace equation for the component vector function ψP with the boundary conditions of the conductor: ∂2ψp ∂x2 + ∂2ψp ∂y2 = 0, ψp | ∂ω = ∗, where P is the color channel corresponding to the selected color model. For the resulting marginal task, the end-growth scheme is built that uses a second-order difference: ψ p i + 1, j-2ψ p i, j + ψ p i-1, j 4x2 + ψ p i, j + 1-2ψ p i, J + ψ ψ ψ ψ P I, J - 1 4Y2 = 0. (1) It is assumed that the distances between the pixels are vertical and horizontal are equal (4x = 4Y). To solve the scheme (1), the iterative method of libman is used, as a special case of the Richardson method ψ p, k+1 i, j = 1 4 [ψ p, k i+1, j+ψ p, k+1 i -1, j. + ψ p, k i, j+ 1+ ψ p, k+ 1 i, j -1], k = 0, 1, 2 ,. . . Here ψ p, k i, j is the value of the pian components of the pixel with coordinates (i, j) on k-th iteration. Developed software that implements a given algorithm.
