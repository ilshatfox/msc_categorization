) Two inequalities between the boundary moments of the inertia of the region, the main frequency and area, let ω is a single -link area with a limited area on a complex plane. Consider the boundary moments of the region I (ω) = ∫ ∫ ω DIST2 (Z, ∂ω) DA and IC (ω) = ∫ ∫ ω R2 (Z, ω) DA, (1) introduced in [1] and named, respectively, respectively , Euclidean and conformal moments of the inertia of the region relative to the border. Here, z = x + iy ∈ ω, Dist (Z, ∂ω) denotes the function of the distance from point Z to the border ∂ω region ω, r (z, ω) - conformal radius ω at point Z and DA - an element of the area. The starting points of the study are the following two results. The first of them is the inequality of the city of Polya and G. Sege [2] p (ω) λ1 (ω) a (ω) <4, (2) where P (ω) is the rigidity of the twisting ω, λ1 (ω) - the main frequency Ω (definitions see, for example, in [2]) and A (ω) - area ω. Note that inequality (2) is not optimal. Further, in the viewing article [3], examples of calculating the left part (2) for specific areas are given. It is shown, in particular, that in the type of type (2), the circle is not an extreme area. We also note an interesting and important interpretation discussed in [3] and related to the 227 -regional task {4u + αu + 1 = 0 in ω, u = 0 on ∂ω (− least <α <λ1 (ω)). Note that the use of the equation with the parameter allows you to continuously connect the three most important characteristics of the region from the inequality (2). The second starting point is F.G. Avhadiev [1] Problems of Saint-Wenan about the approximation of the stiffness of torsion by a simple geometric characteristic in the class of single-link areas. Theorem a [1]. Let ω is a single -link area of ​​the complex plane, then p (ω) < +⇒ i (ω) < +و (or IC (ω) < +∞) and a chain of inequalities I (ω) 6 IC (ω) 6 P (ω) 6 4ic (ω) 6 64i (ω). Using the theorem A, you can immediately obtain inequality similar to (2), for I (ω) and IC (ω). The main result of this work is the proof of inequalities similar (2), for boundary moments with more accurate constants. Unfortunately, these inequalities are also not optimal. Namely, the theorem will be proven. Let ω is a single -link area with a limited area, then inequalities I (∂ω) λ1 (ω) <a (ω), IC (∂ω) λ1 (ω) <2A (ω) occur. Note that these grades are integrated and do not follow from the known preferential assessments. Indeed, the following complicated grades take place (equalities are achieved only for the circle and only when the point is taken in the center of the circle): Dist2 (Z, ∂ω) 6 R2 (Z, ω) 6 J20 / λ1 (ω), where J0 = where J0 = 2.4048 ... - The first positive root of the function of the zero order. The proof of the theorem is based on the method of G. Polya and G. Sege, stated in the monograph [2] by isoperimetric inequalities, as well as on two ratios | ∇dist (z, ∂ω) | = 1, ∫ ∫ ω | ∇R (z, ω) | 2 dxdy = 2a (ω). (3) The first equality in (3) is a known property of the function of the distance, the second equality is proved in [4]. 228, let {ther} φN = 1 is a complete system of own functions in the task of oscillations of the membrane in the ω. We have 4 pipes + λn 8n = 0 in ω, onic = 0 on ∂ω; ∫ ∫ ω worK accord = 0, K 6 = L, 0 <λ1 6 λ2 6 λ3 6 .... (4) where {λn} mmn = 1 - own values ​​corresponding to the system {ther} φ n = 1. Consider a number of Fourier for the DIST (Z, ∂ω) function: ger∑ n = 1 dn accord (Z). (5) We will build in a square and intervene the first equality of (3) and then substitute (5). We get a (ω) = ∫ ∫ ω | ∇dist (z, ω) | 2 DA = ∫ ∫ ω ∑∑ dkdl (∇icle (z), ∇ accord (z)) da = ∑ ∑ dkdl ∫ ∫ ω ( ∇work (z), ∇ intern (z)) DA. Using (4) and the formula of Green, we get ∫ ∫ ω (∇icle (z), ∇ vent (z)) da = - ∫ ∫ ω ∗ 4 accord - - ∫ ∂ω ∗ ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ wor (z) ∂n DA = λL ∫ ω ω lus (z) ∗ DA, where DS is an element of the length of the border. Thus, we have a (ω) = φ∑ l = 1 d2l λl ∫ ω ω wor (z) DA. On the other hand, from (1) and (5) we display i (ω) = ∑∑ dkdl ∫ ∫ ω wor (z) ∈ (z) da = 1 d2l ∫ ∫ ω С) DA. Of the last two equations, taking into account (4) and the fact that the final number cannot be for any area of ​​its own values, the first basic result λ1 (ω) I (ω) = ω l = 1 λ1d 2 l ∫ ω ∫ ω can easily follow. wor2L (z) da <∫ ω ω و L = 1 d2l λ ∫ ∫ ω wor (z) DA = A (ω). The second basic inequality is proved similarly, while the second ratio of (3) is used.
