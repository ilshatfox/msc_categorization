) Integral medium and boundary properties of conformal display, let ω is a single -link area on a plane that does not coincide with it, F is a conformal display of a circle d = {| z | <1} on ω. In the modern theory of boundary behavior of conformal display, an important role is played by the spectrum of integral medium βf (t) = Lim Sup r → 1 log π∫ ′ | f ′ (reiaw) | TDθ log [1/1– R]. For good areas, βf (t) is a piece of line with t (for example, βf (t) = 0 at −1 ≤ t ≤ 1/3). The most non -trivial spectrum of integral average behaves when ω has a fractal border. The report will consider a new characteristic that is closely related to the spectrum of integral average βf (t). Let F - locally single -leaf and analytical in the circle d = {| z | <1} Function. Then Log F ′ is also an analytical function in a circle D and can be decomposed in a row ∑icles k = 0 akz k, uniformly converging inside D. The size β ∗ f (t) = lim sup r → 1 φ∑ k = 0 log i0 (t | ak | rk) log [1/1-r] let's call *—proner of integral medium. Here I0 (x) = ger∑ ν = 0 (x2 4) ν 1 ν! 2 is the modified function of the zero -order nub. Since the log i0 (x) ≤ x2/4, then β ∗ f (t) will be the final function from t if lim sup r → 1 φ∑ k = 0 | ak | 2r2k log [1/1– r] <mm . 36 The last ratio is performed for any function F, analytical and single -leafy in the circle D. The modified Bessel I0 function in the βF (t) study was first used by kind. It was shown that if the log f ′ (z) = a ∑ zq k, then βf (t) ≥ log i0 (AT)/ log Q. The relationship of the characteristics βf (t) and β ∗ f (t) will be shown. We will prove that β ∗ f (t) (like βf (t)) is a continuous convex function from t. Further, it will be shown that the spectrum βf (t) can be obtained from β ∗ f (t) by “turning” of the Log F ′ (Z) coefficients. It will also be proved that if the Taylor coefficients AK Log F ′ (Z) are positive, then βf (t) ≥ β ∗ f (t). With the help of these results, lower estimates of the spectrum of integral medium βf (t) will be obtained.
