Double scaling splashes S.A. Chumachenko1 1 chumachenkosergei@gmail.com; The Saratov National Research State University considers a new class of basic scales, which are multiple integrating Walsha's function. It is proven that these sets are a solution to the scalable equation. The obvious type of this scalating equation is indicated. Keywords: binary basic splashes, a scaling equation. Let I f (x) = x 0 f (t) d t (x ∈ [0.1]) - the integration operator, W2N -1 (x) - the functions of the WALSH. Determination 1. Function ement (x) = (4i) nw2n-1 (2-n x) (x ∈ [0.2n]) will be called binary basic splash of the nth degree. In [1] it was proved that the compression and shift system, built on the basis of the function eed (x), is the basis in space C0 [0.1] and is fairly inequality | f (x) —s2n+ j (x) | = ω f (1 2n+2)+ω2f (1 2n+2). where S2N+ J (x) is the value of partial amounts at point X, ω F, ω2F - the continuity of the first and second order. The theorem about the scaling equation. The following equality is true: wor (x) = 1 2m wor (2x −0)+ 2m - 1∑ t = 1 1 2m -1 wor (2x - t)+ 1 2m wor (2x −2m) The work is performed with financial support of the Russian Federation (project 16-01-00152).
