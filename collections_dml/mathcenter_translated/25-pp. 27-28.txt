The solution of the solution of the singular integral equation is considered the singular integral equation of the i -th genus /_11 x (t) dt (t) jl = "t2 = y (t), -1 <t <1; /_11 x (t) dt = 0 v11 = -t2, (1) where y (t) e (-1, 1) is the known, and x (t)-the desired functions with responsibly. 27 on the segment (-1, 1] are introduced systems of nodes 2k tk = -1+-, k = o, n; n-2j -1 t1 = -1+-, j = 1, n, n, n and approximate solution of equation (1) is searched in the form of zero degree n xn (t) = l cktpk (t), n, k = l where cpk (t) = {1 at t e (tk-1, tk] i o for t ~ (tk-1, tk] }. Unknown coefficients ck = xn (tk) e jr. Determined from the system of linear algebraic equations N l: b1kck = yj, j = 1, p, (2) k = l of theorem. For all N 2: N 0 e n The system (2) has a one-up-up ssteop.
