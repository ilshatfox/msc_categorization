) The solution of the singular integral equation with comprehensive -consolidated unknown descent methods. We consider the singular integral equation A (t) onic (t) + b (t) onic (t) + c (t) s (t) + d (t) s ur (t) ) = f1 (t), (1) where siron (t) = 1 πi γ γ onic (τ) τ τ τ τ τ τ, γ is the circle of a single radius with the center at the beginning of the coordinates. 117 To the equation (1) add the equation comprehensive to it a (t) onic (t) + b (t) onic (t) + c (t) s] (t) + d (t) s accord (t) = f1 (t). (2) We denote, as in [1], x1 (t) = onic (t), x2 (t) = onic (t). Then equations (1) and (2) can be considered as a system of singular integral equations kx (t) ≡ a (t) x (t) + b (t) sx (t) + thx (t) = f (t), where x (t)-vector-function with components x1 (t), x2 (t); f (t) - vector (f1 (t), f1 (t)); a (t), b (t) - dimensional matrices 2; ThX (t) is a completely continuous part, the exact appearance of which is brought to [1]. It is shown that, taking into account the specifics of the vector X (t), the operator K is symmetrical, and the AX (t) ≡a (t) x (t) operator for re a≥ 0 and (re) 2 ≥ | b (t) | 2 is [2] monotonous in mihlin [3]. Denote γ = min (re, (re a) 2 - | b | 2). If γ> ‖c‖ + ‖d‖, where the norm is taken in C (γ), then the operator K is also monotonous and the solution of the equation (1) onic (t) = (x ∗ 1 (t) + x ∗ 2 (t ))/2 is the method of the most important descent by minimizing the functionality f (x) = (kx, x) - 2re (f, x). The rate of convergence of the method is estimated [4] depending on the difference M −m ≤ ‖ γ ‖ ‖c‖ +‖d‖, where m (m) is the largest (smallest) own value of the operator K. In the case of arbitrary coefficients of the equation ( 1) As a minimized functionality, you can take φ (x) = ‖ax1 + bx2 + csx1 - dsx2 + Th1x2 - F1‖. In the latter case, a convergence assessment can be obtained from the general convergence of the method of the smallest squares [3]. L and T R A 1.

Kazantsev (Kazan) Flea derivatives with Blokhov Pre -Vartsanians The main strategy for the study of many holomorphic and local single -leafy in the circle E = {| ζ | <1} Functions F with the only extremum of the flea derivative (1 - | ζ | 2) | F ′ (ζ) | It is to study the properties of diving A in various functional classes. The properties of three of these dives are discussed: 1) display that compares the function F of its Schwartz derivative sf = f ′ - f 2/2, where f = f ′ ′/f ′ - pre -jets, 2) identical immersion a into the space of the holomorphic functions with an uniform topology convergence on compacts, and 3) immersion F 7 → F into the space of the flea with the prenature | f | b = submar (1 - | ζ | 2) | f ′ (ζ) |. In particular, the theorem is fair. If the holomorphic in E function F satisfies the condition | F ′ ′/F ′ | b = 2, then f ∈ A. The set A (identified with its image when immersed in b) is absorbing, but is neither balanced (even in the case of F (0) = 0), nor star -shaped. However, when limited to subspace b̃ = {f ∈ B: f (0) = 0}, the set ã = a ∩ b̃ acquires starship (the justification of which develops the technique of parametric families from [1]), which allows us to describe ã0 and ã - in terms of the functionality of Mingkovsky ρ for A; So, ã0 = {bf: f ∈ S1 and b <b̃ (f)}, 119
