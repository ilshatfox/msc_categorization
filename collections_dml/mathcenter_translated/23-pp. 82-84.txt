) The study of the stochastic line-quadratic task of the optimal control, let (ω, f, p, {ft} tsidear)-a complete probabilistic space with filtration, which determines such independent centered Poisson measure ν and standard one-dimensional Browned movement W, which {ft } T≥0 is a natural filtration generated by W and ν, replenished with all p -mile elements from f. Consider the linear controlled stochastic differential equation dx (t) = [a (t) x (t) + b (t) u (t)] dt + [c (t) x (t) + d (t) u (t) ] DW (t) + + ∫ rd [k1 (t, θ) x (t) + k2 (t, θ) u (t)] ν (dt, dθ), x (τ) = uty, t ∈ [τ , T], (1) where τ ∈ (ft) tgr [0, t], that is, to many points of stopping with values ​​in [0, t], ∈ Fτ belongs to the many measurable n - sinter random vectors from The final second moments; ∫ || k1 (t, θ) || 2m (dθ), ∫ || k2 (t, θ) || m (dθ) are (ft) th favor. A, b, c, d - coordinated limited matrices. The control process u (·) ∈ U [τ, t] = l2f (τ, t; rm), that is, the set (ft) tsideum of the M-success with the final 84 second moments determined in an accidental interval [ τ, t]. With these assumptions, the equation (1) has the only strong solution X (·) ∈ L2F (τ, t, RN). We determine the functional cost as follows: j (τ, perf; u) = e {∫ rd [x ∗ (t) q (t) x (t) + u ∗ (t) ru (t)] dt + x ∗ (t ) Gx (t) ∣∣fτ}, where Q (·), r (·) are {ft} tsidear - mlassed limited symmetric matrix, G is a symmetric ft -measured limited matrix. One of the main results is the theorem. The linear-quadratic task is partially solved by (τ, perf) ∆ [0, t] with a partially optimal pair (x (·), u (·)) then and only when the next direct reverse stochastic differential equation: dx ( t) = [AX (t) + Bu (t)] dt + [cx (t) + du (t)] dw (t) + + ∫ rd [k1 (t, θ) x (t) + k2 (t θ) u (t)] ν (dt, dθ), dp (t) = - [at (t) + ct q (t) + ∫ rd kt1 x (t) m (dθ) + qx (t) ] dt + q (t) dω (t) + ∫ rd q1 (t, θ) ν (dt, dθ), x (τ) = ă, p (t) = gx (t), allows such a solution (x (·), P (·), q (·), q1 (·, ·)), that Iω (τ, lection) [Ru (·) + Bt P (·) + Dt Q (·)] = 0. If ω (τ, lection) = ω and r (·) −1 ∈ Linger (0, T; SM), then optimal control u (t) = −r (t) −1 [b (t) t p (t) + c (t) t q (t)], t ∈ [τ, t]. L and T R A 85 1. CHEN S., Yong J. Stochastic Linear Quadratic Optimal Control Problems. // Applied Mathematics Optimization. - 2001. - P. 21–45. L. V. Veselova (Kazan), O.E. Tikhonov (Kazan, Oleg.tikhonov@ksu.ru) about the automatic continuity of positive operators as well known, positive linear display in ordered banana spaces with some additional assumptions are automatically continuous. Apparently, the strongest result in this direction belongs to G. Ya. Lozanovsky (see [1, chap. 6, §2], [2, theorem 1.2.1], [3, consequence 6]). The purpose of this message is to summarize the result of Lozanovsky, in particular, in the event of metriezed topological vector spaces. Recall that the wedge is the subset of the material vector space, satisfying the conditions k +k ⊂ k, λk ⊂ k (λ ∈ R +). The wedge k is called a cone if k ∩ −k = {0}. Let X-F-space with invariant metric ρ and | x | ≡ ρ (x, 0) (x ∈ X) (see [4, II.1]). We will say that the wedge k in x has an assembly, if the convergence of the numerical series is ∑ | xn | (xn ∈ K) entails convergence in the X series ∑ xn to an element from K. Theorem. Let X1 and X2-two F-space with wedges K1 and K2, and the wedge K1 gives rise to X1 (i.e., x1 = k1–k1) and has assembly, and K2-a closed cone. Then any linear operator from X1 to X2, translating K1 to K2, is continuous. Consequence. Let the X1 and X2 be two full metrhysable topological vector spaces with closed cones of positive elements K1 and K2, and K1 gives rise to X1. Then any linear positive operator from X1 to X2 is continuous. The work was supported by the program “Universities of Russia - Fundamental Research” (project UR 04.01.011). 86
