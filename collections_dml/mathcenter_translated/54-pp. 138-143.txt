Materials of the International School-Conference in the report discussed some close issues. Examples of finding the rank of specific tensors are given, in particular, for elements of tensor spaces involved in the constructions of standard complexes of homological theory (see, e.g., [2]). At the same time, we use the results of articles [3] - [5]. One example considers the standard projective resolver for the banacha algebra of Berling, consisting of summarized sequences, with a spur as a multiplication. Moreover, it is considered as a module over itself with a natural left -handed effect. Literature 1. Grothendieck A. Produits Tensorielles Topologiques et espaces nuclearies. // Mem. Amer. Math.

UDC 517.95 On the stability of solving the dezin problem for the equation of Lavrentiev - Bitsadze V.A. Gushchina1 1 violetta.novikova.1991@mail.ru; The Samara State Social and Pedagogical University in this work for the Lavrentiev-Bitsadze equation is considered a non-channel dezin task in a rectangular area. The solution to the problem is built in the form of a number of a number of own functions of the corresponding one -dimensional spectral problem. Under certain conditions, relative to the parameters and specified functions, the convergence of the constructed row in the regular decisions class has been proved and the stability of the solution from the specified boundary functions has been established. Key words: Dezin’s unfobedile task, Lavrentiev-Bitsadze equation, V.A. Gushchina 139 Unity, existence, row, small denominators, convergence, stability. Consider the Lavrentiev-Bitsadze equation lu ≡ uxx + (sgny) uy y = 0 (1) in the rectangular region d = {(x, y) | 0 <x <l, −α <y <β}, where l> 0, where L> 0, where l> 0, α> 0, β> 0 - set valid numbers, and set the following non -cabinal task. Dezin's task. Find the function u (x, y) that meets the conditions: u (x, y) ∈C 1 (D) ∩c 2 (d - ∪d+); (2) lu ≡ 0, (x, y) ∈ D - ∪d+; (3) u (0, y) = u (l, y), ux (0, y) −ux (l, y) = 0, −α≤ y ≤β; (4) u (x, β) = onic (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ l; (5) uy (x, −α) −λu (x, 0) = ψ (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ l, (6) where scrates (x), ψ (x) - specified rather smooth functions, λ - specified Actual parameter. A.A. Diszin [1] noted that the method of searching for permitted extensions for differential operators can be adapted to the operator Lavrentievabitsadze with the conditions of frequency of the variable X. BEHIND. Nakhusheva [2] The task (2) - (6) is studied when α = l, onic (x) = ψ (x) = 0, f (x, y) = f (x, y) · h (y), H (y) - the function of the Hevisayd, λhernzeas 0. It is shown that with λ <0 a homogeneous task (i.e., when f (x, y) ≡ 0) has non -trivial solutions. In the works [3, 4], the solution of this problem is built in the form of the sum of a row U (x, y) = 1 p l u0 (y) +√ 2 l +φ∑ n = 1 un (y) cosµn x +υn (y) sinµn x, (7) where the coefficients UN (y), u0 (y), and υn (y) are determined according to the formulas: un (y) =  ϕ onic an (α, y) ∆ (n ) –Ψn shµn (β - y) ∆ (n), y> 0, onic Bn (α, y) ∆ (n) +ψn cn (y, β) ∆ (n), y <0, provided that With all n ∈N ∆ (n) = cosµnαch icket-shµnsysinα + λ λ µn shyachµnβ ̸ = 0, where 140 materials of the international school-conference AN (α, y) = cosµnαchµn y-sinµn λ µn shchµn y, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn (α, bn, bn y) = cosµn (α+ y)+ λ µn sinµn y, cn (y, β) = chµnoxin y - shµncosµn y. u0 (y) = onic 1+λ, 1+λβ+ψ0 y –β 1+λβ, −α≤ y ≤β, 1+λβ ̸ = 0, ∗0 = 1p l l l wor (x) d x, ψ0 = 1p l l lˆ 0 ψ (x) d x υn (y) =  ̃ ∗n an (α, y) ∆ (n) - ̃n shµn (β - y) ∆ (n), y> 0, ∗n BN (α, y) ∆ (n) + ̃n cn (y, β) ∆ (n), y <0, ∗n = √ 2 l ĺ 0 onic (x) sinµn xd x, ̃̃n = √ 2 l ĺ 0 ψ (x) sinµn xd x, and theorems of the existence and uniqueness of the task (2) - (6) are proved. In this work, we establish the stability of the solution of this problem relative to the boundary functions ng (x), ψ (x). To do this, we give auxiliary statements from [3, 4]. Lemma 1. If α̃ = α/L is a natural number and λ> −2π/l, then there is a positive constantC0, depending on λ and l, such that with all n ∈N the valuation | ∆ (n) | ≥ Eµnβc0> 0. Lemma 2.
