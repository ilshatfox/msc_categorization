. Building a dual basis from the minimum cycles of A.V. Laptev Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, A.Lapteva@ntek.nnov.ru Consider the triangulated closed n-dimensional multiplot p, groups of its syplucial chains CI (P), CEC CLOSE (P) and HIMOLOGY HI (P) with fields from the field Z2, I = 0, 1,. . . , n. Let it: hk (p) × hn --k (p) → z2 - intersection index. Definition. Bases [xk1] ,. . . , [x k r] Gomology group HK (p) and [z n -k 1] ,. . . , [z n -k r] Homologies group HN -K (p), k ∈ {0 ,. . . , n}, are called dual if ind ([xki], [z n --k j]) = {1 for i = j, 0 in all other cases. Consider the non -negative weight function L: C1 (p) → R. The method of solving the following problem is proposed. Let [zn -11] ,. . . , [z n - 1 r] - the basis of the HMMology group HN -1 (P). It is necessary to find one -dimensional cycles X11 ,. . . , x 1 r, homologous classes of which form the basis of the group H1 (P), the dual base [zn -11] ,. . . , [z n - 1 r], while for all k = 1 ,. . . , R X1k cycle has the minimum weight of L (x 1 k) in its homologation class. 151 The general scheme of solving the problem is as follows. The index vector-function relates relative to the basis [ZN-1] is launched ,. . . , [z n - 1 r], that is, such homomorphism j: c1 (p) → zr2, which is for the arbitrary cycle y ∈ Z1 (p) and numbers i ∈ {1 ,. . . , r} coordinate J I (y) of the vector j (y) ∈ ZR2 coincides with the cycles of the cycles y and zn -1k. The method for constructing an index vector of a function has developed in [1]. Building the cycle x1k, k = 1,. . . , r, is carried out by the next way. Through each vertex v ∈ V (ZN -1 K), a cycle xV ∈ Z1 (P), which has an J (XV) = EK and smallest weight L (XV) among all cycles that have their similar ones, is built; Here EK is a single vector of space ZR2, the K-I coordinate of which is 1. Construction of the XV cycle is described in [2]. Then from the set Z (ZN -1K) = {XV | V ∈ V (Z N -1 K)} is selected by the X1K cycle, for which l (x1k) = min Xear (z n -1 k) l (x ′).
