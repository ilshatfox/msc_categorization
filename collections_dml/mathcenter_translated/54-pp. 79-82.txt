Presentation of the sum of the recurrent formula for determining the indicators of the backfall of Lambert in the form of decomposition to simpler amounts of A.P. Bulanov1 1 bksen2002@yandex.ru; NIYAU MEPHIE Upninsky Institute of Niyau MEPHI discusses the recurrent formula for determining the indicators of the reverse chain exhibit, which was previously obtained as a generalization of the concept of the initial function of Lambert. One of the ways to calculate the reverse indicator an is given by decomposing the starting amount for partial amounts, the procedure for the summation of which is strictly less than N. As an example, this method is calculated the reverse indicator A6. Keywords: chain exhibits, indicator of chain exhibitors, mutually reverse chain exhibitors, summation for all non -equal combinations, summary procedure, sequence of indicators, lumber hyperfunction. Consider two chain exhibitors LB (Z) = Z · B (Z), (1) LA (W) = W · A (W). (2) The chain exhibit (1) is determined by the sequence of functions: b (z) = eb1z · b1 (z), b1 (z) = eb2z · b2 (z) ,. . . , Bk -1 (z) = ebk z · bk (z). Here is the designation b (z) = <e z; b1, b2, ...>. Similarly, the exhibit is determined (2), where a (w) = <eW; A1, A2, ...> Let the sequence of indicators {BN} inous = 1 satisfies the condition BN ̸ = 0, = 1.2, .., lim | BN | = b <و then the limit function b (z) = lim k -> urb <ez; b1, b2, ..., bk, 0.0, ...> converges in the circle k = {z: | z | <1 eb} (see [1] and [2]). Chain Exonients (1) and (2) can be mutually reverse functions, then the sequence of indicators {an} φN = 1 is determined by the recurrent formula (5) below (see also [3], p. 69). The initial function of Lambert w = z · 〈ez; −b, −b, ...,〉 (3) is defined as the reverse function in relation to the elementary function Z = w · ebw = w · 〈ew; b, 0.0, ...〉. (4) from the definition (3) we see B1 = B2; Then, including the inequality of b1 ̸ = b2, we when we generalize the concept of the initial function of Lambert (3). Instead of the initial function (4), you can consider the final chain exponent Z = w · 〈ew; b1, ..., be, 0.0, ...〉, where bk ̸ = 0, k = 1.2, ... , l, or infinite z = w · 〈ew; b1, b2, ...〉. 80 Materials of the International School-Conference This General is an intermediate between the initial function of Lambert (3) and Lambert ′S HW Function, which was introduced by I.N. Galidakis in 2004 Lambert HW functions are used in solving some functional equations that arise, in particular, in gravitational mechanics (see [4]- [6]). Here the task is to ensure that according to a given function w = lb (z) = z · b (z), find the function of it reverse z = la (w) = w · a (w), analytical in the vicinity of t. W = 0 (or vice versa, according to a given function z = la (w), find the function of W = LB (Z)), that is, according to the specified indicators B1, B2, ..., find indicators A1, A2, ... the first are easily determined Three indicators: a1 = −b1, a2 = b2 −b1, a3 = 1 b2 · · (b21 −2b1b2 +b2b3). Indicators A4, A5 ,. . . , AN are determined by the mentioned recurrent formula AN = −1 A1A2 ... an -1 · {∑ k1+k2+...+KN - 1 = N KK21 K3 2 ... k n - 1 n -2 k1! K2! ...

BN -11BN}, (5) where the summation is carried out for all non -regional combinations of non -negative integers K1, K2, ..., KN -1, satisfying the equation K1+K2+...+KN -1 = n. We denote the amount in the formula (5) through SN. The amount in equality (5) contains n = 2n -1 terms, which are denoted through då, 1 ≤ ≤ n: each non -zero combination corresponds to the term. Then we have SN = N∑ å = 1 DX. (6) We agree to say that SN has a “summation procedure N”. In [7], the theorem has been proven (see p. 108–110): If LB (Z) = Z · 〈EZ; α, B, B, ...〉, (7) where α ̸ = B and the function LA (w) = w · 〈ew; A1, A2, ...〉 is reverse in relation to the function (7), then the indicators A1 = −α, A2 = A3 = A4 = ... = AN = ... = B −α. (8) From the analysis of the chain exhibit (7) and the resulting sequence (8), the question arises: what will be the reverse of the exhibit LA (W) = W · 〈EW; , A1, A2, ...〉, if the initial exhibit of LB (Z) = Z · 〈EZ; B, α, B, B, ...〉? (9) A.P. Bulanov 81 In this message we will give one of the ways to calculate the indicators an by decomposing the initial amount of SN, which has the procedure for summing n, for partial amounts, the procedure for the summation of which is strictly less than N. Imagine the amount of SN in the form of SN = S (N) N +SN -1N +... +S (N - L) N +... +S (2) n +S (1) n, (10) where S where (n) n = sn (k1 = n) = d1; s (n - l) n = sn (k1 = n - l) = 2l∑ å = 2l - 1+1 då, (11) l = 1.2 , ..., n −2, n −1, (moreover DN = B1 · B2 · ... · BN -1 · BN). From such an idea it is clear that each term of SN, corresponding to a certain non -equal combination that satisfies the equation K1 + ... + KN -1 = N, is contained in total (6). On the other hand, this term is contained in one of the partial amounts of decomposition (10), and by number å it is possible to determine the corresponding non -lobe combination. This scheme for calculating the amounts is used to calculate some specific indicators of the reverse chain exSOs
