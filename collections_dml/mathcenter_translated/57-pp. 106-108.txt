Lobachevsky new inequalities for the stiffness of twisting, summarizing the classical results of G. Polya, G. Segeo, E. Makai, are developed in articles [1], [2], one of the authors of this work. In this article, using approaches from [1], we complement the ratings for the stiffness of twisting through the Euclidean moments of the region of various orders. Key words: wiping stiffness, moment of inertia of the area relative to the border, the function of the distance to the boundary of the region, isperimetric inequalities, a convex region. L.I. Gafiyatullina, R.G. Salakhudinov 107 Let G - a single -link area on the plane, a (G) - area of ​​the region G. Determination 1. Physical functionality p (G): = 2 ï g u (x, g) DA, is called the rigidity of the area G, where u ( X, G) - the solution of the Poisson equation △ U = −2 with the boundary condition U = 0 [3]. Determination 2. Geometric functionality IP (G): = ï g ρ (x, g) DA, where ρ (x, g) is the function of distance from point X to the boundary of the region G, is called the Euclidean moment of the region relative to the boundary of the order p. With p = 2, this functionality is called Euclidean Moentia inertia of the region (see [4]). In 1995, F.G. Avhadiev received bilateral grades for the stiffness of torsion in the class of single -link areas i2 (G) ≤ P (G) ≤ 64i2 (G). (1) Thus, the rigidity of the power is prudent to the Euclidean moment of the inertia of the region. In the classroom of convex areas, the circle of equivalent functionals is very wide, among them there are simple. In the case when G is a convex region, in 1951 G. Polya and G. Segeo [3] showed that the following inequality p (G) ≥ 1 2 A (G) ρ (G) 2 takes place. (2) Here ρ (G) - the radius of the maximum circle contained in G. Equality B (2) is achieved for the circle. In 1962, E. Makai [5], received an assessment from above, namely: p (G) ≤ 4 3 A (G) ρ (G) 2, (3) fair for convex areas. Equality B (3) is achieved in the limit for degenerated areas, in particular, for a narrow rectangle. We denote the perimeter of the curve through L (t), which consists of those points from G, for which the minimum distance to the border G is t. Let l (ρ (g)): = limt → ρ (g) l (t). The following theorems for the stiffness of torsion develop inequalities (1), (2) and (3). Theorem 1. Letg - convex area on the plane, 2> q> 0, p> q, then p (g) ≤ 4 3 (q +2) ((p +1) (p +2) IP (G) ρ ( G) P -2 + (p −q) l (ρ (g) ρ (g) 3) - 2π (2–q) (ρ (G) 4) 3 (Q +2), moreover, constant 4 (p +1) (P +2)/3 (Q +2), corresponding to the first terms, is accurate. 108 Materials of the School-Conference of Theorem 2. Let the convex area on the plane, q> 0, q ≥ p ≥ 0, then p (G) ≥ 1 2 (q +2) ((p +1) (p +2) IP IP (G) ρ (g) p - 2 + (p −q) l (ρ (g) ρ (g) 3) + πqρ (g) 4 2 (q +2), with constant (p + 1) ( P + 2)/2 (Q + 2), corresponding to the first terms, is accurate.
