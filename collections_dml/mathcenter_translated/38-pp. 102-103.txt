Continuation of the matrix algebrus and indefinite homogeneous hyperpers in C3 will consider in the space of C3 a rigid affino-one native material hyperput with an unpertured form of Levy. The narrowing of the complex tango space to the algebra h of the linear vector fields on AF is some prayer of the material matrix subpalgram G C M (2, C) (in such a situation we call h the continuation of the algebra G). It is known [1] that for the unsteadily strict pseudo, a convex homogeneous hyperpan of the general position of Al Hebra G is like a 3-dimensional algebra or 4-dimensional algebra)} Theorem. Highly hard affino -monorrodic on top of Nosta m <with 3 set by equation IMZ = /Z1 /2 - LZ21 2 + Q (Z1, Z2) + Q (Z1, Z2) + L FK (Z, Z), (1) K ~ Z M. S. Dan Ilov 103 where Q (Z1, Z2) is a square form. If you make a view of the algebri h line ~ x vector ~ x fields per m)} = 3, then algebra 9 is similar to 91. The quadratic form Q (Z1, Z2) from equation (1) can be given [2] to one of the 3 special types, each of which depends on only two material parameters. In all 3 cases, continuations of algebra 91 were built and the corresponding double-parametric families of affino-a-naval indephinite surfaces were obtained. Literature 1. Loboda A.V.
