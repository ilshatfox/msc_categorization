The Galerkin method for a regulatory syllabular integro-reduced equation in [1] is proposed a method for an approximate solution of Singeal. Lyarni integro-radical equation: '() \ 11 x (t) dt () xt+l --- = 9t, -1 t-t 1t1 <1, (1) with conditions x (-1) = x (l ) = About. (2) The method is based on the circulation of the singular integral in equation (1) and the application of the Galerkin method to the obtained regulated equation. Numerical examples are given, but there is no study of the resolution of the problem (1), (2) and assessments of the convergence of the method of the method. This gap is replenished with the following results. We introduce weight spaces x = {x e i'i, p 1 x (-t) = x (t), t e [-1, 1], x (-1) = x (l) = o}, z = {g e l2, p j g (-t) = -g (t), t e [-1, 1]}, p (t) = (1 -t 2) 112, 290 a. I.
