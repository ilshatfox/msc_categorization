The differential equation for a function displaying a single circle to a curved polygon of a special type. This work continues the research that began in [1]. We fix the numbers α, β ∈ R. Let the single -legged region B of the extended complex plane W satisfy the condition of the condition: 1) 0 6 organs B, φ ∈ B, 2) ∂B = ∪NK = 1LK, i.e., the boundary of the region B consists of the final number of arcs of LK, each of which, when choosing a regular branch of transformation ă = wα+iβ, passes into an arc of a circle with a center at a point cil = 0 or a radial ray of a plane hole, 3) each point AK, 1 6 K 6 N, is the top of the curvoline n -angle b -is The achieved boundary point of the region B (if several angular points are located at some point of the plane W, then the same will be the top). If the above conditions 1) –3 are performed for the single -link area B of the expanded compel plane W), then area B is called the area that satisfies the condition [α, β] 1 ∗. They say that the function F obeys the condition [α, β] 1 ∗ if it satisfies the following conditions: 1) f (z) is regular in the punctured circle e ∗ = {0 <| z | <1} And has a simple pole at the beginning of the coordinates, S. R. Mironov, L. D. Pogodin 97 2) F (Z) one -leaf displays the punctured circle E ∗ on the lastrate B, satisfying the condition [α, β] 1 ∗. Theorem. If the function F subordinates the condition [α, β] 1 ∗, then it satisfies the usual differential equation of the type {f, z} = - 1 2 (α - 1 + iβ) (α - 3 + iβ) (F ′ (Z) F (z)) 2 + p (z), where p (z) = n∑ k = 1 (1 - α2k 2 (z - αk) 2 + ck z - ak). Here CK is some complex constants, αkπ - inside the angles in the vertices of AK region b = f (e ∗), {f, z} - about the egmarly suture of the function f. L and T R A T U R A 1.
