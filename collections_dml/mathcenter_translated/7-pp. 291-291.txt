Construction of the KRILE profile with the stock Putj !: M modification of the well -known distribution of speed O.A. Vol. NG. Chebotarev Kazan State University 420008, Kazan, ul. University, 17 At first, a direct task was to be solved by the flow of the plane-paralle with a liabeted flood of the ideal incompressible fluid of a flat plate with a runoff located on it in the assumption of the hypothesis of Zhukovsky-Chaplygin. The analytical solution of the task was obtained, numerical calculations have been made, the current lines were built in the physical plane of the flow, the effect of the location of the drain on the aerodi namic characteristics was studied, and the distribution of speed on the surface of the plate was found. Then this distribution was modified, namely, the infinite value of speed is replaced by the final one. Having set this new speed distribution as the original, the reverse task of building a profile with a normal suction was solved. As an auxiliary function, the function used by G.G. Tumashev (!) Was taken. According to the resulting analytical decision, numerical calculations were carried out and the wing of the howl of the profile was built. To fulfill the conditions of resolving, which arise in the reverse edge of the Wage of the Aerohydrodynamics Problem, the quasi of quasi (2) was used. For the constructed Krylovoro profile, an aerodynamic characteristics are calculated. Literature 1. Tumashev G.G., Nuzhin M.T.
