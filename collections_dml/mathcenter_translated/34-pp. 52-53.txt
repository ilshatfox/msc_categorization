. Small Abelian groups regarding various classes of the Abel groups I.V. Gerdt Tomsk State University Let K is a certain class of abele groups. We will call Abelev a small relatively k, or k-mala, if for any family of groups {bi} i organ, where bi ∈ K for any i ∈ I is performed by Hom (a, ⊕ i organ bi) ∼ = ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ ⊕ I∈I Hom (a, bi). If class K coincides with the class of all abele groups, then the K-small group A will be called small. In [1], the properties of the K-small groups were studied and a complete description of small and D-small aboles groups was obtained, where D is the class of all divided aboles groups. Theorem 1. The following conditions for the Abel group A are equivalent: 1) A-D-small group; 2) a - of course the generated group; 3) a - a small group. Let < - the class of all reduced abele groups. The following result was obtained. 54 Theorem 2. For the Abel group A, the following conditions are equivalent: 1) a-<-Ala group; 2) if M is the epimorphic image of the group A and M - the direct sum of the cyclic groups of the final order, then M is the limited group; 3) if M is the epimorphic image of the group A and M - the period of the wild group, then M is the straight amount of the divided and limited groups; 4) for any groups BI (i ∈ I) are such that b1i = 0, and any homomorphism ffic: a → ⊕ i et Bi there is a final beam J ⊂ i such that wor (a) ⊂ ⊕ iorn bi . For the case when the group of the group without torsion is a limited group, such results were obtained about K small groups. Theorem 3. Let K - a certain class of abele groups without twisting. Let G - a group without twisting and a - a group of group G, such that G/A is a limited group. Then G is a K-Mala Group and only when a is a K-Malaya group. Consequence. Each subgroup of the final index of the K-Mala group without twisting an endless rank is K-Mala. L and T R A T R A 1. Gerdt I.V.
