. Lastin under the pressure of a hard flat stamp S.A. Malkin Kazan State University in the work solves the task of finding a deformed consult of the plate curved under the pressure of the stamp glued to it. The contjection stresses of the interaction of the stamp and plain are determined. The solution is carried out .. 'lus is not a direct method of boundary elements. The permitting system of integrated equations for a given task is given in [L). But unlike '[l) it is expected that the stamp has an arbitrary outline. Therefore, when you number the integrals in the area of ​​contact for the sampling of the given area, tre. "I ~~~ · · ~ je;-· · ·---._._- ~ · ~ · 1 1 · ~ ~ z! J! :. (\ '., \., \ (ff · / 1, "; ~ \'!

For example, the task of turning a round stamp with a diameter of 0.3 m is solved, and the leno in the center of the plate (1 mx 1 m), at an angle of 4 ° in the direction of the axis of x. Figure 1 shows the distribution of contact stresses. The dashed line shows the level of zero voltages. 99 Literature 1. Artyukhin Yul "Malkin S.A.

Anode form -shaped When cutting with an asymmetric trihedral cathode K.Sh. MA1SHUR Kazan State University by hydrodynamic an.Ru1 · OM finding the anode border from the messenger characteristics of the tool (the width is equal to the side of the side faces - p and y) is the task of determining the border by the current AB (Fig. 1) with the specified year FOM FOM speeds and boundary conditions: v; = l on ADC; VF-0, D 1 /// DP = COS () on A R. When solving the problem, as in [1], an ANNA of the theory of the functions of a complex alternating (conformal display, the formula of Christophfle Schwartz) was used. As a result, an algorithm for calculating anode; The numerical calculations for various angles of p and different dl1m b. In the symmetrical case, comparisons are given with the results of the TAMs of other authors. Literature 1. Karimov A.Kh "Klokov V.V" Filatov e. AND .
