The continuity of the above module and transfinite diameter under the capacitor in RN we understand a pair (E0, E1) of non -empty non -overeating compact sets. We use the following designations: Mod (E0, E1) - the conformal capacitor module (E0, E1); DIST (A, B) - Khausdorfovo distance between compact sets, built on the basis of chord metric σ (x, y) in RN; DIAM (A) - the diameter of the set A ⊂ rn in the chord metric; D (a, b) = Inf {σ (x, y): x ∈ A, y ∈ B - the distance between the sets. Following the swing, we call the non -path -point compact set T ⊂ rn evenly perfect (uniformly perfect), if there is α> 0, such that there is no capacitor (E0, E1) with coherent plates and conformal module MOD (E0, E1) α α α for which t ⊂ e0∪e1, t ∩e0 6 = ∅ 6 = t ∩e1. Using the technique of relatively monotonous functions developed in the work [1] and [2], we get the following property of the uniform continuity of the conformal module: for any pair of α-annexily perfect compacts E, F ⊂ Rn and any compact k ⊂ rn non-equal capacity, such what min {d (k, e ∪ f), diam (e), diam (f)}> d; DIST (E, F) <PA; d> (2 + 4eα) Δ, 80 Assess | Mod (E, K) −MOD (F, K) | N -1 ≤ C (LN D 2PA) −1 with Constant C> 0, depending only on n and α. From here we derive the continuity of the above module in the following formulation, let {ej}-the sequence of α-anneously perfect compacts converging to the compact E according to the Hausdorf metrics. Then, for any point x0 ∈ Rn \ E, there is a convergence of the given modules Mod (X0, EJ) → Mod (X0, E). In particular, with n = 2, we obtain the continuity of transfinite diameter: if the sequence of α-anneously perfect compact sets {ej} in an extended complex plane converges in a hausdorfic metric to compact E, then for transfinite diameters there is a disintegration of durb (EJ) → Dear (E).
