One loaded integral equation for the Uxy + equation (a (x, y) u) x + (b (x, y) u) y + c (x, y) u = f (x, y) (1) in the rectangle ω = {(x, y): 0 <x <a, 0 <y <b} The task is studied: Find the solution of the equation (1) that satisfies the conditions A∫ 0 U (X, Y) DX = ψ (Y), B∫ 0 u (x, y) dy = onic (x). (2) When studying the resolution of the non -linear task (1) - (2), a loaded integral equation was obtained, equivalent to the task: u (x, y) - 1 a∫ 0 y∫ 0 audηdx - 1 a∫ 0 x∫ 0 budunk - 1 b b∫ 0 y∫ 0 aud type - - 1 b b∫ 0 x∫ 0 budnky + 1 ab a∫ 0 b∫ 0 y∫ 0 aud tyirdydx + 1 ab a∫ 0 b∫ 0 x∫ 0 budydydx + + y∫ 0 audη + x ∫ 0 bud ing + 1 ab a∫ 0 b∫ 0 y∫ 0 x∫ 0 cudădudx - - 1 a a∫ 0 y∫ 0 x∫ 0 cudorn type - 1 b b∫ 0 y∫ 0 x∫ 0 cude appearance type + + y∫ 0 x∫ 0 x∫ 0 x∫ 0 cudisingη = f (x, y), (3) 78 where f (x, y) is expressed through the functions gment gment (x), ψ (y) and f (x, y). Theorem. If conditions A (X, Y), B (X, Y), C (X, Y) ∈ C1 (ω̄), CXY (X, Y), F (X, Y) ∈ C (ONAH), lus (x, y) are met (x, y). x) ∈ C [0, A] ∩ c2 (0, A), ψ (Y) ∈ C [0, B] ∩ C2 (0, B), AY> 0, BX> 0, CXY> 0, AYBX - C2> 0, then a loaded integral equation (3) equivalent to the integrated equation of Voltaire's second kind. The theorem has been proven in two stages, each of which introduces a new unknown function. Regarding new unknown functions, integral equations have been obtained, unambiguous resolution of one of which is based on the theorem of the uniqueness of the task proven in [1) - (1) - (2). As a result of the transformations related to the representation of the solutions of the one -dimensional equations of Voltaire [2], we come to the equation U (x, y) - y∫ 0 x∫ 0 h̃ (ă, η, x, y) u (ă, η) ddition thigh = g̃ (x, y), where the core and right -hand part are expressed through the coefficients and the right side of the equation (1). Thus, the solution of the loaded equation (3) is a solution to the Voltaire equation (7). Using the presentation of H̃ (ă, η, x, y) the reverse is also proved: the opposite solution (7) satisfies the loaded equation (3). Literature 1. Keuchino.M., Pulkinal.S.

Lobachevsky, artkl@rambler.ru about the study of one task of determining the tension of the magnetic field of a given configuration, methods for creating electromagnetic fields of a given configuration play an important role in solving various applied tasks [1, 2]. In a quasi -stationary magnetic approximation, the equation for determining the voltage of the magnetic field can be written in the form of [3, 4]: 4πµσ C ∂h (x, t) ∂t + Rot Roth (X, T) = 4πσ C ROT Veste (X, T) (1) div h (x, t) = 0, [h (x, t)] τ = 0, x ∈ γ = ∂ω, h (x, t) | t = 0 = h0 (x), x ∈ ω ⊂ R3, H (X, Tfix), E ST (x, tfix): ω → R3, µ, σ-const> 0, where H is the magnetic field strength vector, is a given vector-function, which is often considered specified by an electromagnetic field, which is not an electromagnetic nature by origin; In the future, we will consider IS 80
