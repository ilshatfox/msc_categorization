The space of generalized functions with the explosive basic functions of several variables of D. M. Kinzebulatov Udmurt State University, Izhevsk, Damir@math.ucalgary.ca Let ω ⊂ Rn - an open subset, F - the family of final associations and differences in convex subservals ω. We denote through ĝ (ω) the algebra of limited functions g: ω 7 → R, such that for any x ∈ ω̄ and ε> 0 are the surroundings ux = ux (ε) ∈ F and {si} mi = 1 ⊂ f, such as such as that ux = ∪mi = 1si and | g (y1) - g (y2) | <ε for all y1, y2 ∈ Si (1 6 i 6 m) [1]. We endow ĝ (ω) SUP-Norm. Let SN -1 - a single sphere in RN with a center of 0. For each S ∈ SN -1, we put G (x0) (S). = Lim T → 0 + G (X0 + TS). Function G (x0) (·): SN -1 7 → R is determined everywhere on SN -1 and belongs to Linger (SN -1). We believe G1, G2 ∈ ĝ (ω) equivalent if G1 (x) (·) = G2 (x) (·) (x ∈ ω). The resulting factor-algebra is denoted by G (ω). In G (ω), the norm is determined the norm ‖g‖ (ω) = sup xuss {‖g (x) (·) ‖linger (SN -1)}. We denote through D (ω) the classic space of continuous basic functions. Let R (ω) - the space of the finite functions ∗ ∈ G (ω) (breakdown basic functions). Sets {onic ∈ R (ω): | onic (x) (·) | <γ (x) (x ∈ ω)} γ, where γ: ω 7 → R continuously, γ (x)> 0 (x ∈ ω) form a fundamental system of zero vicinences in R (ω). Then R (ω) LO 123 is convex, D (ω) - subspace R (ω). We denote through D ′ (ω) (r ′ (ω)) the space of linear continuous functionals on D (ω) (R (ω), respectively). The elements of spaces d ′ (ω), r ′ (ω) will be called generalized functions. Theorem. If F ∈ D ′ (ω), then there is a linear continuous continuation F C D (ω) on R (ω). We determine the product f ∈ R ′ (ω) and g ∈ G (ω) using (GF, ∗). = (F, Govern), where onic ∈ R (ω). The multiplication operation in R ′ (ω) is continuous, switching and associative. For p ∈ ω and α ∈ L1 (SN -1) (∫ SN -1 α (S) DS = 1), we determine (δαP, ∗) = ∫ SN -1 α (S) lus (p) (S) DS. For the basic functions onic ∈ D (ω) it is fair (δαP, lus) = ∫ SN-1 α (S) onic (p) ds = onic (p), i.e. δαp-continuation of delta-function Δp ∈ D ′ ( Ω) C D (ω) on R (ω). If n = 2, then we will identify S1 and [0, 2π). Let g (x) = σ, if x1> p1, x2> p2; g (x) = µ, if x1 <p1, x2 <p2; G (x) = 0 otherwise, where x = (x1, x2). We have (gδαp, ∗) ​​= ∫ π 2 0 α (s) onic (p) (s) ds + ∫ 3π 2 α (s) С (p) (s) ds. L and T R A T R A 1. DAVISON T.M.K. A Generalization of Regulation Functions // American. Math.
