One -leafful functions that implement the local extremum of the two functionals in the class S. G. Gushkalov Petrozavodsky State University, agush@petrsu.ru let s is the class of functions f (z) = z+ ger∑ n = 2 cnz n, one -leaved and analytical in the circle ∆ = {z: | z | <1}. On the set of all analytical in ∆ functions, we introduce the metric ρ (f, g) = max | z | = 1/2 | f (z) - g (z) |. (1) Let F = F (C2,., CN) and φ = φ (C2,., CN) - the function of the LE on S. Denote through SLOC (F, φ) many functions from S, realizing the local Extremum simultaneously for functions F and φ in the metric (1). A.C. Schaeffer and D.C. Spencer [1] showed that F0 ∈ SLOC (| cn |, | cm |) ⇐⇒ ⇐⇒ f0 ∈ Q = {Z (1 - ηz) (1 - σz), | η | = | σ | = 1} for mutually simple numbers N -1 and M - 1. Thus, the task of describing the set SLOC (f, φ) for f = | cn |, φ = | cm | and mutually simple n - 1 and m - 1. V.V. Starkov [2] a type of function was obtained, realizing the local extremum of the functionals | CN | and | cm | Without additional requirements for the functionals under consideration: if f0 ∈ SLOC (| cn |, | cm |), then f0 (z) = z [(1 - eiτ1zd0) (1 - eiτ2zd0)] - 1/d0. (2) 70 Here, the steppe function is understood as its main branch, τ1, τ2 - material, d0 - some total divider of numbers N - 1 and m - 1. This result was significantly generalized by V.V. Starkov (see [3]) for the functionals f = f (c2,., cn) = re [{α f (z) z + (1 - α) f ′ (z))} n - 1], φ = φ (c2, ., cm) = re [{ψ2 (β f (z) z + (1 - β) f ′ (z))} m -1], (3) where ψ1 (ζ) = ger l = 0 Al (ζ - 1) l, ψ2 (ζ) = φ∑ l = 0 bl (ζ - 1) l - functions regular in the vicinity of the point ζ = 1, a1b1 6 = 0; N 6 = M - natural numbers, M> 2, N> 2; α, β - complex. Consider the following functionality: F = F (C2,., CN) = re [{ψ1 (α f (z) z + (1 - α) [f ′ (z)] γ)} n - 1], φ = Φ (c2,., Cm) = re [{ψ2 (β f (z) z + (1 - β) [f ′ (z)] γ)} m - 1], (4) where γ - Complex. With γ = 1, they take the form (3). In this work, the condition of the functionals (4) is presented, when performing which, if F0 ∈ SLOC (F, φ), then F0 has the form (2). L and T R A T R A 1.

An illocal task with an integral condition for the parabolic equation of O. Yu. Danilkin Samara State Academy of Railways, danola@mail.ru will consider in the cylinder qt = {(x, t): x ∈ ω, t ∈}}, where Ω is a limited area in RN with a smooth boundary, the parabolic equation LU ≡ Ut - (aijuxj) xi + a (x, t) u = f (x, t). (1) Put for the equation (1) the task with the initial value U (x, 0) = onic (x) (2) and non -cabinal condition u | ST = ∫ t 0 ∫ ω k (x, y, t, τ) u (y, τ) dy dτ, 0 <t <t, x ∈ ∂ω. (3) Note that (3) is an integral condition. It causes to complete difficulties in the study of the task (1) - (3), and the camp of the research methods require a certain modifier. This work shows the possibility of transition from the study of the non-Konkalous task (1)-(3) to the study of the first bossal task for loaded parabolic equia. 72
