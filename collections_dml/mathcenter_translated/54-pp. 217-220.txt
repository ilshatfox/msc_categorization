UDC 517.98 C ∗-algebra, generated by a display, which induces the inverse half group A.Yu. Kuznetsova1 1 alla/kuznetsova@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the article discusses C ∗-albras generated by special species display. The display specified on the counting set induces the family of partial isometry operators, which generates the studied algebra. The work provides conditions under which this family multiplictively gives rise to an inverse half -group, and the corresponding algebras are studied. Keywords: C ∗-Algebra, inverse half-group, invariant subspace, general shift operator, algebra greenhouse. Let ffic: x - → x The display of the counting set X in itself, satisfying the condition of the Card pul - 1 [x] <mm for any x ∈ X. The graph (x, gment) with the vertices at the points of the set X and the ribs (x, onic (x)) is associated with the pair (x, ∗). C ∗-Algebra C ∗ ∗ (X), generated by the display ∗, is associated with this graph. The structure C ∗ ∗ (x) was proposed in [1]. We assume that the graph (x, gment) is coherent. In addition, we believe that wor (x) ̸ = x is not with any n ∈N and x ∈ X. 218 Materials of the International School-Conference specified for X The reflection induces on it a partial order (ffic) and the ratio of ising elevalent. Let's say that x ≺ y, if there is such n ∈N, that ther (y) = x. Let's say that the elements x and y n-elvivient, x n∼ y, if wor (x) = ware (y), and ∗ is elivalent, x peace, if they are n-excessive for some n purpose. The family of functions {ex} xuss, where ex (y) = δx, y (δx, y is the symbol of the crownker), faces a natural orthonomated basis in L 2 (x). Relations of ising ising and ∗ equivalence can be extended to the basic vectors, identifying the element of the base ex with the corresponding element x ∈ X. Display ffic is induced by the closed operator tular: l 2 (x) - → l 2 (x); Tther F = F ° 8, with which the family of partial isometry operators is associated with U = {uk} k organ, taper = u1 + p 2u2 +. . . + p mum +. . . where the UK partial isometry with the initial space l 2 (xk) = {f ∈ L 2 (x): t ∗ ∗ f = k f} and the final l 2k = {f ∈ L 2 (x): taper ∗ ∗ f = k f f f. }. Under the algebra generated by the display gment, the operator algebra C ∗ ∗ (x) generated by the specified family of partial isometries is understood. Families U and U ∗ multiplying generatively generate the invuloving half -group Mon (X), the elements of which are called monomas. Obviously, the linear combinations of monomas are dense in C ∗ ∗ (x). In [2] the criterion of the ignorance C ∗ ∗ (x) is given. Theorem 1. The following conditions are equivalent: 1) C ∗ ∗ (x) is irrelevant on L 2 (x); 2) from equality (W EX, EX) = (W EY, EY) for anyw ∈ Mon (x) EX = EY. This criterion allows you to introduce another equivalence on the basic vectors. Let's say that the basic vectors EX and EY are ω -excessive, ex ω∼∼y, if for any W ∈ Mon (x) is performed (W EX, EX) = (W EY, EY). It is easy to check that ω is indeed the ratio of equivalence and breaks the set {ex} x∈X into non -overeating classes. Let JX0 = {EX: ex ω∼X0} - the equivalence class of the basic vector EX0. We are interested in when the half -group Mon (X) is inverse, that is, it consists only of partial isometries. For details about the inverse half groups and the associated algebraic constructions, see [3], [4]. Theorem 2. The following conditions are equivalent: 1) the half -group Mon (x) is inverse. 2) from the condition ex ∗ pioneers, ex ω~∼∼yy follows. The previous theorem can be formulated as follows: A.Yu. Kuznetsova 219 so that the half-group Mon (x) is inverse, it is necessary and enough to make it possible for any two ffic-eject elements X and Y the mutually unambiguous display χ: x-→ x such that χ® pan and χ χ χ (x) = y. Suppose that the set of U is manual, that is, together with U ∗ gives rise to an inverse half -group. We set on monks the following action of a single circle α: S1 - → Autc ∗ ∗ (x); α (z) v = z indv v, v ∈ Mon (x) and continue according to continuity. We denote through C accord, 0, the fixed subpulbire regarding the action of the circumference α. The investigation. Podalgebrac pul, 0 switching ahead of the head, whenu gives rise to the inverse half -group. Note that c accord, 0 is AF -albro. If U is a manual set, then C accord, 0 is generated by the underground of the Idempotents Mon (X). The set x is called ising ising if the corresponding family of partial isometries U is manual. Let e ​​(x) = {y ∈ X: x ≺ y}, and e (x) = {y ∈ X: x ip lling y}. Offer. Let x-∗-brown set. Let there be at least one x ∈ X, such that the many E (x) is final. Then E (x) is the final set for any x ∈ X and JX = {Ey: Y ∈E (x)}. If x is ∗-bar, then you can completely describe
