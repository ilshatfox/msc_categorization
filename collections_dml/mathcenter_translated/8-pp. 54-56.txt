) Positively interpolation spaces for a pair of ordered banach spaces everywhere further X = (X0, X1) indicate an interpolation pair of ordered banach spaces, i.e., we believe that the banakh of the XI spaces with closed sponge ki cones are invested in some separated topological vector space V C. Closed cone V +, and ki ⊂ v + (i = 0, 1). Through L+(x) we denote the many limited linear operators in pair X, translating Ki into ki (I = 0, 1). Definition. The space X with a closed cone K ⊂ v + invested in the X0 + X1 Banakhovo will be called positively interpolation for pair X if any operator from L + (X) translates K to K. Offer. If the space X with the K cone is positively interpolarly for X and the cone k generating, then X interpolation for positive operators in X, i.e., any operator from L+(x) translates X to X and there is constant C> 0 that ‖T ‖X → X ≤ c max {‖t‖x0 → x0, ‖t‖x1 → x1} for any t ∈ L+(x). We give one method of constructing a positively interpol spaces. Let Y - the space interpolation for pair X in the usual sense, and let KY - the closure of K0 ∩ K1 in Y. Put ỹ = {x = x ′ - x ′ ′: x ′, x ′ ′ ∈ Ky}, ‖X‖ ỹ = inf {‖X′‖‖y + ‖X′‖y: x = x ′ - x ′ ′; x ′, x ′ ′ ∈ Ky}. 54 Theorem. The space ỹ with the norm ‖ · ỹ ỹ and the ky cone is positively interpolation for a pair X. Similarly, you can build positively interpolation spaces based on one of the KI cones and the interpolation space containing the XI. We illustrate the proposed design on the example of constructing an serial analogue of the intersection space for a pair of non -communist spaces L1, Lux. Let H - a sepaable calbert space with some highlighted basis, b is the algebra of all limited operators in H. Each operator a ∈ B is presented as an endless matrix A = (AI, J) φ, j = 1. Let (αi) φ I = 1 - according to the advance of strictly positive numbers, satisfying the condition ∑ et I = 1 α 1/2 i <mm. For the positive operator A = (AI, J) ger, J = 1, we put ffic (A) = ∑ happen i = 1 (A2i --1,2i-1 + αia2i, 2i). Then ∗ is the exact normal semi -inferior weight on B. Now we take the material space L1 (∗) as x1, and as x0 - the material space Linger (∗), realized as the spaces of ermital bilinear forms on the lines of weight - dense lineal in h ( See, e.g., [1]). These spaces make up an interpolation pair of ordered banach spaces, if we count the cone Ki in them with formed positive bilinear forms. As an interpolation space Y, we take a banahovo space of the intersection of the engine of engine = x0∩x1 and build a space ∆̃ according to the above scheme. The resulting space ∆̃ is loosely invested in ∆ and unmarried into ∆. We emphasize that in the considered example ∆̃ is not only not interpolation for pair X in the usual sense, but is not even intermediate for X.

Vladova (Ulyanovsk) The probability of space with a unitaryly generated one and a half -line form in this message describes the half -following, and in terms of half -traces - probability on the hyperbolic logic of projectors. Let M - the algebra of the Neumann in the Hilbert space h and let U: = ∫ eiison, the unitary operator. Algebra M is called W ∗ U -algebra, if m ⊆ r ′ (U2). W ∗ u -algebra m is called W ∗ P -albro, if at least one of the projectors p+: = eπ --0 or p -: = i -eπ -0 is final relative to the Let PU: = {p ∈ M: p2 = p, (upx, y) = (ux, py), ∀x, y ∈ H}. Projector P ∈ PU is called the maximum positive (maximum negative) if the pH is the maximum positive (maximum negative) subspace relative to indepinite metric ((2p+−i) x, y), x, y ∈ H. Let p+u (p --u) - a lot of all positive (negative) projectors in PU, and P+M (P - M) are many maximum positive (maximum negative) projectors in PU. For any p ∈ P ± u, we denote through E ± p the orthopriotector on p ± pH. Each projector E ∈ PU seems (not the only way!) In the form E = E + + E -, E ± ∈ P ± U. The material measure µ: pu → R is called half a trace if there are an exact normal semi -inferior trace and the operator m attached to the center of the algebra is such that: or p+t ∈ L1 (m, τ) and then µ (e) = τ (τ (e) TE+) ∀E ∈ PU or p --t ∈ L1 (m, τ) and then µ (e) = τ (te -) ∀e ∈ Pu. For a factor case, the weakened version of the theorem 1 formulated below was previously proved by M. S. Matveychuk. Theorem 1. Let µ: pu → r measure on w ∗ u -algebra. Ple 56
