UDC 517.54 On certain conditions of the unity of the root of the equation Gakhov S.A. Gubaidullina1, A.V. Kazantsev2 1 sumbel.gubaydullina@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, Institute of Computing Mathematics and Information Technologies 2 Avkazantsev63@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University, the Institute of Computing Mathematics and Information Technologies The article discusses a new condition for the uniqueness of the root of the Gakhov equation. Key words: Gakhov equation, Gakhov class. The next statement is established as part of the approach used in the work [1], [2]. Let H̃0 - the class of all holomorphic and local single -leaf functions f (ζ) = ζ+. . . In the circle d = {ζ ∈C: | ζ | <1}, G̃1-a regular class of Gakhova, consisting of 136 materials of the international school-conference of all functions F ∈ H̃0, for which the Gakhov equation f ′ ′ (ζ)/ f ′ (ζ) = 2ζ̄/ (1-| ζ | 2 ) It has the only zero root, which is the maximum of a hyperbolic derivative (conformal radius) h F (ζ) = (1- | ζ | 2) | F ′ (ζ) | functions f [3]. Theorem. Function f ∈ H̃0 is fair, satisfying the conditions ≤ | F ′ (ζ) | ≤ m and | arg f ′ (ζ) | ≤ α with ζ ∈D, belongs to the class of Gakhov G̃1 if Q (1+λ) K (λ) ≤ 1, where Q = ln (m/m), k (λ) = ´ 1 0 [(1-u2) (1–λ2u2)] - 1/2DU, and the value is λ = λ (q, α), 0 ≤λ≤ 1, is determined from the equation 4αk (λ) = qk (p 1–λ2). The report discusses a number of aspects related to this theorem and its proof. Literature 1. Avhadiev F. G., Aksentiev L. A.

In particular, we calculate the tensor ranks of the elements of standard resolvent for a module consisting of summarized sequences.
