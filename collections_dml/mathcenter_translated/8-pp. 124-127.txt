) A new version of the vector QD-algorithm Classic QD-algorithm Let {SN} is some sequence. QD- (QUOTIENT-DIFFORENCE) The algorithm in the classic version [1] is the calculation of the following type: Q (0) 1 E (0) 1 Q (1) 1 Q (0) 2 E (1) 1 · · · · · · · · · · Q (2) 1 · · · · · · · · · ·, (1) Elements of which are connected by formulas Q (ν) n + e (ν) n = q (ν + 1) n + e (ν + 1) n −1 (2) q (ν) n+1e (ν) n = q (ν+1) n e (ν+1) n, (3) 124 where n = 1, 2 ,. . . , ν = 0, 1 ,. . .. Initial conditions are selected in the form of e (n) 0 = 0, Q (ν) 1 = Sa +1 Sν (4) One of the classicqd algorithm applications is the decomposition of the formal power row f (z) = S0 +S1Z +S2Z2 + . . . In the continuous fraction of the species f (z) ∼ s0 || 1 - q (0) 1 z | | 1 - e (0) 1 z | | 1 - Q (0) 2 Z | | 1 - e (0) 2 z | | 1 - · · · Suitable fractions of this decomposition give diagonal approximations to a week of the formal steppe series. Another important property of the algorithm is the convergence of the QD tables to zeros and poles of the corresponding measorphic functions [5]. Vector QD-algorithm (J. Van Izeghem). In the works [2], [3], when studying the properties of joint approximations of the Hermitapade for a certain system of Markov functions - → F = (F1, F2,., FP), where fj (z) = ∫ ∆j dµj (x)) z-x = ger∑ k = 0 s (j) k zk+1, a variant of vector QD-algorithm was proposed. In the vector case, we believe that each element is SN = [S (1) N, S (2) N ,. . . , s (p) n] t is a column of p elements. The denominators {qn} of the joint approximations of the Hermita-Pad are vector orthogonal polynomials, which satisfy the recurrent ratio of the type QN+1 = (z-an, n) qn-an, n-1qn-1-. . .-n-pqn-p, (5) vector qd-table has the following view: QaveN-1 q ν-1 n eνn-1 n ν qν+1n-1 ν n eν+1n-1n-1n-1n-1n-1n-1n-1N E ν n qν+2n -1 q ν+1 n, (6) 125 Where EaNN = (E ν n, i) i = n - P, ..., R -1, R ≥ 0, ν ≥ 0. The initial conditions are set in the form of eν0 = 0, q ν 1 = s (1) ν+1 s (1) ν, qνn+1 = hν+1n+1h ν h Hνn+1h ν+1 n, (7) where h where h. (ν) n - the corresponding {sn} determinants of Gankel times the dimension of n × n with the upper left element Sν. Formulas (2)-(3), connecting the elements of QD tables, were expanded in the vector case to qν+1n+1+e ν+1 n, n-1 = q ν+1+e ν+1, n+1, n+1, n+1, n (8) eaa+1n, i q ν+1 i+1+e ν+1 n, i -1 = e ν n, q ν n+1+e ν n+1, i = n - p+ one, . . . - N - 1, (9) Eaν+1N, N ---PQ ν+1 n --P+1 = e ν n, n - pq ν n+1, n ≥ d. (10) One of the appendices of the vector QD-algorithm is to find the coefficients of recurrent ratios (5) for vector orthogonal polynomials. A new version of the vector qd algorithm. In the proposed new version of the vector QD-algorithm, the corresponding determinants of Gankel HK, DN, N = PK + D Dimensions N × N are selected with the upper left element S (D + 1) K. This allows you to share a more general version of the algorithm for which the ratio of elements of vector QD tables are similar to the classic scalar version. It is, instead of the ratios (8)-(10) we have βν+1n+α ν+p n-1 = β ν n+α nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu+1n α ν+p n = β ν+1α nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu nu (12) with the initial conditions αν0 = 0, β ν 1 = S D+1 K+1/S D+1 K. The new version covers a more complete number of vector orthogonal polynomials, which allows you to get a more effective way to calculate their recurrent coefficients. The 126th report provides the results of numerical experiments and a comparative analysis of various versions of the algorithm.
