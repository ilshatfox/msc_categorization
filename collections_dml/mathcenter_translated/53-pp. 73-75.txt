Mathematical modeling of the processes of transfer in the channel formed by two cylinders within the framework of the free -molecular regime solved the problem of the heat -massive in a long channel formed by two cylinders, the radius of the R′1 and R ′ 2, which form the paralle of the lolne, and the axes are shifted relative to each other by the distance a ′ . The channel maintain constant gradients of tours and pressure temperatures. As the main equation, describing the process of the process, the equation of Williams was used, recorded in the cylindrical coordinate system [1], and in the form of the boundary condition on the wall of the canal - a diffusion model. The deviation of the gas state from the equilibrium is supposed to be small, which allows you to get a solution to the problem in a linarized form. To find a linear amendment to the local-moral distribution function, the task is reduced to the solution of a linear uniform differential equalization in private derivatives of the first order C⊥ cosψ ∂z ∂ro + c⊥z ∂z ∂z ∂ sinψ ρz ∂z + + + + + + 1 = 0 (1) 74 O.V.

Using the obtained solution, the mass velocity vector in the channel was built and the values ​​of heat and mass flow through the cross section of the canal were found. An analysis of the obtained solutions was carried out in the limit case when the cylinder axes coincide. It is shown that in this case, the results obtained in the work are transferred to similar reckonings obtained for coaxial cylinders. The work was performed with financial support in the framework of the state assignment “Creation of computational infra of the structure to solve high -tech applied problems” (about ECT No. 3628). V.
