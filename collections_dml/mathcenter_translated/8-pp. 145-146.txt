One hypothesis of the overdeck relating to the systems of complex functions that satisfy Haar in 1971, continuing the research of the Marchewuber, Schlenberg and Yang [1], formulated the hypothesis [2], according to which the coherent continuum Q, allowing the system of linearly independent comprehensive continuous functions, satisfying the condition of Haar, homeomorphine flat subset. As A. Haar showed in the material case, and A. N. Kolmogorov [3] - in the complex, polynomes according to the system of functions with the condition of the Haar, given and continuously on the compact Q, have the property of the uniqueness of the best approximation for any continuous function, t . Haara condition characterizes Chebyshev systems. We consider the task with additional restriction of NAQ, namely, we require arcuardous coherence of not only the Q Continuum itself, but also each of its percontinum and call this 145 property of hereditary arcuate connectedness by analogy with the property of hereditary local coherence [4]. Theorem. The hereditarily ardent coherent continuum, which allows the Chebyshev system of complex continuous functions of order n ≥ 2, is homomorphone for the subsets of the complex plane.

Strekogorsky (Kazan) Sparra method in the spaces of Besov Interpolation Method of Sparra [1] is a multidimensional analogue of the well-known K-method Peter. Its function (·, ·,.,., ·) ~ Θ, q act on sets of (n+1) ’ā = (a0, a1,..., AN). The implementation of the Sparra method in specific classes of spaces is greatly difficult in the fact that well -known theorems about stability (analogues of theorem about reiteration for the Peter method) contain an additional requirement that ā ā θ, q, k = ā θ, θ, j.
