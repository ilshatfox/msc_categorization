) The dynamics of the holomorphic display of the circle in the theory of functions and its applications in the holomorphic dynamics (i.e., the dynamics of the icorned holomorphic displays of the Riman surface in itself) the case of the circle occupies a special place and has numerous applications. It differs significantly from the classical case of rational display of the Riman sphere. In this case, the behavior of the orbits is determined by the known Danjua -Volof theorem, according to which, if F is the holomorphic display of the unit circle D into itself, different from the mebius transformation, then the sequence of iterations f 1 = f, fn = f ° fn - 1, n = 2 , 3,. . . , converges locally evenly in D to some constant Q, | Q | ≤ 1. At the same time, Q is called the dunzhua -volfa point and is a motionless (internal or boundary) point of function F. The behavior f in the vicinity of Q in many ways determines the dynamic properties of this display. Therefore, the allocation of half -groups of analytical functions based on the nature of behavior in the vicinity of the Danjua -Volof point and the study of the structure of these half -groups led to solving a number of problems of the theory of functions and the theory of branching random processes. The report is devoted to the review of some recently obtained results in this direction. V.I. Danchenko (Vladimir, danch-m2@vpti.vladimir.su) Bernsteinovsky assessment for a derivative of a derivative function, let K-compact on an open integrated plane C. With natural n, we denote all rational functions of R degree through RN (K) ≤ n, the poles of which do not lie on k. Consider the task of the conditions of existence at a fixed point z ∈ K estimates of the species | r (s) | ≤ c (k, z, n, s) · ‖r‖‖ (k), r ∈ Rn (k), (1) where S = 1, 2 ,. . ., C (K, Z, N, S) - a final positive value that depends only on these arguments (which does not depend on the choice of the rational function R ∈ RN (K)). Unlike polynomials, for 34 those assessments (1), there are any point z ∈ K of the coherent compact K (Bernstein’s inequalities, Markov and their various generalizations), on any compact K, you can indicate the point Z, such that SUP {| R (s) (z) | · ‖R‖ - 1 c (k): r ∈ Rn (k)} = ger, s = 1, 2 ,. . . Let Z ∈ K and S> 0, R ∈ (0, inous]. Put ωs (k, z, r) = sup {ρ (ζ, k) | ζ - z | —s -1: ζ ∈ C \ K \ K \ K \ K \ K \ K \ K \ K , | ζ-z | ≤ r}, where ρ (ζ, k)-euclidean distance from ζ to k. The size ωs (k, z) = ωs (k, z, mm) will be called the compact of the compact K in point z. Theorem. Let K-an arbitrary compact on C. Then, so that at the point z ∈ K the assessment of the species (1) is necessary and sufficient by the limb of the S-porosity ωs (k, z) at this point. In addition , if ωs (k, z) <mm, then with all s, n ∈ N, r> 0 there are inequalities | r (s) (z) | ≤ as! (Nωs (k, z, r) + r - s) ‖r‖ (k), r ∈ Rn (k), and, in particular, | r (s) (z) | ≤ a1 s! · ωs (k, z) n ‖r‖ (k) (2) where a, a1 is absolute constant. Assessment (2) is accurate in the sense that with any n ∈ N, compact K, the rational function r ∈ Rn (k) and the point z ∈ K, for which inequality is performed, The opposite (2) (with some other constant A2). The investigation. If at some point z ∈ K at some α> 0 we have ωs (k, z, r) = o (rα), then | R (s) (z) | ≤ a (z) s! N ss+α ‖r‖c (k), r ∈ Rn (K). The work was carried out with the financial detention of the Russian Federation (project No. 0401-00717) and leading scientific schools (project NSh-1892.2003.1) 35)
