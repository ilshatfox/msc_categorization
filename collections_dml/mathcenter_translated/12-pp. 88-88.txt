Modeling the thermal field in the reactor with the interferences D.Yu. Ivanov, V.V. Klokov, E.I. Filatov Kazan State University E-Mail: Efilatov@ksu.n1 considered in this work, the installation is a cylindrical vessel with detected walls and a spiral plate inside. A propel is installed on the shaft, which is located along the axis of the SIM of the vessel; a 1 -p. During fashion, 1IRING THE Hydrodynamic Field, widhing assumptions were made: the fluid is inhuman, and the course was potential and stationary. In this case, the Equation of Incompletion and Council, 1 Odi from the Section of Vorthy leads to the elliptical equalcture of the second on the row regarding the function of the current with the boundary conditions of the conductor. By. The AICH POPELERA was modeled by a given distribution of the cattle in the nodes located on it. When modeling the thermal field, the heating equation with the convective part was used. D.1, Temperori, setting the boundary conditions of the conductor .. on the walls of the reactor, on the C11 -bred along the upper and on the surface of the spiral heat exchanger. Symmetry conditions were set on the axis of rotation. The developed program allows you to analyze the influence of the location and speed of the propeller rotation, as well as the properties of the bone of the bone on the nature of the distribution of temperatures in the mass of the reagent. 88
