Finding the results of two whole functions E.K. Myshkina1 1 Elfifenok@mail.ru; The Institute of Computing Modeling of the SB RAS in the article discusses approaches to the result of two whole -free functions based on Newton's recurrent formulas. Keywords: whole functions, Newtonian formulas, results, recall the concept of a result of two polynomials F and G from one variable - this is the number R, which is equal to zero and only when the system F = G = 0 has common roots. Formally, r (f, g) = ∏ {z: f (z) = 0} g (z), (1) however, for calculating R, it is effective to use its representation in the form of the determinant of Sylvester: let f (z) = a0 + . . . + an zn and g (z) = b0 +. . . + BM ZM, denote DN, M = ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ A0 A1 A2. . . 0 0 a0 a1. . . 0. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0. . .

One of the approaches to determining the results in the case when G (Z) is a whole function G (Z) = B0 +. . . + BM ZM +. . . , consists in the consideration of the limit of lim m - → φa −m n dn, m, however, the analysis of this limit is quite complicated. According to the approach examined in [1] 126 “Lobachev readings - 2019” R F, G = 1 N! ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ S1 1 0. . . 0 S2 S1 1. . . 0. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . SN SN -1. . . . . . S1, ∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣∣ Where SK is the sum of the values ​​of the G K function in zero functions f (z). At the same time, SK are calculated as the limit of the sequence of determinants from the functions of F, G, G 2, G 3 ,. . . . We offer another approach [2], based on the direct generalization of the formula (1). In this case, the result is presented in the form of an infinite amount of expressions depending on the coefficients of functions F and G, as well as the degree amounts of the roots of the polynomial f (z). Example. Consider the system of equations {f (z) = z2 —A2, g (z) = ebz = ∑icle = 1 (bz) nn! = 1 + bz + (bz) 22! +. . .+ (bz) nn! +. . . . Then 2∏ i = 1 g (zi) = φ∑ k = 0 (−1) k (AB) 2K (K!) 2 +2 ger∑ t = 0 ger∑ j = 1 (−1) t (AB) 2T +2 j t! (T +2 j)! = 1. Note that the first amount in this expression is the function of Bessel of the first kind J0 (2AB). Thus, we obtain the identity φ∑ t = 0 ger∑ j = 1 (−1) t (AB) 2T +2 J T! (T +2 J)! = 1 - J0 (2AB) 2. In addition, it should be noted that this approach allows a generalization in the event that F is also a whole function, since the degree amounts of zeros F can be calculated combinators [3].

It includes preliminary processing of information, highlighting significant features necessary to improve the quality of the classification, and directly the classification itself. Preliminary processing of the document at the first stage of the counting, the document is submitted in the form of many terms. Each term is made in line with weight - the characteristic designating the occurrence of this term. The n-dimensional space obtained in this way is the space of signs for this multiple
