The procedures for approaching the functional classes by polynomas according to the generalized Haar system, let RD-d-dimee Euclidean space of points X̄ = (X1, ..., XD) with material coordinates; Id = {x̄ ∈ RD; 0 6 xj 6 1; j = 1, ..., d}-d-dimensional cubic cube. Banakhovo space X measurable according to the Lebag on ID functions is called symmetrical if (see [1], p. 123): From what | f (x̄) | 6 | g (x̄) | Almost everywhere on ID and G ∈ X, it follows that F ∈ X and ‖F‖ 6 ‖G‖X; from f ∈ X and equivalent measurement of functions | f (x̄) | and | g (x̄) | It follows that g ∈ X and ‖f‖ = ‖g‖x. Here and in the future, ‖f‖x means the norm of the element f ∈ X. Let χE (t) - the characteristic function of the set E ⊂ ID. Function ∗ (µe) = ‖χe‖x is called the fundamental function of space X, where µE is the measure of the LEBER of the set E. So, the fundamental function of the symmetric space X is the function onic (t) = ‖χ [0, t] ‖x, determined on the segment [0.1]. The function С (t) of symmetric space can be considered concave, non -renewed, continuous on [0.1], and С (0) = 0 (see [1], p. 137). Such functions are called φ function. Further, X (∗) means a symmetrical space with a fundamental function ∗. In the future, we will consider the maximum symmetric spaces, i.e., those for which equality is true ‖f‖ = sup ‖g‖ cycle ∫ id f (x̄) g (x̄) dx̄, where x ′ (ng) is dual Symmetric space to x (∗). Note that wor (t) = t/onic (t) for t ∈ (0, 1] and ∗ (0) = 0 (see [1], p. 144). Examples of maximum symmetric spaces: lq (i d ) - the space of the Lebag with the norm ‖f‖ =  ∫ ∫ d | f (x̄) | qdx̄   1/q, 1 6 q < +φ; Martsinkevich space MQ (ID) with the norm ‖f‖, urb = SUP T] (0.1] T1/Q -1 ∫ T 0 F τ) Dτ, 1 6 Q < +inous, 50 Where F ∗ (τ) is an irreversible rearrangement of functions | F (X̄) | (see. [1], p. 83); the space of the lorentz lqθ (id) with the norm ‖f‖ = {θ q ∫ 1 0 (∫ t 0 f τ) dτ) θ tθ (1/q - 1) −1dt } 1/q < +φ, 1 6 q < +φ, 1 6 θ < +φ. For a given function ψ (t), t ∈ [0, 1], we put αψ = lim t → 0 ψ (2t) ψ (t), βψ = lim t → 0 ψ (2t) ψ (t). It is known that for any symmetric space x (ffic) the inequality 1 6 αarent 6 β 8 6 2 2 (see [1]). Through ω f, t̄) x ≡ ω (f, t1, ..., td) x = sup 06hj6tj j = 1, ..., d ∥∥∥∥∥∆ 1̄ h̄ f d∏ j = 1 χ [0,1- hj] (xj) ∥∥∥∥∥ x denote the mixed module of the continuity of the function f ∈ X (∗), where ∆1̄ h̄ f (x̄) = ∆1h1 (... ∆ 1 hd f (x1, ..., xd )) - mixed function AI F ∈ X (∗). Let ω (t̄) - a function of the type of mixed continuity module. We look at the functional class hωx (∗) = {f ∈ X (gment): ω (f, t̄) x 6 ω (t̄), t̄ ∈ Id}. In the case of ω (t̄) = d∏ j = 1 trj, instead of h ω x (∈), we will write H r x (gment). Through C (q, p, r, ...) we denote the positive constant, depending on these parameters. Record a ³ b means that there are positive constant C1, C2, such that C1a 6 b 6 C2A. Consider the generalized Haar system defined on the segment [0.1]. Let the sequence of {pn} natural numbers pn> 2 for all n = 1, 2, .... The generalized Haara {pn} = {χn (t)} is determined as follows (see [2], [3]): Put χ1 (t) ≡ 1 on the segment [0, 1]. The set natural number n> 2 will introduce in the form n = mk + r (pk + 1 - 1) + s, where mk = p1 · p2 · ... · pk; k = 1, 2, ...; R = 0, 1, ..., mk - 1; S = 1, 2, ..., pk+1 - 1. through a, we denote many points of the type L/mk on the segment [0.1]. Then if t ∈ B ≡ [0, 1] \ A, then the decomposition t = ger∑ k = 1 αk (t) mk, αk (t) = 0, ..., ..., pk - 1, 51 is the only one. Next, we determine the function χn (t) ≡ χSK, r (t) as follows: χn (t) = χ s, r (t) = {√ mkexp {2πisαk+1 (t)/pk+1}, t ∈ (r/mk, (r + 1)/mk) ∩b, 0, t/∈ [R/mk, ​​(r + 1)/mk]. Taking advantage of the fact that the set B everywhere tightly on [0.1], the function is χm (t) by continuity will continue to the interval (R/mk, ​​(R + 1)/Mk). Then, at the gap points, this function is placed equal to the semi -drying of its limit values ​​on the right and left, and at the ends of the segment [0.1] - its limit values ​​from the inside of the segment. Thus, a certain system {pn} is orthonomated and full in space L1 (see [1], [3]). Let {p (j) nj} - sequences of natural numbers p (j) nj> 2; nj = 1, 2, ...; j = 1, 2, ..., d, and m (j) nj = p (j) 1 · ... · p (j) nj. Through {χn̄ (x̄)} = {d∏ j = 1 χnj (xj)} we denote the multiple generalized Haar system; an̄ (f) - factors Fourier functions f ∈ L1 (ID) according to this system. Let tn̄ (x̄) = n1∑ k1 = 1 ... nd∑ kd = 1 ak1, ..., kd d∏ j = 1 χkj (xj) = ∑ 1̄6k̄6n̄ ak̄χk̄ (x̄) is Polina according to the general Haara system nj by variable xj. Here the inequality K̄ 6 N̄ is ​​understood in the sense that KJ 6 NJ, for all j = 1, ..., d. Put δν̄ (f, x̄) = m (1) ν1+1 −1∑ n1 = m (1) ν1 ... m (1) νd+1 −1∑ nd = m (d) νd an1, ... , nd (f) d∏ j = 1 χkj (xj), sn (f, x̄) = ∑ ‖s̄̄̄6n Δs̄ (f, x̄), where ‖s̄̄ = d∑ j = 1 sj. The procedures for approaching the HRθ classes according to the norm of the space of the LQ (I D) space by linomas according to the multiple of the Haar system with harmonics from hyperbolic “crosses” were investigated by A.V. Andrianov [4]. In the proposed note, the procedures for the approach of the functional classes of HRX (ffic) polynomas are studied
