) Flea derivatives with Blokhov Premesanians The main strategy for the study of many holomorphic and locally single -leafy in the circle E = {| ζ | <1} Functions F with the only extremum of the flea derivative (1 - | ζ | 2) | F ′ (ζ) | It is to study the properties of diving A in various functional classes. The properties of three of these dives are discussed: 1) display that compares the function F of its Schwartz derivative sf = f ′ - f 2/2, where f = f ′ ′/f ′ - pre -jets, 2) identical immersion a into the space of the holomorphic functions with an uniform topology convergence on compacts, and 3) immersion F 7 → F into the space of the flea with the prenature | f | b = submar (1 - | ζ | 2) | f ′ (ζ) |. In particular, the theorem is fair. If the holomorphic in E function F satisfies the condition | F ′ ′/F ′ | b = 2, then f ∈ A. The set A (identified with its image when immersed in b) is absorbing, but is neither balanced (even in the case of F (0) = 0), nor star -shaped. However, when limited to subspace b̃ = {f ∈ B: f (0) = 0}, the set ã = a ∩ b̃ acquires starship (the justification of which develops the technique of parametric families from [1]), which allows us to describe ã0 and ã - in terms of the functionality of Mingkovsky ρ for A; So, ã0 = {bf: f ∈ S1 and b <b̃ (f)}, 119 where B̃ is determined in the unit sphere S1 with the formula b̃ = 1/ρ. The intersection of ∂a ∩ {f ∈ B: | b ≤ 2} is a stratification over S1, from which, when replacing B space, a conductor with a prenature | g | d = {(1/π) ∫∫ e | g ′ (ζ) | 2Dising type 1/2 remains only the layer above f (ζ) = ζ.

Kalyagin (Nizhny Novgorod) Vector case of the theory of Stiltyes (orthogonal polynomials and operators) The classical theory of Stiltyes [1] connects the problem of the points on the half -shafts with the continuous fraction of Stiltyes and a certain sequence of orthogonal polynomials. The problem of the moments can also be considered as part of the problem of self -intended expansion of a certain operator known as the Jacobi operator [2]. The continuous fraction of style and the orthogonal polynomials associated with it play an important role in analyzing the spectral properties of the Jacobi operator. The tasks of rational approximations with a common denominator to a set of functions (approximation of the Hermita-Pad) lead to the need to study polynomial systems, orthogonal in relation to a set (vector) of measures. Such systems of polynomials are called polynomials of joint orthogonality or vector orthogonal polynomials. The most important characteristic property of vector orthogonal polynomials is the presence of a high -order recurrent ratio that connects them, the study of which is equivalent to the study of a certain vector continuous fraction [3]. The same recurrent ratio allows you to associate with the system of vector orthogonal polynomials of some 120
