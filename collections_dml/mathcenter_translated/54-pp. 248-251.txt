UDC 517.95 On the relationship of solvability of regional tasks for the Poisson equation on non -combact Riman varieties E.A. Mazepa1 1 Elena.mazepa@volsu.ru; Volgograd State University in this work, using a sufficiently new approach to setting marginal tasks on an arbitrary non -membranous Riman variety M, based on the introduction of classes equivalent to m functions, establish a dependence between the resolution of regional and external regional tasks for the Poisson equation in the class of unlimited continuous functions . Keywords: Poisson equation, regional and external marginal tasks, uncomproped Rimannes of diversity, the task of the conductor. In recent years, a large number of works have been published devoted to the resolving of various regional tasks for harmonic functions, for solving the stationary equation of Schrödinger, for some other homogeneous linear and quasi -line elliptical equations. At the same time, studies of heterogeneous elliptical equations are single and are devoted mainly to the study of asymptotic behavior of solutions of these equations [1]- [2], and not issues of solvability for them of regional tasks. In this work, we propose using a sufficiently new approach to the setting of regional tasks on non -membranous riman varieties, based on the introduction of the concepts of classes equivalent to the variety of continuous functions (including unlimited), to investigate the resolution of marginal and external regional tasks for the Poisson equation ∆U = G (x), (1) where the function is G (x) ∈Cγ (ω) for any subset ω⊂⊂ M, 0 <γ <1. E.A. Mazepa 249 in particular, the work establishes the dependence between the resolution of the regional and external regional tasks for the equation (1) on an arbitrary non -membrane riman variety. By solving the equation (1) on diversity M, we mean the function U ∈ C 2 (ω), which satisfies this equation on any compact subset ω⊂ M. Previously described below, the approach was used to study the issues of resolving marginal tasks for the equations of Laplace-Belter, the equations of Schrödinger, a number of semi-linear and quasilinear elliptical equations to arbitrary non-combact Riman varieties (see, e.g., [3]-[5]). Let b ⊂ m - an arbitrary coherent compact subset with a smooth border ∂b and a non -resistant insides, {bk} ger k = 1 - exhaustion of diversity m, that is, a sequence of pre -compact submarines of Rimanov diversity ms such that b k ⊂ bk+1, m, m, m, m, m, m, m. = ⋃ happen k = 1 bk. Let F1 (x) and F2 (x) - arbitrary continuous (including unlimited) on m functions. Determination 1. We will say that the functions F1 (X) and F2 (X) are equivalent to m (and denote f1 (x) ∼ f2 (x)) if for some exhaustion {bk} ger = 1 diverse M is made by lim k → ∞ || F1 (x) - f2 (x) || C 0 (m \ bk) = 0, where || f (x) || C 0 (g) = supg | f (x) |. We denote the class of equivalent f functions through [f]. The introduced attitude is indeed the ratio of equivalence (that is, it is reflexively, symmetrically and transitively), does not depend on the choice of exhaustion of diversity M and characterizes the behavior of functions outside the arbitrary compact subset B ⊂ M (see, e.g., [3] - [5 ]). Determination 2. We will call the function F asymptotically non -negative nm (and denote F & 0), if there is a continuous function W ≥ 0 on M, W ∼ F. Determination 3. We will say that the G -asymptotically does not exceed the function F by m (and denote g. F) if the difference F - G on m is an asymptotically non -negative function. The following auxiliary statements take place. Lemma 1. If g. f and f. G on m, then g ∼ f on m. The reverse statement is also true. Lemma 2 (comparison principle 1). Let ∆V ≤ ∆U on m \ b, v | ∂b ≥ u | ∂b, v ∼ u. Then V ≥ U on m \ b. Let ∆V ≤ently on m and v ∼ u. Then V ≥ U on m. Lemma 3 (Comparison principle 2). Let ∆V ≤ ∆U on m \ b, v | ∂b ≥ u | ∂b, v & u. Then V ≥ U on m \ b. Let ∆V ≤ently on m and v & u. Then V ≥ U on m. 250 Materials of the International School Conference 4. We will say that the regional task for equation (1) with boundary conditions from class [F] is solved m, if there is a solution of U (x) equation (1) such that u ∈ [F]. Determination 5. Let φ (x) ∈ C (∂B) - arbitrary function. We will say that on m \ b solve the external marginal task for the equation (1) with boundary conditions (φ, [f]), if m \ b exists a solution U (
