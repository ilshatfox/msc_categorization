. The geometry of directions in the spaces of incompatible curvature in the sense of Buzeman A. Yu. Kochnev Pomeranian State University named after MV Lomonosov, Arkhangelsk Let (X, D) - geodesically complete geodetic metric space. X is called the space of incompatible curvature in the sense of Buzeman (see [1]), if for any three points x, y, z ∈ X, for the arbitrary middle M between X and Y and for the arbitrary middle n between x and z, non -76 violence is performed. D (m, n) ≤ (1/2) d (y, z). For curves γ, δ: [0, b) → x with the common principle γ (0) = Δ (0) = X upper angle between them at point X is called ∠X (γ, δ) = lim S, t → 0 Arccos S2 + T2 - D2 (γ (S), Δ (t)) 2ST. In particular, for any curve γ at its starting point x = γ (0), the upper angle ∠X (γ, γ) is determined. They say that the curve γ: [0, b) → X has a direction at point x = γ (0), if ∠X (γ, γ) = 0. Let ∠X (γ, Δ) = 0. Then they say that they say that Curves γ and δ are in the same direction at point X. For a fixed point X, the attitude of “go in the same direction” is the ratio of equivalence on the many curves with the beginning of X with a direction. Each class of equivalence is called the direction in X. Let A: R → X-complete geodetic in the local compact G-spaces of incompatible curvature in the sense of Buzeman. We denote ω+(a) many points A in which its direct direction has more than one opposite. Theorem. Let X-local compact G-spaceship of incompatible curvature in Buzeman. Then, for any of its geodesical A, many ω+(A) is nothing more than a score. Note that in the conditions of the theorem there are many ω+(a) can be dense everywhere on a. A situation is also possible when geodetic a at each of its points has more than one continuation in each direction.

Kuzmina Chuvash State Pedagogical University, Cheboksary, Stolyarovav@chgpu.edu.ru we will consider the n-dimensional projective space PN. Hyperpolosomic distribution of M-somnic linear elements H (m <n-1) (that is, non-elonononal hyperpolos) is called [1] pair of distributions of the first kind, namely, the distribution of M-dimensional linear elements (a0, πm) and the distribution of hyperplioscopic elements (a0 , Πn -1) with the ratio of incidents: a0 ∈ πm ⊂ πn -1. In the first -order rhe, the differential equations of hyperpolosa distribution H have the form [1]: ωni = λ n ikω k 0; ω v i = λ v ikω k 0; ω n v = a n vαω α 0; ω i v = n i vkω k 0; i, j = 1, m; v = m + 1, n - m - 1; K = 1, n; Here, each of the sets of functions {λnij}, {anuv} forms a first -order tensor. Hyperpolosa distribution H with the field of unpertured tensors λnij, a n uv is called regular [1].
