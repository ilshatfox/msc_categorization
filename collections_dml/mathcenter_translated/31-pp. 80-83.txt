-MENITY OF THE PROBLEM OF GURS A.A. Kungurtsev Kazan State University Let X = (X1,., XN) ∈ D = {0 <xk <x0k, k = 1 ,. . . , n}, u = {u, ux1 ,. . . , Uxn, ux1x2 ,. . . , Uxn -1xn ,. . . , Ux1x3 ... xn ,. . . , Ux2 ... xn}, and all components of U can take the values ​​between −urb and +و (this area of ​​change U is denoted through t). Task. Find the function u (x) ∈ C (1, ..., 1) (D) ∩ c (D), which satisfies the equation UX1 ... xn = f (x, u), f ∈ C (D) ∩ C (t), (1) and conditions u (x) | xi = 0 = ∗ (x1., XI - 1, XI+1,., XN), I = 1 ,. . . , n, (2) where uction is the specified functions. Theorem. If f (x, u) satisfies the condition | f (x, u1) - f (x, u2) | ≤ a ∑ s | θ1s - θ2s |, (3) 81 where a = const> 0, and the amount is taken for all components of the θ of the set U, then the task is unambiguously resolved. For a linear equation for n = 2, the theorem is proved by the method of sequential approximations in [1]. Similarly, reasoning from [1] we are convinced that the task (1) - (2) is equivalent to the integral equation U (x) = w (x) + ∫ x1 0. . . ∫ xn 0 f (₽, u) dival. . . dmit, (4) cil = (₽1,., μn), and W (x) is a well -known function of the right parts (2). We take consecutive approaches to the solution of equation (3) in the form of up (x) = w (x) + ∫ x1 0. . . ∫ xn 0 f (₽, up -1) dival. . . dran, p = 1, 2 ,. . . , U0 ≡ 0, (5) and show that by force (3) the difference VP (x) = up+1 (x) - up (x) satisfy inequalities | VP | <Bm an - - 1kn (nkla) (p + n - 1) (p + n - 1)! where b = 2n -1, k = (l + 1) n - 1 l, l = max (x1,., xn), m = max d (| v0 |, ∣∣∣∣ ∂v0 ∂x1 ∣∣∣∣,., ∣∣∣∣ ∂v0 ∂xn ∣∣∣∣,., ∣∣∣∣ ∂n -11v0 ∂x1.. ,., ∣∣∣∣ ∂n - 11v0 ∂x2.. ) (p + n --2) (p + n - 2)! ,. . . . . . , ∣∣∣∣ ∂n -1VP ∂x2. . . ∂xn ∣∣∣∣ <bm k (nkla) p p! . 82 of these inequalities, an uniform convergence of approximations (5) follows along with their derivatives, which ensures the existence of a solution to the equation (4), therefore, a formulated problem. Its uniqueness is established by the technique standard for the consecutive approximation method. With the help of the foregoing, the issue of resolving tasks with boundary conditions obtained from (2) replacement of values ​​u (x) | XI = 0 values ​​of normal derivatives ∂U (x)/∂xi | XI = 0 can be investigated.
