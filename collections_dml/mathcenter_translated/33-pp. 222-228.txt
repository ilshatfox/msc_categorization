Verify schemes for solving one hyperbolic system of equations T. M. Khanipov Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosova, Moscow 1 Introduction to the goal of this work was a numerical solution to the next regional problem describing the operation of an RCLG generator with an ideal amplifier: {ut + vx = −α1u, vt + ux = −α2v, (1.1) v (1, t) = 0, u (0, t) + β0u (1, t) + β1u 2 (1, t) + β2u 3 (1, t) = 0, (1.2) where t> 0, x ∈ [0, 1] , αi> 0 and βj> 0 - parameters. A feature of the setting is a boundary condition for function U, connecting its values ​​at x = 0 and x = 1 at any time T. A detailed analytical study of this task is given in [1], where, in particular, the phenomenon of bufferness is considered, which consists in the ability to choose the parameters of the system so as to guarantee the existence of any pre -set number of stable cycles. The phenomenon of bufferness is relevant, for example, in connection with the modeling of memory processes and the creation of storage cells, and is of interest to study this phenomenon in numerical methods. The work proposes two different schemes: a clear and implicit, approximating task (1.1), (1.2) with the first order for temporary and spatial variables. Their stability was investigated, the implementation algorithms were considered and computational experiments were carried out. 222 T. M. Khanipov 2 The obvious scheme. Consider the following variable approximation of the system (1.1): un + 1m - unm τ + vnm - 1 h = −α1unm, m = 1, 2 ,. . . , M, vn+1m - vnm τ+unm+1 - unm h = −α2vnm, m = 0, 1,. . . - M - 1. (2.1) here τ, h> 0 - steps of the grid, respectively, according to temporary and spatial coordinates, 1/h = m - the whole, n = 0, 1,. . . By expressing in (2.1) un+1m and v n+1 m through u n m and v n m, we get the calculated formulas un+1m = u n m - τ h vnm+τ h vnm - 1 - τα1unm, m = 1, 2,. . . , M, vn+1m = v n m - τ h unm+1+τ h unm - τα2vnm, m = 0, 1 ,. . . - M - 1. (2.2) At each stage of calculations, first we find un+1m, m = 1,. . . , M, and vn+1m, m = 0, 1 ,. . . , M - 1, from (2.2), and then un+10 and v n+1 m from the condition (1.2): un+10 = β0u n+1 m - β1 (u n+1 m) 2+β2 ( u n+1 m) 3, vn+1m = 0. We explore the circuit (2.1) for stability using a spectral signs of stability (PO) [3]. To do this, put in (2.1) α1 = α2 = 0 and substitute u n m = c1λ neim pul, vnm = c2λ neim accord. Then, after the reduction on λneim pul, we get the system of linear equations relative to the coefficients C1, C2   λ λ τ τ c1 + 1 - e --i pul h c2 = 0, ei accord - 1 h c1 + λ - 1 τ c2 = 0 . It has a non -bunny solution only if its determinant is zero. We get a ratio connecting λ and wor: λ2 - 2λ+ 1 - 2 τ2 h2 (cos accord - 1) = 0, 223 on varied schemes for solving one hyperbolic. . . From here | λ | 2 = 1 + 2 τ2 h2 (1 - cos accord). The greatest value of this expression is 1 + 4τ2/h2, and it is clear that the condition the other is completed if τ = o (h2). 3 The implicit scheme Consider another variety of approximation of the system (1.1): un+1m - unm τ+vn+1m - vn+1m-1 h = −α1un+1m, m = 1,. . . , M, vn+1m - vnm τ+un+1m+1 - un+1m h = −α2vn+1m, m = 0 ,. . . , M - 1. (3.1) After simple transformations, we get the ratio un+1m (α1+1 τ)+vn+1m h - vn+1m - 1 h = unm τ, m = 1,. . . , M, vn+1m (α2+1 τ)+un+1m+1 h - un+1m h = vnm τ, m = 0 ,. . . - M - 1. (3.2) We will first solve the problem (1.1), (1.2) with β1 = β2 = 0, that is, with linear regional conditions V (1, t) = 0, u (0, t) + β0u (1, t ) = 0. (3.3) We use the firing method. To do this, at each stage of calculations, we will look for u and v in the form of u = αu0 + (1 - α) u1, v = αv0 + (1 - α) v1, (3.4) where the functions UI, VI (I = 0, 1) Satisfy (1.1) and boundary conditions VI (1, T) = 0, U0 (0, T) = 0, U1 (0, T) = 1, (3.5) A α we will select so that the condition (3.3) is fulfilled. 224 T. M. Khanipov, we describe the process of finding such UI and VI. For brevity, we denote these functions as U and V, and let ε = I. Equations (3.2), together with two equations vn+1m = 0, u n+1 0 = ε, obtained from (3.5), make up a system of 2m+2 linear equations, which is relative to the vector of unknown values ​​x = (un+10, v n+1 0,., u n+1 m, v n+1 m) t can be recorded in the form of ax = b, where the matrix a and the vector of the right part B have the form a =       1 0 0 0. . . 0 0 - 1 h α2 + 1 τ 1 h 0. . . 0 0 0 - 1 h α1 + 1 τ 1 h. . . 0 0 0 ... ... .... . . ... ... ... 0 0 0 0. . . - 1 h α1 + 1 τ 1 h 0 0 0 0. . . 0 0 1  , b = (ε, vn0 τ, un1 τ,., Unm τ, 0) t. Matrix A is a three -dyagonal, and to solve the AX = B system, you can use the LU method [4]. Since the elements of the matrix depend only on the parameters of αi, h and τ, it is enough to decompose it once before the calculation cycle. After the two solutions are U0, V0 and U1, we find α. To do this, we substitute the expression (3.4) in the boundary condition (3.3). We receive taking into account (3.5) α = 1 + β0u1 (1, t) β0 (U1 (1, t) - u0 (1, t)) + 1. So, we know how to solve the problem (1.1), (3.3). Task (1.1), (
