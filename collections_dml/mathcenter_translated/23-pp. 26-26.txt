A set A is Q-reducible to a set B, denoted by A ≤ QB, if there is a computable function f such that  (∀x) ( x ∈ A ⇔ Wf(x) ⊆ B  ) .  If, in addition,  (∀x) (∀y) ( x 6= y ⇒ Wf(x) ∩Wf(y) = ∅  ) ,  then A is Q1-reducible to B. It is well-known [2] that a computable enumerable set A is Q-complete if  and only if A is Q1-complete. For ∆02 sets we have the following results.  Theorem 1. Let A be in ∆02 and K be a creative set. Then K ≤ QA if and only if K ≤ Q1A.  A set A is s-reducible to a set B, denoted by A ≤ sB, if there is a computable function g such that  (∀x) ( x ∈ A ⇔ Wg(x) ∩B 6= ∅  ) .  Corollary (Omanadze R., Sorbi A.). Let A be in ∆02 and K ≤ sA. Then A is not hyperhyperimmune.  Theorem 2. Let a coinfinite set A be in ∆02. Then A is not hyperhyperimmune if and only if there is an infinite subset C of A with C ∈ ∆02 such that for every infinite subset C1 of C we have K ≤ sC1.  Theorem 3. Let A be a coinfinite not finitely strongly hyperimmune set. Then there is an infinite subset C of A such that for every infinite subset C1 of C we have K ≤ sC1.  R E F E R E N C E S 1. Soare R. I.
