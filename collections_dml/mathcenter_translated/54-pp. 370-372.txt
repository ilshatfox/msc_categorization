Materials of the International School-Conference of UDC 517.5 The best polynomial approaches of periodic functions that have a derivative in the sense of Weil K. Tukhliev1 1 kamaridin.t54@mail.ru; Khujand State University named after B. Gafurov found accurate inequalities between the best approaches of the periodic differentiated functions in the sense of trigonometric polynomials and the generalized module of the continuity of the Might Order. Keywords: a derivative in the sense of Weil, the best approaches, the function of Steklov, the module of continuity of the Mojor. The results obtained in this work are associated with the definition of a fractional derivative in the sense of Weil [1]. Let l2: = l2 [0.2π]-the space of material 2π-periodic functions F. Consider for the function f ∈ L2 with a number of Fourier f (x) = a0 2 + φ∑ k = 1 (ak (f) coskx + bk (f) sinkx), a derivative of the order α≥ 0 in the sense of Weil, determined by equality F (α ) (x) = φ∑ k = 1 kα {ak cos (kx + απ 2) + bk sin (kx + απ 2)}. Everywhere further n, r+: = (0,+ ∞), - sets of all natural and positive real numbers, respectively. Through l (α) 2 (α ≥ 0, l (0) 2 ≡ l2), we denote the multiplicity of functions f ∈ L2, in which there is a derivative in the sense of Weil F (α) ∈ L2 (α≥ 0). If SN -1 (F (α), X) (α≥ 0) is a partial amount of the order of n -1 of the Fourier of the function F (α), then it is easy to prove that the best approximation of the function f (α) ∈ L2 TN - TN - TN - TN- 1 degree no higher than N -1 has the type EN -1 (F (α)) = Inf {∥ f (α) –TN -1∥: tn -1 ∈ℑ2N -1} = ∥ F (α) - SN -1 (f (α) ∥ = (φ∑ k = n k2αρ2k (f)) 1/2, where ρ2 k (f) = a2 k (f)+b2 k (f), ak (f), bk (f) )- cosine and sinus-coefficients of function f. Let ωm (f; t) de f = sup {∥∥∆mh (f; ·) ∥∥: 0 <h ≤ t} The function that we will call as a generalized modulus of the continuity of the order of the order f ∈ L2, determined through the functions of the glass (see. , for example [2]). Everywhere, then we think sinc t: = {sin t t, if t ̸ = 0, 1, if t = 0}. K. Tukhliev 371 Lemma. For an arbitrary function F ∈ L (α) 2, the following equality ω2M (F (α), t) = SUP {ux k = 1 k2αρ2k (1– SINC KH) 2M: | H | H | H | HUP ( ≤ t}. We introduce the extreme characteristic χn, α, p (ωm, q, h) = sup f ∈L (α) 2 F ̸ = const EN -1 (F)  ĥ 0 ω p m (α), T ) Q (t) d t   −1/p, where m, n ∈N, α≥ 0, p ∈R+, 0 <h ≤π/n, Q ≥ 0 - weight function on the segment [0, h] . Using lemma, the following general statement can be proved: theorem 1. Letm ∈N, α≥ 0, 0 <p ≤ 2, 0 <h ≤π/n, n ∈ N, Q - the weight function on the segment [0, H]. Then the inequalities {an, m, α, p (q, h) −1 ≤χn, α, p (ωm, q, h) ≤ {inf n≤k <imes ak, m, α, p (q, p (q, p (q, q, p (q, q, q, p (q, q, q, q, q, h)} −1, (1) where ak, m, α, p (q, h) =  kαp ĥ 0 (1 - sinc kt) mp q (t) d t  1/p, k ≥ N. A natural question arises: to find out cases or indicate the specific properties of weight functions, for which, with all 0 <h ≤π/n, the equality of Inf K≥n ak, M, R, P (Сory, H) = an, M, R, R, Rules occur p (gment, h), (2) equivalent to the task of accuracy of bilateral inequality (1). Theorem 2. Let q - the weight function on the segment [0, h] (0 <h ≤π/n, n purpose) is differentiated. If, with some α ∈R+, α≥ 1, 1/α≤ p ≤ 2 and any t ∈ (0, H), differential inequality (αp −1) q (t) - t q ≥ 0, is true The ratio (2) and, therefore, χn, α, p (ωm, q, h) = 1 nα  ĥ ĥ 0 (1 - sinc nt) mp q (t) d t   −1/p. It should be noted that a number of extreme tasks of the theory of approximation related to the concept of a fractional derivative in the sense of Weil were previously considered in the works [3; 4] and others. 372 Materials of the International School-Conference Literature 1.
