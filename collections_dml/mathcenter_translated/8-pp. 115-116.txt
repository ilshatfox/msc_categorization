) The mixed reverse edge task for the sliding profile of the wing of the screen of the screen is devoted to the development of the method of aerodynamic design of the wing profile, sliding with its rear edge along the straightforward screen. Part of the contour of the profile is a rectilinear segment, and on the remaining part, the distribution of speed is set depending on the arc abscissa. It is believed that the fluid in which the movement occurs is ideal and inconsistent. The mathematically considered task is to mixed 115 of the marginal task for the analytical in the upper half -fluidity of IMW> 0 (W = ∗+iψ - the complex current potential) of the function χ = i ln dw/dz. The analytical solution is explicitly using the Signorini formula. In order for sections of the screen lying in front of the profile and behind it to be located on one straight line, a study of the behavior of the DZ/DW function at infinity is carried out. As a result, a condition was obtained that ensures the absence of vertical offset of the profile contour and allows you to look for the length of its straight area. The built solution is implemented numerically. Based on the results of the calculations, the effect of the angle of inclination of the rectilinear area and the size of the maximum speed on the profile on its aerodynamic characteristics was investigated. The work was supported by the RFFF (projects N 99-01–00365, 99-0104029), the program “Universities of Russia” and the ANT Foundation. Yu. A. Ilyushin (Samara) The task ∆2 for one equation of a hyperbolic type with a continuous coefficient Consider the equation uxy - λf (y) u = 0 (1) on the set G = G - ∪g+, where g - = {(X, y) | - h <x <0, - x <y <h}, g+ = {(x, y) | 0 <x <h, 0 <y <h - x}. The task is ∆2.
