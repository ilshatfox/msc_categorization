Sufficient conditions for the completeness of the exponential system in convex areas A.F. Kuzhaev1 1 arsenkuzh@outlook.com; Bashkir State University provides sufficient conditions for the completeness of the system of exponential monomas in convex areas. This result is a generalization of the classical statement obtained independently by A.F. Leontyev and B.Ya. Levin, in case of indicators that do not have a density. It was found that weakening the measurability of the sequence (that is, the existence of density) in the context of the above result of completeness is the equality of the upper and maximum densities. Key words: sequence density, whole function, completeness, convex region. Let λ = {λk, nk} ger = 1 - a multiple sequence of positive numbers. Here {λk} φ k = 1 is an unlimited strictly increasing sequence of sexual numbers, and NK is a natural number called the multiplicity of the element λk, k ∈N. Recall that the upper density and maximum density respectively is the following characteristics of the sequence λ: n̄ (λ): = lim t →+nder 1 t ∑ λkét nk, n̄0 (λ): = lim Δ → 0+lim t →+φ 1 Δt ∑ t (1–af) <λkét nk. According to [1, §e3, ch. IV] The limit for Δ → 0+ always exists, so the maximum density is determined correctly. In the case of the limit, n (λ): = lim t →+و 1 t ∑ λkét nk The sequence λ is called measurable, and this limit is simply density. If the sequence λ is measurable, then the upper and maximum density for it coat and equal density [2, Lemma 2.1]. We will be interested in the case when the upper and maximum density coincide, but the sequence is not measurable. Many such sequences are non -notorious that it demonstrates the following example. Let 0 <rk → → → ∞, and rk+1/rk → °, k → urb. We put λ = ⋃ k organo, where λk is a lot, consisting of all natural numbers belonging to the interval (r2k; r2k+1), k ∈ N, the frequency of each of which is equal to one. We put for brevity n (t, λ) = ∑ λkét nk. 66 Materials of the Youth School-Conference, due to the choice of numbers RK, we have: n̄ (λ) = lim t →+ger n (t, λ) t ê lim k → ger n (r2k+1, λ) R2k+1 ê lim K → Φ r2k+1 —r2k r2k+1 = 1. Let Δ ∈ (0; 1). Denote n̄0 (λ, δ) = lim t →+φ n (t, λ) −n (t (1–δ), λ) δt. Then n̄0 (λ, δ) = lim k → φ n (r2k+1, λ) −n (r2k+1 (1–af), λ) δr2k+1 = lim k → ⇒ δr2k+1 δr2k+1 = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1 = 1 . From here, taking into account the previous one according to [3, lemma 1] we get: n̄0 (λ) = n̄ (λ). At the same time, we have: lim t →+φ n (t, λ) t = lim k → φ n (r2k, λ) r2k é lim k → φ r2k - 1 r2k = 0. Thus, the sequence λ does not have a density . Let the producing convex area of ​​complex plate. The vertical diameter of the region will be called the following value: D (G): = SUP X Sup Z1, Z2g {| Y1 - Y2 | : z1 = x + i y1, z2 = x + i y2, z1, z2 ∈G, x ∈R}. Through KG (∗) we will denote the supporting function of the convex region G ([4, p. 43]), we put E (λ) = {zl eλk z} °, nk -1 k = 1, l = 0. We will say that the system of functions E (λ) Pop on in the convex region G if it is full in the space of functions that analytical in the region with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsurrents of ISG. The next statement is generalized by the classic result of Levinaleontiev, which was obtained by them independently of each other ([5, p. 286], [4, p. 122]). Theorem. Let n̄ (λ) = n̄0 (λ) = τ <mm. Then the system (λ) is full in any area G, for which the condition KG (−π 2) +KG (π 2) = D (G) é 2πτ is met, and is incomplete in any area with a vertical diameter D (G)> 2πτ. Literature 1.

Kuzhaev We Give Some Sufficient Conditions for the CompleTens of the System of Exponential Monomials in Convex Domains.
