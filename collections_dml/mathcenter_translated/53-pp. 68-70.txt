The method of finding the optimal regression equation we consider multidimensional data, where for ∀yj there is a set of variables XJI, J = 1, M, I = 1, N: Y X1 X2 ... XN Y1 X12 ... X1N Y2 X21 X22 ... X2N ... ... ... ... ... ... ym xm1 xm2 ... XMN R.A. Galyamov, M. M. Minegaliev 69 assumes that Y does not depend on all X1, X2, ... , xn, and from some subset a ⊂ {x1, x2, ..., xn}, and the subset of A is unknown and the dependence of the non -linear. The work considers the method of finding this dependence. In the regression analysis, two models are most often considered among all models: 1. multiplier y = β0x β1 ... x βk ik, (1) 2. Additative y = β0 + β1xi1 + ... + βKXIK, (2) classes are studied models lying between (1) and (2): yλ = β0 + βi1xλ, i1 + ... + βikxλ, ik, (3) where yλ = fλ (y) and xλ, i = fλ (XI): fλ (fift z) = ln eλz -1 λ. We believe that y is addicted to X by formula (3). The solution to this problem is using the maximum credibility method. The function of credibility has the form: l (β, λ, σ, a) = 1 (√ 2πσ) m e - (yλ --βxλ, a) 2 2σ2 where yλ, j = fλ (yj), yλ = (yλ, 1,. ., yλ, m), xλ, a is a matrix that is from the elements xλ, ji, 1 6 j 6 m, i ∈ A, xλ, j0 = 1, such as xλ, ji = fλ (xji), Vector β = (β0, β1,., βk). We find the values ​​β and σ such that the function l (β, λ, σ, a) is maximum. After the substitution of these values, we get: l ∗ (β, λ, a) = 1 (√ 2π) m ((y - (x ′ λ, a xλ, a) −1x ′a yxλ, a) 2 m) m 2 e - m 2. 70 P. O. Gafurov So, our method is as follows: we find a lot of a and λ so that the confidence interval βi does not contain 0, and the average quadratic error (y - (x ′ λ, a xλ, a) −1x ′ λ , A yxλ, a) 2 m was the smallest. Then the set of a and λ and β = (x′λ, axλ, a) −1x′λ, ay are the optimal parameters in the equation (3) in the sense that they maximize the function of credibility in the assumption that trust intervals are not equal zero. The proposed methods are illustrated by example. Other Fift functions when optimizing the equation yλ = β0 + β1xλ, 1 + ... + βnxλ, n, are considered in [1]. L and T R A T R A 1. Aivazyans.A.
