The solvability of the regional tasks for the stationary equation of the Schrödinger when changing the coefficient C (X) is devoted to the study of the behavior of unlimited solutions to the stationary equation of the Schrödinger LU ≡ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ (x) u = 0, (1) where c (x) is a smooth non -negative function, On an uncompromal diversity, M when changing the coefficient C (X). Let M - arbitrary smooth coherent non -membranous Rimano diversity without a edge, {bk} gerk = 1 - exhaustion of diversity m with smooth boundaries ∂bk, b ⊂ m - an arbitrary coherent compact subsets with a smooth border, not empty insides and b ⊂ bk for 97 All K. In [1], a sufficiently new approach was proposed to setting marginal tasks on non -membranous Riman varieties, based on the introduction of the concept of class [f] equivalent on the variety of Montless limited functions. In this work, a generalization of this approach is proposed for the case of unlimited continuous functions F. Let F1 (x) and F2 (x) - continuous non -negative on m functions (limited or unlimited). We will say that the functions F1 (X) and F2 (X) are equivalent to m and denote f1 (x) ∼ f2 (x), if for some exhaustion {bk} ger = 1 variety M, limk → → → → → \ BK | F1 (x) - f2 (x) | = 0. The variety of M will be called L-strip of diversity if the M \ B has a solution to the equation (1), such that v | ∂b = 1 and v ∼ 0. Next with equation (1), consider the equation L1u ≡ ∆U - c1 (x) u = 0, (2) where 0 ≤ c1 (x) ≤ c (x), c1 (x) - smooth function. Theorem. Let on the L-string of diversity M for equations LU = 0 and ∆U = 0 on m \ b are solved external marginal tasks with boundary conditions from class [F]. Then on M \ B solve the external marginal task for the equation L1u = 0 with boundary conditions from class [F]. The work was supported by the RFFI (project No. 03-01-00304 a). L and T R A T R A 1.
