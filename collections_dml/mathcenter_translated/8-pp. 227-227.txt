The functions of the Mittag -Lofler and Bessel we found that the function of the Mittag -Luffler Eρ (z; α) = φ∑ n = 0 zn γ (α + n/ρ), ρ> 0, satisfies the equation in private derivatives Z ∂2u ∂z ∂α + ρ2 ∂u ∂ρ = 0. (1) found by the method of separation of variables the function uρ (z; α) = φ∑ n = 0 cnφ (α + n/ρ) z n, (2) will be a solution to equation (1) Under appropriate conditions for coefficients CN and function φ (t). With φ (t) = 1/γ (t), the function (2) satisfies both the equation (1) and the differential -strip equation z d dz uρ (z; α + 1) + αρu (z; α) = uρ (z; α). (3) in particular, subject to Duρ (z; α)/dz = uρ (z; α + 1) the equation (3) is reduced to the differential equation Z D2 DZ2 Uρ (z; α) + αρ d dz uve (z; α) = uρ (z; α), which can be transformed into the Best equation. The continuial analogue of the solution (2) of equations (1) is the function represented by the stiltyes integral: uρ (z; α) = ∫ b a c (t) φ (1 + t/ρ) ztdσ (t). Such integral representations under certain conditions on φ (t) and σ (t) are studied.
