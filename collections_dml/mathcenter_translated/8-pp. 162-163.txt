Conformal displays of circular polygons let the limited single -link area B are given in a complex W -plaque, different from the circle. The boundary of the region B consists of the final number of arcs of concentric circles and the final number of segments lying on the rays emerging from the center of circles. The center of circles coincides with the beginning of the coordinates and belongs to the region. Region B, generally speaking, is not starry relative to the beginning of the coordinates. In the work, a differential equation was obtained regarding the function displaying a single circle to the region B. The resulting differential equation contains unknown constant, which are not directly determined by the form of the region B. We note that the areas under consideration are a special case of circular polygons, for which the corresponding differential equation relative to the displaying function, it known as the differential equation of Schwartz, 162 has a more complex appearance.
