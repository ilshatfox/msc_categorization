Interpolation by binary basic splashes S.F. Lukomsky1, M.D. Mushko2 1 lukomskiisf@info.sgu.ru; Saratov National Research State University 2 dart-maximus@yandex.ru; The Saratov National Research State University considers a new class of basic scales, which are two -time integrating Walsha's function. The formulas for constructing the interpolation sparrow on a uniform grid are given, the value of the deviation of the splan from the interpoled function is indicated. It is proved that the built basic splan is a solution to the scaling equation. Keywords: binary basic splashes, interpolation, scaling equalnulation. Let I f (x) = xy 0 f (t) d t (x ∈ [0.1]) - the integration operator, rn (t) = signsin2n t - the functions of the rademacher, w2n -1 (x) = n --1∏ k = 0 rk (x) - Walsha functions. Determination 1. Function ∗ (x) = (4i) 2W3 (x) (x ∈ [0.1]) will be called binary basic splash of the 2nd degree. It is obvious that wor (x) is a piece-monotonous function that coincides with the polynomial of the 2nd degree on each segment [k 4, k+1 4] (k = 0.1,2,3). Determination 2. We denote through q (n) 2 the set of pieces of 2nd degree, having continuous derivatives on the segment [0, N4], N ≥ 4, and which on each segment [K 4, K+1 4] coincide With some polynomial of the second degree. Theorem 1. For all x ∈R, the equality of ∈ n Photu wor (x + n 4) = 2 are true; ∑ n] International School-Conference Baside Splain ng (X4) satisfies the scalable equation. Theorem 3. Designate F (x) = ∗ (x4). Equality F (x) = 1 4 f (2x)+ 1 2 f (2x −1)+ 1 2 f (2x −2)+ 1 2 f (2x −3)+ 1 4 f (2x −4) is true. With fixed n ∈ N, N ≥ 4, determine the function onic (x): = ∗ (n x x). For her, supp pul = [0, 4n], onic (n) is the polynomial of the 2nd degree on each segment [i-1 n, i n], onic ′ (0) = onic (2 n) = ship (4 n ) = 0, ∗ ′ (1 n) = n, ship (3 n) = −n. Consider the following interpolation task. Let F (x) is continuous on [0.1], xk = kn (k = 0, n) - uniform mesh on [0.1]. Through s (x) we denote the 2nd degree interpolation splash, coinciding with F (x) in the XK nodes, which we will build as follows: the -1st step. Let m0 ∈R arbitrary. We believe S -1 (x) = −M0N ther (x + 3n). In this case, S sum - 1 (0) = m0. 0-shag. We determine the S0 (x) equality of S0 (x) = S -1 (x)+onic (x - 2 n) (F (0 n) −S -1 (0 n)). In this case, s0 (0) = f (0), s’s (0) = m0. K-th step. (1 ≤ k ≤ n) sk (x) = sk -1 (x)+2 accord (x - k −1 n) (f (k n) —sk -1 (k n)). After the k-th step, sk (j n) = f (j n), (j = 1.2,.., K). Finally, we believe s (x) = sn (x). Obviously, s (x) interpreases the function f (x) in the nodes xk = kn (k = 0.1,., N) and s ′ (0) = m0. To evaluate the error of interpolation, we determine the function ψk (x) = f (xk -1 +x) +f (xk - 2 +x) +· · +(−1) k - 1 f (x0 +x), x ∈ [ 0, 1 n]; k = 1, n. Theorem 4. Choosem0 = 2h (f (x1) - f (x0)) and let h = xk - xk - 1. Then for x ∈ [xk -1, xk] (k = 1, n) inequality | s (x) - f (x) | ≤ω (h, ψk - 1)+ω (h, ψk)+ω (h, f).

Lykov1 1 alkv@list.ru; Samara National Research University named after Academician S.P. The Queen describes the connection between interpolation and extrapolation structures. It is shown that for a certain class of interpolation spaces obtained by the K -method of material interpolation, there is also an extrapolation description obtained by the replacement in the interpolation structure of the functionality with a parameterized set of accurate interpolation spaces with characteristic functions Tθ, θ ∈ (0.1) (in particular, on a set of spaces of Peter). Keywords: interpolation space, interpolation function, extrapolation space, Peter's spaces, material interpolation method. Suppose that a⃗ = (a0, a1) is a pair of banakhov, i.e. Such a pair of banana spaces that for some Hausdorfovs of the topological space T, continuous investments A0 ⊂ T and A1 ⊂ T. Then for any element x ∈ T, represented in the form of x = x0 + x
