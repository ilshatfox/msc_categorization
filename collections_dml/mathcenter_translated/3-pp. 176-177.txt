One assessment of twisted, generated by the permeable wall of the f.R. Gainulnn, V.L. Fedyaev Institute of Mechanics and Engineering of the KNC RAS, Kazan Ilgatov@Sci. KCN. R and the non -stationary and stationary course of the ideal inconspicuous fluid in the channel containing a thin permeable wall are considered. It is assumed that in front of the wall the movement of the liquid is potential, behind it is vortex. In the non -stationary case, it is additionally believed that at the initial moment of time the liquid rests. Subject to quasistacency, the current at the beginning of the acceleration - + pressure P and P on different sides of the walls are using the Bernoulli integral: at the same time (1) here ~ - - the coefficient of resistance, W is the rate of flow, p the density of the liquid. We believe, in addition to the fact that behind the wall the tangent component of the speed is small, and in front of it Du - = kw dt '(2) where t, and - tangent coordinate and fluid velocity, k = s*/ln, s* = s1/s0 • S1 - openings area, s0 - wall skeleton area, LN characteristic distance by normal. Considering further that K, ~. LR0 = P0 - P0 - constant (medium values), from (1) and (2) we will find D 2. Y, w2! -(-(LR0 ---)) 2 = KW. DT P 2 (3) OSR, taking into account the ratings of LN and LR0 for the speed of flow and twist on the wall, we get w = ricost*'(j) = xsint*' where t*= tta.t/l, x = tt <; * f.* v / f., f.* = f. 01 f., A. = s* /lne, l;;;* = .jl ;; 0 /l ;;, Ri = ~ • E • V, E - wall length, f. 0 - its projection, l;;; 0 - the average value of the resistance coefficient, V is the velocity of the liquid at the input to the channel, 176 E- parameter characterizing the attenuation of the velocity in front of the wall. In the inpatient case, behind the wall, the pressure p- is estimated by - + (v) p = r - p 2 + wq>, (4) where Q> is the current function. (5) To find W, the equation dw 'u2 -jwd- ~ w =-. d't o 2 (6) Orsye after a series of simplifications for assessing the speed of leakage, we find expression (7) where 0 = 't /a, a - coordinate one of the edges of the wall, CR = 0.5 ~ O, y = ~ A2 /Q ( 1 - CR), O = (1+ CR) (Q/A - 0.5), ~ - parameter that characterizes the tangent of the fluid velocity in front of the wall, determined from the task of the flow of the impenetrable wall, Q is the fluid consumption through the wall: Q - fluid consumption, E = (4s / + S1S2 + S1S - 2S (l -cr) sin 2 q>) / 8s1s 2 • Here S is the channel section at the output, S1, S2 - areas corresponding to the opening and wall, Q> - the angle of inclination to The axis of the channel. From (7) it follows (j) =.!. (U+ Ocrea-I). And the obtained estimates of the rate of flow and twisting can be used further as initial approaches in numerical calculations of the flows under consideration. 177
