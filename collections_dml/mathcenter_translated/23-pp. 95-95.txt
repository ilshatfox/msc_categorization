The solvability of the regional tasks for the stationary equation of the Schrödinger when changing the coefficient C (X) is devoted to the study of the behavior of unlimited solutions to the stationary equation of the Schrödinger LU ≡ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆ (x) u = 0, (1) where c (x) is a smooth non -negative function, On an uncompromal diversity, M when changing the coefficient C (X). Let M - arbitrary smooth coherent non -membranous Rimano diversity without a edge, {bk} gerk = 1 - exhaustion of diversity m with smooth boundaries ∂bk, b ⊂ m - an arbitrary coherent compact subsets with a smooth border, not empty insides and b ⊂ bk for 97
