One scheme for constructing the correct expansion of the differential operator E. N. Isaev Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky issues of the general theory of boundary tasks were discussed in the labor of M.I. Vishika, L. Hurmander, A.A. Dezin and other authors. These issues are directly related to the concept of right extensions of differential operations. In these Ra Bots, in particular, the existence of correct tasks and correct extensions was proved. It is of interest in the structure of structural schemes of the correct extensions of the differential operations. This work discusses one of the approaches associated with the method of orthogonal television, different from the approach considered by A. As an example of the application of this scheme, we consider 114 the task of constructing the correct extensions for ordinary differential operations with constant coefficients of the order n: p (d dx) = n∑ i = 1 ai di dxi, an 6 = 0. In particular, it is shown, shows that it is shown that any correct task that meets the correct expansion of the differential operation p (d dx) can be formulated as follows: p (dx) u (x) = f (x), f ∈ L2 (ω), x ∈ ω, ∫ Ω u (x) ek (x) dx = ∫ ω qk (x) f (x), where qk is the solution of the equation p ∗ (∂) qk (x) = ek (x), k = 1,. . . , N, {e1 (x) ,. . . , en (x)} - orthonormated nucleus base. Using the method of orthogonal design, we will write down the solution of this problem in this way: u (x) = n∑ k = 1 (f, onic) λk p ∗ (∂) onic + n∑ k = 1 eλkx ∫ ω qk (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f (x) f ( ) DX, where {inous} is an orthogonal normalized system of its own vectors that meet their own values ​​{λk}. The work discusses examples of specific boundary tasks and the lines of calculating the coefficients of QK (x). The author expresses gratitude to A.V. Kalinin for help in writing work.
