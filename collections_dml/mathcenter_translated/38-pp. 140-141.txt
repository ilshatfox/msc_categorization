One task of the theory of elasticity for the composite wedge flat-shared elastic wedge, consisting of two homogeneous-izotropic wedge-shaped regions about ~ e ~ a and-[3 ~ in :::;;; O (o :::;;;; r <oo) (with elastic modules in the es of <1>, e (2) and coeffit ~ by the Poisson V (L) and V <2> respectively), is in equilibrium. The top of the composite wedge is fixed, rotation at the point with the coordinates B = o, r = RO (R0> O) is absent. On the beam B = o set the conditions of smooth contact. The first main task of the theory of elasticity is considered. The boundary conditions are specified in the form of sedate rows with the blessed radii of convergence. The solution of the problem is searched in the form of steppe rows 00 00 $ l (r, c) = l l ~> (e) rn, a ~ j) (r, b) = .l: in $/> (b) rn, rn, n = o n = o 00 00 t; ~) (r, c) = l with $!> (b) rn 'u <l (r, c) = l d $/> ({j) rp, n = o n = o 00 v <l (r, c) = l fjj) (o) rn, j = [1, 2], (1) n = o where l ~> (e), in ~), (c), C, V> (E), D ~) (B), F ~ L (O) - unknown functions.

Further, the task comes down to solving a system consisting of eight linear equi and eight unknown. A study of the system is carried out, it is shown that the resulting steppe rows have a bored radius of convergence. At the last stage, specific examples are considered when the given functions are polynomas or whole functions (E ± r, sin r, cos r, etc.). Literature 1. Ufland I. S.
