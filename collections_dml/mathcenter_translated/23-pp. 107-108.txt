One redefined system of the second order with a super -syluclaric point, let D - rectangle, d = {0 <x <δ1, 0 <y <δ2}. Next, we denote γ1 = {y = 0, 0 <x <δ1}, γ2 = {x = 0, 0 <y <Δ2}. In the area D, consider the UXY + system (AJ (X, Y)/R αJ) ux + (bj (x, y)/r βj) uy + (cj (x, y)/r αj + βj) u = = fj (x, y)/r αj + βj, (1) where r2 = x2 + y2, aj (x, y), bj (x, y), cj (x, y), fj (x, y) - specified The functions of the region D, βj are integers, j = 1, 2. The study of differential equations and systems with singular and ultra -orgular coefficients is devoted to a lot of work. In this message, on the basis of a method developed by N. Rajabov, a representation of the variety of system solutions (1) was obtained. In the future, we denote the class of functions through C2 (D), which have continuous derivatives of the first order in D and such that uxy ∈ C (D). The theorem has been proven. Let in the system of equations (1) for αj = 2, βj> 2, j = 1, 2, coefficients and right parts satisfy the following conditions: 1) a1 (x, y) ∈ C ′ (D), B1 (X, B1 (X, B1 (X, B1 (X, B1 (x, y), c1 (x, y), f1 (x, y) ∈ C (D); 109 b2 (x, y) ∈ C ′ Y (D), A2 (X, Y), C2 (X, Y), F2 (X, Y) ∈ C (D); 2) c1 (x, y) = r 2+ β1∂x (a1 (x, y)/r 2)+ a1 (x, y) b1 (x, y), c2 (x, y) = r 2+ β2∂y (b2 (x, y)/r β2) + a2 (x, y) b2 (x, y); 3) | aj (x, y) - aj (0, 0) | ≤ hjrαk, hj = const, αk> 1, k = 3, 4; j = 1, 2, | b1 (x, y) - b1 (0, 0) | ≤ h3rβ3, h3 = const, β3> β - 1, | b2 (x, 0) - b2 (0, 0) | ≤ h4xν1, h4 = const, ν1> β2 - 1; 4) ∂x (a1 (x, y)/r 2) = ∂y (b2 (x, y)/r β2) in D; 5) A1 (0, 0) <0, B1 (0, 0)> 0, A2 (0, 0)> 0; 6) f̃1 (x, y) = f1 (x, y) exp [b1 (0, 0) ω (1) β1/2–1 (x, y)] = o (r ν2), ν2> β1 + 1 ; 7) functions F1 (X, Y) and F2 (X, Y) are connected using the system coefficients in explicit form; 8) f̃1 (x) = f1 (x) exp [−b2 (0, 0) ωβ2−1 (x)] = o (xγ1), γ1> β1 - 1. Then any solution of the system (1) from class C2 ( D) is represented in the form of u (x, y) = exp [–ω2a1 (x, y) - (a1 (0, 0)/x) arctg (y/x)] ω (∗1 (x), ψ1 (y) , f1 (x, y)), ∗1 (x) = k (c1, f1 (x)), ψ1 (y) = g1 (y)/y 2, where ω (ng (x), ψ1 (y), F1 (x, y)), k (c1, f1 (x)) - well -known integral operators, f1 (x), g1 (y), ω2a1 (x, y), ω β2 b2 (x, 0), ω β1 B1 (X, Y) are written through the coefficients of the system in explicitly, C1 is an arbitrary constant. At the same time, lim x → 0 [lim y → 0 u (x, y)] = {0, if b2 (0, 0) <0, o (Exp [b2 (0, 0) ωβ2−1 (x)])) , if b2 (0, 0)> 0, u (x, y) = O (exp [–A1 (0, 0)/x) arctg (y/x)]), with x → 0. E.I. I. I. I. I.
