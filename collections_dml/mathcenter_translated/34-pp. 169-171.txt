Potentials for one degenerating elliptical equation of the second kind of A. M. Nigmedzyanov Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University, Kazan, Aigmani@yandex.ru, Aigmani@rambler.ru Let E+P-The Semi-Mespace XP> 0 P-Minut Euclide points x = (x ′, xp), x ′ = (x1, x2,., XP -1), D - the final area in E+P, limited by the open part γ0 hyperploster XP = 0 and hyperpoor γ. In E + P, consider the degenerate elliptical equal Em [u (x)] = p - 1∑ j = 1 ∂2u ∂x2j + xmp ∂2u ∂x2p = 0, (1) where m> 4, p> 3. C by using the fundamental solution E (ă, x) equations (1) [1], we form the surface potentials of the type of simple and double layers: V (x) = ∫ γ µ (₽) e (₽, x) dγ, W (x) = ∫ Γ ν (₽) am [e (ă, x)] dγ, where am [] = ă p p - 1∑ j = 1 cos (n, ăj) ∂ ∂acy + cos (n, tip) ∂ ∂ Answers, A µ (cil) and ν (cil) - continuous functions on γ. Lemma 1. If γ is the surface of Lipunov, which forms with hyperploster XP = 0 right angle, then ∫ γ | am [e (ă, x)] | dγ 6 b, 171 where B is constant. Lemma 2 (gellestedta) If γ is the surface of Lipunov, orthogonal hyperploster XP = 0, then ∫ γ am [e (ă, x)] dγ =     i (x) - 1, if x ∈ D; I (x) - 1/2, if x ∈ γ; I (x), if x ∈ E+p \ d = de, where i (x) = - ∫ γ0 am [e (ă ′, x)] dă. Theorem 1. Let γ - the surface of Lipunov, forming with hyperploster XP = 0 right angle. Then, with ν ∈ C (γ), the limiting ratios of wi (x0) = - ν0 2 + w̃ (x0), we (x0) = ν0 2 + w̃ (x0), where wi (x0) and we (x0) - The limit values ​​of the potential W (x) at the point x0 ∈ γ for x → x0, respectively, from the inside and from the outside of the border γ, and w̃ (x0) - the direct value of the potential W (x) at point x0 ∈ γ. Theorem 2. Let the surface of Lipunov γ form with hyperploster XP = 0 right angle, density µ ∈ C (γ). Then the potential of the type of simple layer V (x) is continuous in E+P. Theorem 3. Let γ - the surface of Lipunov, forming with hyperploster XP = 0 right angle, and µ ∈ C (γ). Then the amendments are the limiting ratios AMX0 [V (X0)] I = µ0 2 + ˜amx0 [v (x0)], lim x → x0 amx0 [v (x0)] e = - µ0 2 + ˜amx0 [v (x0)]] where amx0 [v (x0)] i and amx0 [v (x0)] e are the limit values ​​to the normal derivative potential of the type of simple layer at 172 point x0 γ ˜amx0 [v (x0)] - direct value of the connormal derivative potential of the type of simple layer.

Kant, Kaliningrad, olga_omelyan2002@mail.ru In the n-dimensional space PN, we will continue to carry out the distribution of the NSN M-somer PM PM. In [1], a compositional equipment of the NSN distribution was carried out, consisting in the connection to each plane of the distribution of analogues of the plane of the CN -M -1 plane and the normal of the 2nd kind of Norden NM -1. Compositional equipment is set by the Quasithensor field λ = {λi, λia, λa}. Indexes accept the following values: i, j = 1 ,. . . , n; I = 1 ,. . . , m; A = m+ 1 ,. . . , n. We introduce into consideration the tensor t = {tij, tiaj, tai}, called the tensor of non -special displacements (see [1]), which contains a number of shades. The covariant derivatives of ∇jλ equipping quasitenzor λ are expressed using the component of the object of group connectedness γ and form a tensor containing similar shades. 173
