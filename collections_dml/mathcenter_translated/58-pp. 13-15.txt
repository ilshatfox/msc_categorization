The convergence of the collocation method for one class of fractional-radio equations of Yu.R. Agachev1, A.V. Guskova2 1 jagachev@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University 2 Anyshkaflower@gmail.com; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in the work investigates the convergence of the method of collocation of solving the Koshi type problem for the differential equation with the fractional derivative of Rieman-Liwill in the main part and the coefficients from the space of the Lebag. Keywords: the space of the label, the differential equation, the fractional derivative, the task of the Koshi type, the method of collocation, the convergence of the method, let m ∈N and p, α ∈R: p ≥ 1, m −1 <α≤ m. The task of the type of koshi is considered (dα - k - 1a+ x) (a) = 0, k = 0, m −1, (1) for the differential equation of the fractional order of the species (dαa+ x) (t)+ m∑ k = 1 gk (t) (d α --k a+ x) (t) = y (t), − music <a <t ≤ b <+ φ, (2) where the functions are GK (t), k = 1, m, y ( t) - known, x (t) - desired, defined on [a, b]; (DβA+x) (t) - left -sided derivative of the Riemann - Liwill of the order β of function x (t) (see, e.g., [4, p. 44]). Suppose that the well -known functions are GK (t), k = 1, m, y (t) - continuous and as a space of the right parts we take LP ≡ lp (a, b), 1 ≤ p ≤ φ - the space of functions integrated according to the Lebeg on [a, b] with a degree p, with the norm ∥z∥p = {b∫ a | z (t) | p d t} 1/p, z ∈ LP. As a space of the desired elements, we choose X = IαA+(LP) - the space of functions f (t), represented in the form of a left -sided fractional integral of the Riman -Lyuville order α from the function from LP with the corresponding norm in Y: ∥x∥x = ∥x∥p +∥iαA+x∥p, x ∈ X. 14 “Lobachev readings - 2019” through YN we will denote the space of HN algebraic polynomas of the degree no higher than n. The task (1), (2) will be considered in the selected pair of spaces (x, y), in which it is equivalent to the operator equation k x ≡gx +t x = y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y). Let us consider on [a, b] the system of points T0, T1 ,. . . , tn (a <t0 <t1 <... <tn <b). The approximate solution of the problem (1), (2) will be searched in the form of xn (t) = n∑ k = 0 ck (t – a) α+k, where unknown coefficients {ck} n k = 0 are determined from the conditions of the Collow of Constitutional Court: (K xn) (t j) = y (t j), j = 0, n. (3) Conditions (3) are a system of linear equations of the type n∑ k = 0 γk j ck = y j, j = 0, n, (4) where y j = y (t j), γk j = (k [(t - a) α+k]) (t j). (5) For the constructed computing scheme of the collocation method, the following results are fair. Theorem 1. Let the functions GK, K = 1, M, Y ∈ C [A, B], {tk} nk = 0 - zeros of the polynoma of the Lyandra degree+1 on [a, b]. The task (1), (2) has the only solution for any right side of Y. Then the system (4), (5) for all n ≥ N0 is unambiguously resolved and the corresponding approximations of X ∗ N (t) will converge who will be converged by the solution of pro → ∞ in the metric of space X = IαA+(LP), 1 ≤ P <4. Mark. Note that with p ≤ 2, the passage rate is defined as ∥x ∗ ∗ n∥x = o {en (dx ∗), where EN (dx ∗) is the best uniform approximation of DX ∗ algebraic polynomas of the degree not higher than n. Theorem 2. Let the functions GK, K = 1, M, Y satisfy the conditions of dilipshitsa, {tk} n k = 0 - the nodes of Chebyshev I or II, the extreme points of the Polynoma of the I Byshev of the 1st kind. The task (1), (2) has the only solution for any right side of Y. Then the system (4), (5) for all n ≥ N0 is unambiguously resolved and the corresponding approximations of x ∗ n (t) converge at n → φ to the exact solution in space x = iαa+(lp), p = φ, at the speed of ∥x ∗ −x ∗ n∥x = o {lnn en (dx ∗ p}, Yu.R. Agachev, M.Yu. Pershagin 15 Where EN (DX ∗) P is the best uniform approximation DX ∗ ∈ LP with algebraic polynomas of the degree not higher than n. Theorems 1 and 2 are proved using the results of the general theory of close methods of functional analysis (see, e.g., [1]), as well as the theory of approximation of functions (see in [2], [3], [5] - [7] ).
