. Geometric optics in a three-dimensional Riman space in the Maple package T. A. Zhakkova Tatar State Humanitarian and Pedagogical University according to the geometric interpretation of the Farm principle at the limit of geometric optics in an optically transparent anisotropic and heterogeneous environment with the refractive tensor of the Nik (x) 64 photon trajectory (light of light) coincides with the geodetic line in the riman space with the metric tensor Gik (x) = nik (x). Thus, the entire geometric optics of an optically transparent, heterogeneous, anisotropic environment boils down to the theory of geodetic in a three -dimensional riman space with an Euclidean signature of metric. So, the equations of the spread of light in a transparent heterogeneous and anisotropic environment take the form D2x2 dτ2 + ωijk dxj dxk dxk dτ = 0, (1) where ωij, k = 12 (∂igjk + ∂jgik-∂kgij)-optical symbols of the Christoffel I-th I-th) genus, ωijk = n jlωjk, l-optical symbols of Christoffel of the II genus. Here are three demonstration examples of the study with specific cases of the spread of light rays in optically heterogeneous media using a package of Maple programs. 1. The study of the focusing properties of an optical environment with flat symmetry. –8 –6 –4 –2 0 2 4 6 8 x –8 –6 –4 –2 0 2 4 6 8 y –2000 –1500 –1000 –500 0 z 0.5 0.7 0.8 0.9 v_rho –1 –0.5 0 0.5 0.5 1 v_phi –1800 –1600-1400 –1200 –1000 –800 –600 –400 –200 0 v_z Fig. 1 Fig. 2 The geometry of the initially parallel bundle of light rays in the anisotropic and heterogeneous optical cut 65 de with flat symmetry is investigated, when the optical properties of the medium depend on the direction of the beam of light and the coordinate Z. We create graphs of geodetic tubes (Fig. 1) and graphs of phase trajectories (Fig. 2) according to generated initial conditions. As a result, the obtained geodetic and phase trajectories are combined on one graph. 2.

We create graphs of geodetic tubes (Fig. 3) and graphs of phase trajectories (Fig. 4) according to generated initial conditions. As a result, the obtained geodetic and phase trajectories are combined on one graph. 3. A study of the dispersion of light rays in an anisotropic optical environment with flat symmetry. The equations of colored rays in the dispersing heterogeneous anisotropic optical environment with flat symmetry are investigated. The behavior of three rays of different colors has been studied: red, green, blue. 66
