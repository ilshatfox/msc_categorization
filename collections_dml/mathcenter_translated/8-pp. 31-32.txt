) Effective resistance of one three -phase heterogeneous environment in the work made an analytical calculation of effective sorpoting ρeff = Lim R → Z | <R ρ (Z) W (Z) dxdy / ∫∫ | <r w (z) dxdy ( 1) a heterogeneous three -phase structure, the homogeneous components of which are the first (S1) and second (S2) quadrants, and the lower half -plane (S3) of the plane Z. Resistance ρ (z) ≡ ρk phase SK constantly. Function w (z) = wk (z), z ∈ SK, holomorphic in each of the homogeneous components, and on the lines of their section satisfies the conditions: IM [ρ1w1 (y) - ρ2w2 (y)] = 0, re [w1 (y) (y1 (y) ) - w2 (y)] = 0, 0 <y <mm, Im [w1 (x) - w3 (x)] = 0, re [ρ1w1 (x) - ρ3w3 (x)] = 0, 0 <x <x <x < Φ, IM [w2 (x) - w3 (x)] = 0, re [ρ2w2 (x) - ρ3w3 (x)] = 0, −mber <x <0. (2) using the results of work [1], [2], where the general solution of the problem (2) was found, the expression ρ electa = ρ3 √ 2θ1 + θ2 + θ1 + θ2 ei sign (θ2–θ1) α (θ1, θ2), 31 where was found for resistance (1). θ1 = ρ1/ρ3, θ2 = ρ2/ρ3, α (θ1, θ2) = (1– θ1) (1– θ2) 2 √ 2 (θ1+θ2) (1+θ1) (1+θ2). This result looks especially simply in the case of a wedge (ρ2 = ρ3): ρex = ρ2 √ 3ρ1 + ρ2 ρ1 + 3ρ2.
