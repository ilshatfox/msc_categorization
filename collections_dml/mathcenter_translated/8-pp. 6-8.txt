) Weak reversibility in the weight modules of whole functions, B (R), W (R) - non -negative increasing functions on the semi -shaft [0, +least), such that RK = O (Exp H (R)), K = 0, 1 , 2,. . . , w (r) = o (h (r)), limr → ger w (r) ln h (r) = +∞. (1) Determine the space xk = {f ∈ H (cn): ‖f‖ = = sup zăcn | f (z) | Exp (h (| z |) + kw (| z |)) < + φ}, k = 0, 1, 2 ,. . . ; X0ε = {f ∈ H (CN): ‖F‖0ε = = SUP Zorn | F (Z) | EXP (h (| z |) + (1 + ε) W (| z |)) < + urb}, ε> 0; X = ⋃ xk, x0 = ⋂ x0ε. By virtue of (1) x (x0) with the topology of the inductive (respectively, projective) limit - the topological module above the ring of polynomial n complex variables. 6 for the linear topological space of functions X, continuously invested in h (CN), we recall the definition of a weakly reversible element (first given in [1], see also [2] - [7]): function F ∈ X is called poorly reversible if it is called poorly if Approximation 1 = Lim PMF in X, where PM - is possible. It is clear that the weakly reversible function does not turn anywhere at zero. For spaces X and X0, the following statement takes place. Theorem 1. Let h (r), w (r) are the same as higher, and the condition is complied with +ger ln t (r) r3/2 dr = +inous, where t (r) = sup k≥0 rk / Mk, mk = sup r≥0 hk (r)/ expw (r). Then each F ∈ X (x0), which has the form F = Exp accord, where ∗ is a whole function such that | onic (z) | ≤ h (| z |)+kw (| z | for some K - in the case of x and | onic (z) | ≤ h (| z |) + (1 + ε) W (| z | for all ε> 0 - in the case of x0, is poorly reversible in the corresponding space X or X0. If F ∈ X (X0) is poorly reversible, then any polynomial is approached in X (X0) linear combinations of the functions Z K1 1. . . z kn n f. Using the theorem 2 from [7], it can be deduced that the polynomials are dense in X (x0). Therefore, the theorem 2. In conditions of theorem 1, the IF of the IF, generated by the function F, coincides with the entire module X (respectively x0). L and T R and T R A 1. Shapiro H. S.
