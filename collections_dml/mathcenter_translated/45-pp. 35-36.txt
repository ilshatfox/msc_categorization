The conditions for isomorphism of groups of autorphisms of completely decomposed groups without torsion. ZS in the work some necessary and sufficient conditions of isomorphs were obtained: the pear of the pears1 of the automorphiisms of two quite times the abbrous absorptions without twisting. This question is closely in binding: SHN with the structure and: humorphisms of classic soil (see! IJ) and the work of the author [2j.
