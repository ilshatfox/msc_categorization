Materials of the Youth School-Conference UDC 519.7; 512.581 On one digital signature scheme on the Platform of 2-Category O.P. Sobolev1 1 o.sobolev94@yandex.ru; Kazan (Volga) Federal University in this article examines a modification of digital signature. The modification was carried out by using 2 -Category as a cryptographic platform. Key words: digital signature, 2-cathegors, algebraic cryptography. This paper shows how one can implement a digital signature (analogue of the signature from [1]) using the 2-Categories algebraic platform. Detailed descriptions of the 2-Category can find in [2], [3] and [4]. As far as we know, before 2-cathegors in cryptography were not used. The protocol of [1] is easy to rewrite for the case of conventional categories. Here is the implementation of a similar idea in the case when the algebraic platform will be 2-cathegors. This means that there are not only ordinary morphisms (1-Morphism), but also morphisms between morphisms (2-Morphisms), which have a number of properties that can be found in the above literature. First, we describe the designations used, h is an open hash function, k is a fixed number h: {0.1} ∗ → {0.1} k, k ∈Z, e ∈Z-open key, m-message for the signature, in The form of a bit line. The secret key consists of two parts: 1) 2-Morphism β: F → F, i.e., X F F β 2) reversible 1-Morphism R: X → Y This makes it possible to form 2-Morphismα = R Ber-1, where Be - vertical superposition: x x f β β ... β Horizontal superposition: O.P.

Considering that t = sr -1: tγt -1 = sr -1 (rβehr -1) r S -1 = sβEH S -1. Note that an analogue of this protocol is possible, using only horizontal superposition in 2-cathegors. Literature 1.
