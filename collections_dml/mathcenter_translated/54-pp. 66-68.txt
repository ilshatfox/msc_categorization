Bauman examines many points of the Steiner of the four elements of the premium to L1 space. Keywords: banakh space, Lindensstrauss space, Steiner point, Lipshitsev sample. Let (x, ∥ · ∥) - banakh space. For a given set Mn = {X1 ,. . . , xn} ⊂ x, many points of the Steiner ST (MN) consists of such points S ∈ X, for which n∑ k = 1 ∥xk - s∥ = inf {n∑ k = 1 ∥xk −x∥: x ∈ X} =: | ST | (MN). The space X is called the L1 or the space of Lindensstrauss, if X ∗ isometrically isomorphic l1 (µ) = l1 (e, σ, µ) for some set E, some σ-algebra σ of the subsets and a certain σ-adnsal measure µ, determined by Σ. This class of spaces includes all the spaces of C [k] truly significant functions, continuously on (Hausdorfov) compact K, space C0 (E), Lear and many others. The space N is Previous to L1 when and only when it is isometrically isomorphic L NU (here L N ux means the N-dimensional space with the norm ∥x∥ = ∥ (x1,., XN) ∥ = max {XI | : i ∈ {1,., n}). The spaces of Lindensstrauss are well studied (see [1], [2], as well as [3]). In the space warning to L1 space, many points of the Steiner ST (MN) are not empty [4] for an arbitrary set mn ⊂ x, and the set of ST (MN) can be characterized [5] using metric segments (a metric segment with the ends of A B.B. Bednov 67 and B in the banach space X is a lot of M [a, b] = {x ∈ X: ∥x –A∥+∥x −x = ∥a −b∥}). For three points in the space warning to L1 space, many points of the Steiner are fully characterized by the following theorem. Theorem a [6], [5]. Let the space X preferable to L1, X1, X2, X3 ∈ X. Then the many ST (x1, x2, x3) = m [x1, x2] ∩ m [x2, x3] ∩ m [x3, x1] = ∩3i = 1s (XI, Ri), where Ri = 12 (∥x j - XI∥+∥xk −xi∥ - ∥xk −x j∥), {i, j, k} = {1.2.3}. Sets ST (XI, X J, XK), {I, J, K} ⊂ {1.2,3,4}, and ST (X1, X2, X3, X4) are interconnected. Let's show some patterns. Theorem 1. Let X preferably to L1, X1, X2, X3, X4 ∈ X. There is a point S ∈ ST (X1, X2, X3) ∩ ST (X1, X2, X3, X4). Investigation 1. Let the X preferably to L1, X1, X2, X3 ∈ X. For an arbitrariness of x4 ∈ X, there is such a point S ∈ ST (X1, X2, X3) that S ∈ ST (X1, X2, X3, X4). Let us give an example of building points of the Steiner of a four -element set. Theorem 2. Let the X Previously to L1, {X1, X2, X3, X4} ⊂ X, Z ∈ ST (X1, X2, X3, X4), S ∈ ST (XI, X J, Z). Then S ∈ ST (X1, X2, X3, X4). Next, we enter the following designations. Let r j k i = 12 (∥xi - x j∥+∥xi - xk∥ - ∥x j - xk∥). This is the distance from point XI to (any) point S ∈ ST (XI, X J, XK), which follows from the theorem A. Let ρi = min {r j ki | {j, k} ⊂ {1,2,3,4} \ {i}, m4 = {x1, x2, x3, x4}. Theorem 3. Let X Previously KL1, M4 ⊂ X. The smallest value is ∥x1-s∥ equal. Investigation 2. Let the X preferable to L1, m4 ⊂ x, ∥x1 - x4∥+ ∥x2 - x3∥ = max (m4). The largest distance from point X4 to the set ST (X1, X2, X3, X4) is achieved for the point S ∈ ST (X1, X2, X3) ∩ ST (M4). Theorem 4. Let x Previously to L1, M4 ⊂ X, ∥x1 --x4∥+∥x2 --x3∥ = max (M4). Then ST (m4) = ∪r1] ∥x1 --x4∥ --ρ4], i2 = i2 (r1) = [a, b] at a = max {∥x1 −x2∥ --r1, ∥x4 −x2∥ - ∥x4 −x1∥+r1}, b = min {∥x2 −x3∥ - ∥x1 −x3∥+r1, ∥x2 −x3∥ - ∥x4 −x3∥+∥x4 –x1∥ -r1}. In connection with the ambiguity of the display of STN: (X1,., XN) → ST (X1,., XN) the question of the existence of a good sample naturally arises. Lipshitseva sample from the ST3 in the space C [k] really significant continuous on the compact K functions is built in [6]. We formulate the corresponding result. Theorem B [6]. Let X1, X2, X3 ∈ C [K]. Display V (x1, x2, x3) (t) = min {x1 (t)+ r1, x2 (t)+ r2, x3 (t)+ r3} is a lipshit sample from the display ST3 (here Ri = Ri (x1, x2, x3) - numbers from theorem a). 68 Materials of the International School-Conference from the ST4 display in the C [k] Lipshitsev sample. Theorem 5. Let X1, X2, X3, X4 ∈ C [K]. OT
