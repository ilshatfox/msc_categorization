) The calculation in the topological spaces The concept of the calculation of the families of structural objects naturally appears in a wide variety of areas of mathematics. One of the calculation paradigms is its identity of continuity regarding the topologies that naturally arise in the description of structural objects. The report is supposed to consider the existence of computable numbering of a special species for topological spaces with efficient bases. sixteen
