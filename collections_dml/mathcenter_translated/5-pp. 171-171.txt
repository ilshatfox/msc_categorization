) Infinitezimal affin transformations (T2 (MP), \ 7*) above the most mobile spaces I.P. Egorov in the work [1] showed that the most moving spaces of affinance association of zero curvature are projective-ineuvic spaces of the second lacquer of the embolism. Previously, we obtained canonical decomposition of production infinitezimal affin nravation (T2 (L1 N), \ 7 •) above the projective-cycling spaces and the conditions imposed on the components of this decomposition. Theorem. Algebra Lee L- all infinitezimal affin of 'ny transformations (t2 (mn), \ 7*) over maxi. We are laid out with a tram-in-the-line group in a direct sum.
