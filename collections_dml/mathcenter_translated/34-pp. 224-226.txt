. Groups of equivalence classes of pseudo ∆-psyche T. T. Yusupov Nizhny Novgorod State University named after N.I. Lobachevsky, tty@list.ru Consider the smooth main stratification Let U - the open coating of the base b, rδ (u) = u for all u ∈ U and δ ∈ ∆, and a (u) - associated with the atlas of stratification ă. Action R U: P -1 (U) μ ∆ → P -1 (U) is called local raising R if p ° rδ u = rδ ° p and rδ u (v · t ′) = rδ u (v) t · t ′ For all V ∈ P -1 (U) and T ′ ∈ T K. The set r = {ru | u ∈ U} We call the pseudo -indentation R. The arbitrary local raising R U is set by the formula r u δ (ψu (b, g)) = ψu (b · δ, g) · subison (b), where Su): U → T K is a smooth display, with Suε ≡ e and suαβ (b) = s u α (b) + s u β (b · α) 226 for all U ∈ U, B ∈ B and α, β ∈ ∆; Here ε and e are units of groups ∆ and T K, respectively. Therefore, pseudo -release R determines the set of smooth displays {Sueth: U → T K | U ∈ U, Δ ∈ ·}. If the functions of the transition {ψv u} atlas a (u) are satisfied with the equality D (ψv u ®rδ - ψv u) = dsvδ - dsu) for all u, v ∈ U, u ∩ v 6 = ∅, δ ∈ ∆, then we call a pair (A (u), s (u)) pseudo ∆-atlas. Steam ρ = (ă, a), where a is the class of Atlas A (U) equivalence, is called pseudo ∆-spray. For the described objects, morphisms are defined and, in the way, the category K (b, t K, ∆, r) pseudo ∆-parabs is built. The addition of the transition functions {ψv u} and display {subδ} induces an algebraic operation on it. Offer. The formula [ρ] = [ρ ′ + ρ ′ ′] correctly determines the algebraic operation on the set B (b, t K, ∆, r) of the equivalence of objects of category K (b, t K, ∆, r). At the same time, b (b, t k, ∆, r) becomes a group. If in previous definitions, the family {Sueth} consisting of identically zero display is considered in previous definitions, then the category of pseudo ∆-pranks will turn into a category of almost ∆ stratification studied in the works [1] and [2]. Theorem. Groups of classes of equivalence are almost ∆-psyche and pseudo ∆-pissing is isomorphic. However, the subgroups of groups of equivalence classes of almost ∆-psyche and pseudo ∆-psyche allowing an unambiguous raising of the action R are non-mornsomorphic. 227 L and T R A T R A 1.
