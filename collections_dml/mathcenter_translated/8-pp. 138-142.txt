The convergence of the spectral decays of one integral operator in the space L2 [0, 1] Consider the integral operator: AF = 1 - X∫ 0 A (1 - X, T) F (T) DT + α X∫ 0 A (X, T) (t) dt, x ∈ [0, 1], (1) 138 where a (x, t) = (x - t) n - 1/(n - 1)!, α2 6 = 1. Operator (1) It is the simplest of operators, some derivatives of the nuclei of which allow ruptures of the first kind on the lines t = x and t = 1 - x. With α = 0, there is equalness of decays on its own and attached functions (S.P.F.) of this operator and decomposition into a trigonometric series of Fourier [1.2]. Here we get a similar result and in the case of α 6 = 0. It turns out that spectral decays according to S.P.F. Operator A is equal to not one, but with two trigonometric rows of Fourier in a certain way of selected functions. We denote through Rλ = (E -age) −1a to the resolventa of Fredgolm (E - a single operator, λ is a spectral parameter). For certainty, we assume that n even (the case of odd N is considered similarly). The task of finding Rλ is reduced to solving the following regional problem: V (N) (X, λ) - λDV (x, λ) = Bf (x); (2) pv (j) (0, λ) + qv (j) (1, λ) (j = 0,.., N - 1), (3) where v (x, λ) = (v1 (v1 (v1 x, λ), v2 (x, λ) t, f (x) = (f (x), f (1– x)) t (t - transponing sign), d = (α + 1 0 0 α - 1), b = 1 2 (α + 1 α + 1 α - 1 - α), p = (0 0 α - 1 - q α), q = (1– α α + 1 0 0 0). Theorem 1. If V (X, λ) satisfies (2) - (3) and the corresponding homogeneous marginal task has only a zero solution, then Rλ exists and rison (x) = v1 (x, λ) + v2 (x, λ) . This theorem allows you to obviously find a formula for Rλ and get the necessary estimates. Consider another regional task: u (n) (x, λ) - λdu (x, λ) = bf (x); (4) 139 u (j) (0, λ) = u (j) (1, λ) (j = 0,.., N - 1), (5) where u (x, λ) = (u1 (x, λ), u2 (x, λ)) t. Remove from the λ-thoroughness along with the circular surroundings of the same small radius Δ0 λk (k = 1, 2,.), In which the conditions of theorem 1, or (α+1) λk or (α-are violated 1) λk are their own values ​​of the marginal task: y (n) (x) - λy (x) = 0, y (j) (0) = y (j) (1) = 0 (j = 0,... N - 1). The resulting area is denoted through sδ0. Theorem 2. For any f (x) ∈ L [0, 1] and any Δ ∈ (0, 1/2), the equality of lim r → µ ‖ωrf‖ [δ, 1–δ] = 0, where ωRF = 1 2πi ∫ | λ | = r 2∑ i = 1 (vi (x, λ) −ui (x, λ)) dλ and r such that {λ ∣∣ | λ | = r} ⊂ ⊂ sδ0; (V1 (x, λ), v2 (x, λ)) t - solution to the problem (2) - (3), (u1 (x, λ), u2 (x, λ)) t - solution of the problem (4) - (5). We will now get the main result. Theorem 3. Let α2 6 = 1. Then for any f (x) ∈ L [0, 1] and any Δ ∈ (0, 1/2) The ratio takes place: lim r → ger max δ≤x-δ-δ-δ --δ -δ ∣∣∣∣SR (f, x) - 1 2 σr | α + 1 | (f + g, x) - 1 2 σr | α−1 | (f - g, x) ∣∣∣∣ = 0, where SR (F, X) - partial amount of a number of Fourier functions f (x) according to S.P.F. operator A for those characteristic numbers λK for which | λk | <r; σr (f, x) - a partial amount of the trigonometric series Fourier functions f (x) for those numbers k for which (2kπ) n <r, and r is such that {λ ∣∣ | λ | = r} ⊂ sδ0; G (x) = f (1 - x). 140 Proof. According to the theorem 1 1 2πi ∫ | λ | = r Rλf dλ - 1 2πi ∫ | λ | = r (u1 (x, λ) + u2 (x, λ) dλ = ωrf. (6) But 1 2πi ∫ | λ | = r Rλf dλ = —sr (f, x), 1 2πi ∫ | λ | = r u1 (x, λ) dλ = - 1 2 σr | α+1 | (f + g, x), 1 2πi ∫ | λ | = r u2 (x, λ) dλ = - 1 2 σr | α−1 | (f - g, x), since Bf (t) = 1 2 ((( α + 1) (f (t) + f (1– t)), (α - 1) (f (t) - f (1- t))) t. Therefore, the statement of the theorem follows from (6) by virtue of theorem 2. Investigation. If f (x) ∈ L [0, 1] and almost everywhere f (x) = f (1 - x), then lim r → ger max δ≤x δ - δ | sr (f, x) - σr | α+1 | (f, x) | = 0. If f (x) ∈ L [0, 1] and almost everywhere f (x) = −F (1– x), then lim r → φ max δ≤x δ | sr (f, x ) - σr | α−1 | (f, x) | = 0.

Kostin (Moscow) to the question of restoring the coefficients of the rows according to some orthogonal systems of functions, let P = {Pi} ger-a sequence of natural numbers that are different from 1. Let's call a P-system or The system of multiplier functions of the price, or the system of generalized Haar functions (see [2]) built according to the corresponding P, and denote it {ther (x)} φ0.

Let SMN (x) converge almost everywhere on [0, 1) to f (x) at n → ∞. How to restore the coefficients of a row on F (x)? In general, the question is incorrect, since there can be several such ranks, so it is necessary to impose additional conditions on a series, about
