Lobachevsky in the article to solve the Koshi type problem for one class of linear fractional and differential equations, a general projection method based on the apparatus of algebraic polynomas is used. Its theoretical - functional justification is given; In particular, the convergence of the method has been proved. Keywords: fractional -differential equation, task of the Koshi type, general projection method, approaching generalized polynomas, convergence of the method. Let M - fixed natural number, α0, α1 ,. . . ,αm — заданные вещественные числа из промежутка (0,1]. Введем вещественные числа {σk }  m k=0, опреде ляемые рекуррентной формулой σk −σk−1 =αk ,k = 0,m, σ−1 = 0. Рассмотрим задачу Type Koshi (D σk A+ X) (A) = 0, K = 0, M −1, (1) for a linear fractional -differential equation of the type K x ≡ (dσma+ x) (t)+ m+ 1∑ k = 1 gk (t) (d σm -k a + x) (t) = y (t), a <t ≤ b. (2) The functions are GK, K = 1, M +1, Y - known, X - desired defined on [a, b]; d σk a+x - the fractional derivative (left -handed) Riman -Liwill functions X order σk. Problem (1), (2) under certain conditions for known functions has a single solution (see. , for example, [1, p. 603]). The formula for solving the problem (1), (2), (2), in practice, will require the calculation of fractional integrals. Therefore, the task of building a solution with a certain degree of accuracy, using that, is relevant or other approximate method. As you know, the fractional derivative of the Riemann -Liwill of order α> 0 is set by the formula (dαa+x) (t) = 1 Γ (1+ [α] −α) d 1+ [α] d T 1+ [α] tˆ a x (τ) dτ (t −) α - [α], where [α] is a whole part of the number α. Moreover, for the existence of this derivative, the condition of the condition tˆ a x (τ) dτ (t -) α - [α] ∈ Ac [α] [a, b] is sufficient. 38 Materials of the International School-Conference here AC [α] [a, b] means a class of functions f (t) that have an absolutely continuous derivative of f ([α]) (t) order [α] (f (f] [α]) ∈ AC [A, B] ≡ AC 0 [A, B]). Let q = [σm] +1, β - an arbitrarily fixed material number from the interval (0.1), H0, β [A, b] - the space of functions that satisfy the [A, b] condition of the Helder with the indicator β and converts in zero at point a. Provided β+ q −σm <1, i.e. β <{σm}, where {σm} = σm - [σm], we introduce two spaces into consideration: y = h0, β+q --σm [a, b], x = w̃ q h0, β [a, b] -the space of functions that satisfy the conditions (2), which have on [a, b] an absolutely continuous derivative of the Q-1, q-ya derivative of which belongs to H0, β [a, b]. The norms in these spaces are asked as follows: ∥y∥y = ∥y∥c +h (y; β +q –σm), y ∈ Y; ∥x∥x = ∥x (q) ∥c +h (x (q); β), x ∈ X. Here ∥y∥c is the usual Max -Norm in the space of continuous in the segment [a, b] functions, h (y; β) - the smallest constant gelder of the function y ∈ Y. In a pair of spaces (x, y), the task (1), (2) can be written in the form of one operator equation k x ≡ dx +gx = y (x ∈ X, y ∈ Y), (3) where operators D and g are set The first and second components in the left side of the equation (2): (dx) (t) = (dσma+ x) (t), (gx) (t) = m+ 1∑ k = 1 gk (t) (d σm --k a+ x) (t). In a pair of spaces (x, y) the operator D of the fractional integration coincides with the fractional -integrated operator of the Caputo: (dx) = (j q --σma+ x (q)) (t) ≡ 1 γ (q σm) tˆ a x (q) (τ) dτ (t ττ) σm --q+1. Therefore, the operator d: x → y is continuously turn. Note that for the fractional derivative of the order, α occurs the ratio (dαa+x) (a) = 0 if x (t) = (t - a) γ, γ> α. Given this property for fractional derivatives, the approximate solution of the equation (or problems (1), (2)) will be searched in the form of a generalized polynoma xn (t - a) σm n∑ i = 0 ci (t −A) I, (4) Let HN have a subspace of algebraic polynomas of the degree not higher than n. In the spaces introduced above, we introduce the subspace xn = {(4)} ⊂ x, yn = hn ⊂ y. Let pn: y → yn - an arbitrarily fixed design operator Y on yn. We will determine the unknown coefficients {ck} of an approximate solution (4) from the condition that XN (t) is an accurate solution to the equation KN xn ≡ dxn +pngxn = pn y (xn ∈ XN). (5) Yu.R. Agachev, A.V. Savina 39 equation (5) is an equation of the general projection method of solving the problem (1), (2) set by the PN design operator. This operator can be projection, i.e., polynomes of the degree not higher than n leave in place, or do not have such a property. It should be noted that well -known projection methods, such as the methods of gallerkin, likelifers and collocations, are set by projection operators. However, the methods built on the basis of the summation of the rows of Fourier and interpolation polynomas, as a rule, do not possess this property. The next theorem gives a substantiation of the projection method determined by the equation (5). Theo
