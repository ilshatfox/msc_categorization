One equation for functions, holomorphic outside the triangle, let the correct triangle with the vertices T1 = - ../3/3, t 2 = f3t 1, tz = (32t1, where/3 = echr (21gi/3). Consider equation 6 (V f) (z) ::::: l f [at (z)] = g (z); z e d, m = l where g (z) e (d), in the class of functions f (z ) E A (cd). Transformation a 2j_ 1 (z) = tj + tj + i - z, j = 1, 2, 3, t4 ::: t1, they transfer D to trembles, having the general side with the original side , and the transformations Azj (Z) = 2TJ - Z - into the triangles that have common peaks with it, well, that is, they throw the point Z from the region into its appearance, where the solution is determined! (Z). In such a production, one cannot interpret Operator V as a class of the SIME Operator of the Convent and apply to it the powerful methods of the subsequence, based on the remarkable properties of the whole functions of the exponential type and the transformation of the stroke. Therefore, the method of integral equations is changed, based on the presentation of the solution in the form of an integral of the type of koshi along the border of the triangular With n Estimated density. It has been established that a homogeneous equation (G (Z) ::::::: o) has the only non -trivial solution of FO (Z) in the class of functions whose boundary values ​​satisfy the conjure of Helder on each open side of the triangle, and only have it to the tops Logarithmic features. The heterogeneous 51 task is to be solved then and only when J G+(T) F0-(T) DT = O. DDs can be applied to the study of the inravation task (lacunar problem of the moments of the hamburge RA) 00 j P (t) sign (t) exp (LTT) T3K+2DT = C,.,, -00 where P (t) = P (p (t) (t) (t) = p (t) (t) (t) = p (t) {Зt) - целая функция экспоненuиального типа и ,\ =  {-../3/З, t >О; 2 ../ 3/3, t <about}. Ya. Godalya (Lublin, Poland), V.V. Starkov (Petrozavodsk) on the boundary behavior of functions, holomorphic in the ball and in Polykhkoga earlier [1] for the holomorphic in the circle of functions, we obtained the results connecting the behavior of such functions with the behavior of their derivatives. Now we are trying to endure these results in C11 • It is not difficult to do in ~ tea polycore, but it is difficult in the case of a ball (in this case there are vivid effects of multidimensionality).
