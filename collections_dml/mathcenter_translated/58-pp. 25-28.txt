Keywords: asymptotic, non -stationary equation of thermal conductivity, a singularly indignant regional task, laser impulse, mobile border administration. Interest in the study of various kinds of local-nomple systems and processes of transfer (energy, masses, impulse) is connected on the one hand 26 “Lobachevsky Readings-2019” with the natural direction of the development of science (equilibrium systems, local and local-moral ones), and on the other hand, and on the other with The rapid development of technology, the use of materials with a complex structure (polymers, liquid crystals, capillary-porous and other dispersed systems), laser equipment. The rapid development of experimental technology led to the fact that, starting from the 80s, ablation of ablation was carried out with laser impulses of the nanoso-ore range, in subsequent years more and more attention is paid to ablation under the influence of ultra-short laser impulses of picosecond and femo-spacing ranges, for which the quasi-stamation regime is not abusive reached [1,3]. In the case of metal, one of the features is the effects associated with electron-phonon interaction, and phenomena due to hot electronic gas in the substance. The task of studying the influence of boundary conditions and the impulse regime of irradiation on the distribution of temperature in the material is also important. The work considers the task of finding the distribution of temperature in solid material when irradiated with ultra -crop laser impulses, a two -temperature model of describing transitional phenomena in nonequilibrium electronic gas and a lattice with a subpicosecond laser impact in the following productions [2.3]: a diffusion type, which is a system of two parabiles thermal conductivity equations; The model of the hyperbolic type transfer equation, which is a system of two hyperbolic type transfer equations. Problem of the task model of diffusion type. The two -temperature model [2] describes the trance of the energy of the energy inside the metal using the system of non -stationary thermal conductivity for the temperature of the electrons and the lattice: CE ∂TE (Z, T) ∂T = CEν ∂TE (Z, T) ∂Z + ∂ ∂Z (χE ∂TE (Z, T) ∂Z) +DK · Q −µE (TE (Z, T) –TI (Z, T)), (X, T) ERN, CI ∂TI (X, T) ∂T = ciν ∂ti (x, t) ∂z +∂ ∂z (χi ∂ti (x, t) ∂z) +dk · q +µe (te –Ti), (x, t) ∈, TE (z , tk) = te, k (z), te (z, t0) = te, 0 (z) = t0, k = 0, m, ti (z, tk) = ti, k (z), ti (z , t0) = ti, 0 (z) = t0, dk = {1, k = 2p 0, k = 2p +1, ω = {(x, t): 0 <z <h, t0 <t <tinger }, - —χ · ∂te (z, t) ∂z ∣∣∣∣ z = 0 = je (t), je (t) = −k0b0 (te, s (t)+t0) 2 Exp { - Ta TE , s (t) +t0}, - χ · ∂ti (z, t) ∂z ∣∣∣∣ z = 0 = ji (t) = –ϱν L, ν = ν0 exp { - tu, s +t0 }, L.A.

The functions ψe, ψi and constants σ1, e, σ1, e, σ1, i, σ1, i determine the modes of heat exchange on the back of the plate. The function Q (Z, T) describes the type and nature of the heat source. This model is applicable in the case when the classic laws of Fourier work, i.e. For times, there are many more than the characteristic time τE of establishing equilibrium distribution in electronic gas, which in most tasks is several femtoseconds. Model of the hyperbolic type transfer equation. The two -temperature model of the diffusion type is fair, provided that the time of establishing equilibrium in the subsystems is much less than the time of establishing equilibrium between them.
