Models of wind excitement using the DUMKA program D.V. Chizhikov Moscow Physics and Technical Institute 1 Introduction in this work will follow the theory of narrowly approached, which was received by Zakharov and Smilga (1981) and investigated by Zaslavsky (1989) for a model of wind excitement. The main features of the model of wind excitement [1]: 1. A separate description of the wind and wave fields; 2. A fundamentally new analytical approximation of a nonlinear evolutionary member; 3. A new description of dissipation processes in wind waves, based on the idea of ​​a nonlinear blocking spectrum. 2 The mathematical model of the wind excitement with the basis of the wave block of the model is the equation of the transfer of action in the spectral form: ∂n (ω, θ) ∂t + ∂c accord (ω, θ) ∂ç + ∂cϑn (ω, θ) ∂ϑ + ∂cθn ( ω, θ) ∂θ = p (ω, θ), (1) where ∗ and ϑ-spherical coordinates-ugly, cll = cg sin θ r, cϑ = cg cos θ r cos vent , CG = G 2ω, R is the radius of the Earth, P is the function of sources and drains, including the function of the interaction of waves and winds (p+), nonlinear interactions in the spectrum of wind waves (p ±) and dissipation (p -). To describe non -linear interactions, the theory of narrowly approximate approximation of the wave spectrum is used [3]. In 227, the calculation of the model of wind excitement. . . The framework of this theory from the two -dimensional spectrum n (ω, θ) pass to two integral functions - the spectrum of wave numbers n (kx) and the parameter of narrow direction ∆ (kx): n (~ k) = n (ω, θ)/ (k dω (k dω k) dk), (2) n (kx) = ∫ n (~ k) dky, (3) ∆ (kx) = ∫ k2yn (~ k) dky/(n (kx) k 2 x), (4) Where KY is the coordinate in the space of wave numbers, perpendicular KX, and the KX direction coincides with the direction of the wind. To describe dissipation, the idea of ​​the lock interval is used. The blocking spectrum was found as an exact solution of the approximate kinetic equation for a stationary case when the kinetic integral is zero. Additionally, it is assumed that if the current spectrum is less than the level of the lock spectrum, then dissipation is absent. But when the current spectrum reaches the level of the lock spectrum, the dissipation member simply destroys the entrance member. This approach allows you to overcome all the difficulties of parameterization of the dissipation member. It is believed that the growth of the spectral density of the wave action is impossible above the blocking spectrum. 3 The setting of the problem of wind excitement, which are subject to solving the equation of a narrowed approximation model, has the form DN DT = P 0 (KX) + P + (KX) - P - (KX), (5) D DT (∆N) = R 0 (KX) + R + (kx) −r - (kx), (6) where p 0 (kx) = ∂n (kx) ∂t = a1 ∂ ∂kx (ln [∆−1 (kx)] ∂ ∂kx [∆ (∆ ( KX) K 19/2 x N 3 (KX)]), (7) 228 D.V. Chizhikov r 0 (kx) = ∂ (∆n) ∂t = a2 ln [∆ −1 (kx)] ∆ (kx) k 15/2 x n 3 (kx), (8) p + (kx) = ∫ ∫ ∫ P + (~ k) dky = βω (kx) n (kx), (9) p - (kx) = ∫ p - (~ k) dky = αn (kx), (10) r + (kx) = ∫ k2yp + (~ k) dky = βω (kx) n (kx) ∆ (kx), (11) r - (kx) = ∫ k2yp - (~ k) dky = αn (kx) ∆ (kx) (12) with boundary conditions n (kx) ∣∣ kb = c rap −5/6u2/3a k −19/6 b, (13) ∂n (kx) ∂kx ∣∣∣∣ kb = −19 6 c∆G −5 /6u2/3a k −25/6 b, (14) ∆ (kx) | KB = ∆KB = 0.3 (15) and the initial data n (kx) ∣∣ t = 0 = n0 (kx), (16) ∆ (kx) | t = 0 = ∆0 (kx). (17) Using the assumption that p - (kx) = p + (kx) with kx> kb (therefore, r - (kx) = r + (kx)), we will solve the equations DN DT = BN, (18) d dt (∆n) = b∆ (19) with boundary conditions (13) - (15) and initial data (16), (17), where Bn ≡ p 0 (kx) and b∆ ≡ r 0 (kx) set by formulas (7) and (8), respectively. 229 Calculation of the model of wind excitement. . . 4 The purpose of this work is the optimal improvement of the Fortran program for the CRAY computer, numerically deciding the equation of the model of wind excitement. To do this, it was necessary: ​​1. Apply a scheme of a higher (third) order of local approximation by time; 2. Calculate the own values ​​of the Jacobi matrix to assess the number of chimes of the task; 3. Transform the right side for faster calculations. 5 The approximation of the right parts of the equations in the space K X is used the following scheme (BN) I = A1 FI+1/2 - FI -1/2 [(KX) I 1 - (KX) I -1]/2, (20) (20) (20) (20) (20) (20) (20) (20) (20) (20) (20) B∆) i = a2 (kx) i 15/2 y3i∆i ln∆ −1 i, (21) where fi+1/2 = di+1/2 [ai+1∆i+1y 3 i+1 - 1 - ai∆iy3i] (kx) i+1 - (kx) i, (22) di+1/2 = 2 ln∆−1i+1 ln∆ −1 i ln ∆1i+1+ln∆ −1 i ( 22.1) or di+1/2 = ln∆−1i+1+ln∆ −1 i 2, (22.2) a ∆i = ∆ ((kx) i), ai = (kx) i 19/2, yi = N ((kx) i). Having replaced in (18) non -linear differential operator of the second order (7) by a variety operator (20), we get the task of koshi for the system of ordinary differential equations of the line of the line: y0i = N0 (KX), I = 0, M, 230 D.V. Chizhikov y0 = c∆g −5/6u2/3a k −19/6 b, y1 - y0 (kx) 1 - (kx) 0 = −19 6 cier −5/6u2/3a k −25/6 b , [dy dt] i = (BN) I, I = 2, m. (23) Having replaced the non -linear operator (8) in (19), we get the task of the cat for the system of ordinary differential equations of the direct method: ∆0i = ∆0 (kx), i = 0, m, ∆0 = ∆KB , [d (∆Y) dt] i = (b∆) i, i
