Fedotova Institute of Mathematics with the UC RAS, Polina81@rambler.ru Let γ is an open convex cone in rn (γ 6 = Rn). Determine the space e accord (γ) of smooth functions to γ ​​as follows. Let (h̃k) φ k = 1 - the sequence of positive convex functions on R, satisfying the conditions: 165 a) ∀k ∈ N ∃t0 ∈ R: h̃k (t) - h̃k+1 (t)> t, t> t0; b) ∀k ∈ N ∀α> 0 ∃s ∈ R: h̃k (t) - h̃k+ 1 (t+ α)> s, t ∈ R; c) lim t → φ h̃k (t) t = +ger ∀k ∈ N. Let the sequence (∗̃k) φ k = 1 convex growing non -negative on [0, φ) of the functions satisfies the conditions: d) ∃ak> 0, bk, ck> 0 ∀k ∈ N ̃̃k (t) - ̃̃k+1 (t)> akt -bk, t> 0; e) ∀k ∈ N ∀α ∈ [0, 1] ̃K (t) - ̃̃k+ 1 (t+ α)> —CK, t> 0; f) lim t → φ ̃̃k (t) t = +φ, ∀k ∈ N. For x γ, we denote the distance from X to the border of the cone γ, let HM (x) = h̃m (ln 1 d (ln 1 d (ln 1 d (ln 1 d (ln 1 d (ln 1 d (ln 1 d x)), ψm (x) = ̃̃m (‖x‖‖), m ∈ N. Let ∗ - the family of functions lus (x) = hm (x) + ψm (x). Using the normalized spaces Ephous (γ) = {f ∈ CM (γ): PM (F) = SUP X ma, | α | 6M | (dαF) (x) | EXP (wor (x)) <mm}, m ∈ N, form the space e accord (γ) = lim m → ger preaper (γ). Through E ∗ onic (γ), we denote the strong conjugated space to e accord (γ). Let ∗ ∗ m (x) = sup y] (<x, y> –con (y)), ∀m ∈ N, lus ∗ - family of function ∗ ∗ m. We define the space p connect ∗ as an inductive limit of the normalized spaces piron ∗ m = {f ∈ H (cn): ‖f‖ ventration ∗ m = = sup zăcn | f (z) | Exp (ng ∗ m (IM Z)) (1 + ‖z‖) m <¾}. Definition. The transformation of Fourier -laplass functionality S ∈ E ′ onic (γ) is called the function ŝ (z) = <sise, e --i <z, ă>>, z ∈ Cn. Theorem a [1]. The transformation of Fourier -laplass establishes epimorphism between the spaces e ∗ ∗ (γ) and p connect. 166 In this work, we announce the following results. Theorem 1. Polynomas are dense in e accord (γ). Theorem 2. The transformation of Fourier -laplass establishes isomorphism between the spaces e ∗ ∗ (γ) and pü). L and T R A T R A 1. Mannanov M.M.
