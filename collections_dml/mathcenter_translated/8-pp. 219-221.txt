) Description of the classes of subspace, attached to algebra von Neumann, in the space of representation b (h), associated with the weight of the algebra von Neumann, acting in the Hilbert space H, the lines S is carny in h and the study of EM classes is continued ( S), fm (s), lm (s) respectively closed, orthosen and split subspaces of space S, annexed by KM, begun in [1] and [2]. Let the ffic - the exact normal weight on the algebra b (h) of all limited linear operators in a sepaable calbert space h, π care: b (h) → b (h) - the canonical representation of the algebra b (h), associated with ng. Let M = π vent (b (h)), and h ≥ 0 - a self -consolidated operator, unambiguously determined by equality ng (·) = τ0 (h (·)). Here τ0 is the standard 219 mark on b (h), and the expression τ0 (hx) for x ∈ B (h)+ is understood in the following sense: τ0 (hx) ≡ lim ε → 0+ τ (h1/2ε xh 1/ 2 ε), where hε = h (1 + εh) −1 ∈ B (h) +, ε> 0. Theorem 1. Hilbert space h representing the algebra b (h) associated with ∗, isometrically isomorphic to the gilberta space C2 (h ) Gilbertashmidt operators. Let ∗π - the weight obtained by the transfer of weight perfire to the algebra π press (b (h)): onic (π press (x)) ≡ С (x) (x ∈ B (h)+). Through dher, we denote the lines of weight uction in the hyalbert about wanderings C2 (h). Theorem 2. In the framework of the structure described above, S = Dwor = ñarent. Let further weight ffic is such that H is limited. Theorem 3. If x ∈ LM (s), then ∃p ∈ B (h) PR is such that x = SP = {h1/2px ∗ | x ∈ N accord}. Theorem 4. For SP ∈ LM (S) the following conditions are equivalent: (i) sp ∈ EM (S); (ii) ∃q ∈ B (h) PR (pHQ = 0, R (p) +R (Q) = H). Theorem 5. For SP ∈ LM (S) the following conditions are equivalent: (i) sp ∈ FM (S); (ii) r (q) = ker (pH) entails ker (QH) = R (p).

Ulyanov (Moscow) About the Levy and Marcinkevich theorems for the Haara system let T = {Eint}+gerN = −M - the trigonometric system, the number α ∈ (0, 2), and the function F ∈ L (0, 2π (0, 2π ). We put Aα = Aα (t) = {f: +ger∑ n = −mm | cn (f) α <mm}, where cn = cn (f) = 1 2π 2π∫ 0 f (t) e --intd t . In 1934, Levy proved that if f ∈ A1 (t), and the function F is analytical on f ([0, 2π]), then the function f (f) ∈ A1 (t). In this regard, Levy raised the question of what functions F can be taken in this theorem. In 1958, Katsnelson established the opposite for the Levy theorem and, thereby, only analytical functions F act from class A1 (t) to class A1 (t). In 1940, Martsinkevich began to consider many functions F ∈ Aα (t) with α ∈ (0, 1), where transformations F type J 1 α occurred. Let ω (δ) - a module of continuity, and τ (n) - positive 221
