) Effective algorithms for solving tough elliptical problems with large parameters1 Considere of of the end-element approximation and iterative algorithms for solving a rigid elliptical regional problem with large parameters with an older derivative. The rate of convergence of algorithms does not depend on the spread of the coefficients and the sampling parameter. 1. Introduction, let D ⊂ Rn, N = 2 - a limited area with a lipshit border γ. Let d = g∪ω, g∩ω = ∅ and γ = g∩ω - the lipshitsev surface of the contact between the sets G and ω, which are associations of the final number of topologically separated lipshit areas G (I) and ω (J): G = mg⋃ I = 1 g (i), ω = mω⋃ j = 1 ω (j), g (i) ∩g (j) = ∅, ω (i) ∩ω (j) = ∅ for i 6 = j. We will also call the sets of G and ω areas, and areas G (I) and ω (J) - their components. Consider the following task of the conductor in D: div (a (x) ∇u) = f in d, u = 0 on γ, (1.1) where n × n Matrix A is represented in the form of a (x) = a1 (x) + ω (x) a2 (x), (1.2) a1 and a2 - n × n matrix, ω (x) = {1, x ∈ G, ωj, x ∈ ω (J). (1.3) 1 work was carried out with the support of the RFFIF, the project N 99-01-01146 3 here parameters 1 ≤ ωj ≤ µ, j = 1, 2 ,. . . , Mω, matrix AI (x) (i = 1, 2) are symmetrical, ai ∈ C1 (d ′), where d ⊂ d ′, and there are constant νi> 0, µi> 0, such that the condition is νi‖ organiz 2 ≤ (ai (x) ₽, lection) ≤ µi‖ξ2 (1.4) is made for all x ∈ D ′ and for all vectors ă ∈ Rn. Further, we assume that µ2 ≥ ν1. The task (1.1) was previously investigated in the differential case. For A1 - a single matrix, ωj = ω, j = 1 ,. . . , Mω and a2 (x) | ω = const in [1], [2] a asymmetric algorithm of the solution was built with the speed of convergence independent of ω. In [3], this method was symmetrized, and in [4] and in [5] for respectively asymmetric and symmetrical algorithms, the restriction of A2 (x) | ω = const was removed. Algorithms are based on the idea of ​​iterations in the subspace, see review in [6]. For another approach to the problem, see [7]. Let's say a few words about the structure of this work. § 2 introduces triangulation of the areas in question; The necessary end-element spaces are introduced in § 3 and their basic properties are considered; In § 4, an approximation of the problem (1.1) is built, obtained by the simplest method of final elements using linear elements. To solve the final -element analogue, the problems (1.1) proves existence, unity, continuous dependence on the right side and convergence to the exact solution for all parameters ωj and the step of the mesh h. In § 5, an iterative algorithm G.M. Kobelkova [4] finding a solution to the end-element analogue of the problem (1.1). To analyze this algorithm, the W. Queck approach was used [55]. This algorithm is asymmetric and it is impossible for it to automatically choose iterative parameters. The next 3 sections are devoted to the methods of correcting this deficiency. In § 6, symmetrization of the algorithm G.M. Kobelkova based on the idea of ​​J.H. Bramble and J.E. Pasciak [9]. In § 7, following the work of Yu. Ilyash, T. Rossi, J. Toivanen [10], the method of minimal Ita of Lancosh is used to organize the process and the selection of iterative parameters. In § 8, symmetrization of the algorithm G.M. Kobelkova, based on the idea of ​​N.S. Bakhlavov, G.M. Kobelkova, E.V. Chizhonkova [3]. Compared to symmetrization of § 6, the dimension of the task decreases by excluding the unknown U, but at each step of the algorithm, the Laplace operator has to be converted. If for the latter there is only a certain pre -conditioning, then such an iterative process will be two -stage. In § 8, for a special case of the so -called adaptive grid, ways to overcome this problem are demonstrated. The rate of convergence of all constructed algorithms does not depend on the parameters ωj ∈ [1, urb] and the step of the grid h. For the convenience of presenting evidence of all statements, they are collected in a separate section - § 9. 2. The triangulation of areas, let x (1) γ ,. . . , x (nγ) γ means nγ quasi -aisively arranged points on γ, and x (nγ+1) γ = x (1) γ and all points of intersection of curves γ and γ (if any) are included in many storage {x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x (x j) γ} nγ j = 1. Let DH - a polygonal area with the peaks X (1) γ ,. . . , x (nγ) γ and γh - its border. Here H denotes the length of the smaller rib, nγ = nγ, h - the number of boundary ribs. Denote γg = γ ∩ g, γω = γ ∩ ω (perhaps one of these curves is an empty set). Also designate what cuts x (1) γg ,. . . , x (n γg) γg points from the set {x (j) γ} nγ j = 1, belonging to the curve γg, and through x (1) γω ,. . . , x (n γω) γω - points from the set {x (j) γ} nγ j = 1, belonging to the curve γω. The dots from the set {x (j) γg} nγgj = 1 form broken γgh, from the set {x (j) γω} nγωj = 1 - broken γωh. Let x (1) γ ,. . . , x (nγ) γ means nγ quasi -aisively arranged points on γ, and the length of the largest rib is not more than h, and all points of the intersection of curves γ and γ (if any) are among {x (x)} nγj = one . Let GH - a polygonal area with the peaks X (1) γ ,. . . , x (nγ) γ, x (1) γg ,. . . , x (n γg) γg and γh ∪ γg
