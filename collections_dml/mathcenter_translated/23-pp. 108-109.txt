Local invariant algebra of functions on the N - Mortal Torah 10. Consider C (TN) - Banakhov Algebra of all continuous functions on the N - Mortal Tora TN. Closed Zagalgebra A algebra C (TN) on 110 is called uniform if it contains constants and shares the points of the set TN. Take A, uniform algebra on TN, invariant relative to shifts, and MA is its space of multiplier functionals. The transformation of the Gelfand of the function F ∈ A is called the function F̂ on the multiple MA, determined by the ratio F̂ (m) = M (f). Using these designations, we introduce â = {f̂ ∈ C (ma): f ∈ A}. They say that F ∈ C (TN) is locally on TN belongs if for any point α ∈ TN there is such the surroundings U 3 α and such a function g ∈ A, which F coincides with G everywhere on U. Algebra A is called local on TN, if any function belonging locally on TN to A is an element of algebra A. Algebra A is called local if the local algebra on MA. The first example of the non -Kelkalnaya algebra was proposed by E. Kollin in [1]. Theorem 1. For N ≤ 2, each uniform algebra on TN, invariant relative to shifts, is local. With N> 2 there are non -KENTAL invariant algebras on TN. 20. In the work [2], the following question was posed by the J. Raidster: if b and a are two uniform algebras on x = ma, in addition, b ⊂ a and each function from a locally belongs B, whether it follows that A = B? The solution to this issue led to the next result. Theorem 2. For N ≥ 3 on the N - Mortal Tora TN, there is such a chain of uniform algebra invested in each other {ak} ger = 1, invariant relative to the shifts that a) mak = ma1 for all k = 1, 2 ,. . . ; c) Dimak AK -1 = 1; C) Each function from âk locally belongs to algebra âk -1.
