Yakovleva2 1 Andre01071948@yandex.ru; Samara State Technical University 2 Julia.yakovleva@mail.ru; Samara State Technical University in the article considers the solution to the problem of Koshi for one system of differential equations of the fourth order, not containing less than a fourth order, methodir. The regular solution of the Koshi problem for the system of differential equations of the hyperbolic type of fourth order is built in explicitly using the Riman matrix. The Riemann matrix was obtained through the hypergeometric functions of the matrix argument. Keywords: a sistem of differential equations of a hyperbolic type of fourth order, Riemann method, Riemann Matrix, Koshi's task. The system of differential equations of the fourth order MU ≡UXX Y Y +λu = 0, (1) where u (x, y) is the desired N-dimensional vector-function, λ is the constant square matz of the order (n × n), has two double characteristics . It is known that the solution of the Koshi problem for the system of differential equation of a hyperbolic type, all the equations of which have the same pairs of characteristics, can be built by the Riemann method, generalized for a matrix case [1, 2, 3]. The task of Koshi. Find a regular solution u (x, y) ∈C 4 (r × r) system of equal (1) in the plane {(x, y): x ∈ R, y ∈ R}, satisfying the conditions in the uncharacter of the ristory line y = x : U (x, y) | y = x = a (x), ∂u (x, y) ∂l | y = x = b (x), ∂2u (x, y) ∂l 2 | y = x = C (x), ∂3u (x, y) ∂l 3 | y = x = d (x), where a (x), b (x), c (x), d (x) ∈C 3 ( R)-specified vector-function,-→ l = (1p 2,-1p 2)-Nor Mal to the non-characteristic line. A.A. Andreev, Yu.O. Yakovleva 31 for the operator MU ≡UXX Y Y +λU, the operator M ≡vxx y y +vλ, where V (x0, y0; x, y) is the square matrix of the order n. Riemann matrix for the system of equations (1) is the solution V = V (X0, Y0; X, Y) Tasks M ∗ V = 0, V (X0, Y0; X, Y) | X = X0 = θ, V (X0, y0; x, y) | y = y0 = θ, vx (x0, y0; x, y) | x = x0 = (y - y0) e, vy (x0, y0; x, y) | y = y0 = y0 = y0 = y0 = y0 = y0 = y0 (x −x0) e, where (x0, y0) is an arbitrary point of the plane {(x, y): x ∈R, y ∈R}, E, θ is a single and zero matrix of order N, respectively. Taking into account the determination of the generalized hypergeometric function of the matrix of the argument [2, 4], the Riman matrix has the form V (x0, y0; x, y) = (x - x0) (y - y0) 0f3 (1, 3 2, 3 2; x −x0) 2 (y - y0) 2 16 λ). (2) using the resulting matrix of Riemann (2), the regular solution of the Cossack problem for the system (1) was obtained explicitly and has the form U (x0, y0) = a (y0)+ 1 4 y0∫ x0 [(x - y0 ) 0f3 (1, 3 2, 3 2; τλ) (a ′ ′ (x) −c (x))] d x +1 8 y0∫ x0 [(x - x0) (x - y0) 0f3 (1, 3 2, 3 2; τλ) (a ′ ′ ′ (x) −b ′ ′ (x) −c ′ (x))] d x +1 8 y0∫ x0 [(x −x0) (x - y0 ) +1) 0f3 (1, 3 2, 3 2; τλ) (D (x) −4a ′ (x) −4b (x))] d x - + 1 72 y0∫ x0 [(x - x0) 2 ( x - y0) 3λ0f3 (2, 5 2, 5 2; τλ) (a ′ ′ (x) −c (x))] d x - 1 9 y0∫ x0 [(x −x0) 2 (x - y0) 2λ0f3 (2, 5 2, 5 2; τλ) (a ′ (x)+b (x))] d x - - 1 3600 y0∫ x0 [(x - x0) 4 (x - y0) 4λ2 0f3 (3, 7 2, 7 2; τλ) (a ′ (x)+b (x))] d x - 1 2 y0∫ x0 [(x −x0) 2 (x - y0) 0f3 (2, 5 2, 5 2 ; τλ) a (x)] d x - - 1 225 y0∫ x0 [(x - x0) 4 (x - y0) 3λ2 0f3 (3, 7 2, 7 2; τλ) a (x)] d x - - 1 529600 y0∫ x0 [(x-x0) 6 (x-y0) 5λ3 0f3 (4, 9 2, 9 2; τλ) a (x)] d X, 32 materials of the school-conference where τ = (x - x0) 2 (x --Y0) 2 16.
