The method of the epipler of the construction of the veneer profiles Lazarev D.F. Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. N. Chebotareva of Kazan State University in the work analyzed the Epplerâ€™s method [1] solving the reverse regional problems of aerohydrodynamics, compiled a corresponding gram of construction of wing profiles, a series of numerical calculations was made and results were compared with accurate analytical solutions. (Z) Fig. 1 Fig. 2 The difference between the Eppler method and a number of others (see, for example, [2]} is that the desired contour of the profile is divided into n parts (see Fig. 1, 2). For each section, except for the first and last, that is selected that which angle of attack, in which the speed can be considered constant, i.e., in fact, the distribution of speeds is set as "shelf".
