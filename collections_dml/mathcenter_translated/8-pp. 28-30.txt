Let PN-one of the following operators: either the Fourier Operator φn, which in accordance with each function onic ∈ C2π n-th the segment of its row Fourier according to the trigonometric system; or the operator of the lagrange ln [1], which each function mon ∈ C2π puts in accordance with its trigonometric LN ivil LN onic (lus; s) degrees n = [n/2] by nodes sk = (2πk + ω) /N, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 0 ≤ ω = const ≤ π. Theorem 2. Let onic ∈ W RZα = {ψ ∈ C2π | ∃∃ (r) ∈ Zα}, 0 <α ≤ 2, r + 1 ∈ N, 0 <β ≤ 2.

In the spaces of Sigmund, close meters of solution of the weakly algular integral equation of the first type of Ax ≡ - 1 are studied 2π 2π∫ 0 ln ∣∣∣∣sin s - σ 2 ∣∣∣∣ x (σ) dσ + + 1 2π 2π∫ 0 h (s, σ) x (σ) dσ = y (s); (1) 29 HERE H (S, σ), Y (S)-known continuous 2π-periodic functions, X (σ)-the desired function, poorly singular integral is understood as unreasonable. Theorem 4. Let the nucleus h (s, σ) such that the operator r: w kzβ → w k + 1zβ (0 <β ≤ 2, k + 1 ∈ N) is quite continuous, where rx ≡ 1 2π∫ 0 h ( s, σ) x (σ) dσ. If the homogeneous equation Ax = 0 has only a zero solution, then the operator A: w kzβ → w k+1zβ -intelligently reverses.
