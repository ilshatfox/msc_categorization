Analysis of one mathematical model from the theory of synchronous machines Y. A. Makarov, A. I. Shepelyavay · St. Petersburg State University, as@a.sl 020. SPB. EDU examines the non -linear differential equation of the second on the row, which, as shown in [1], describes the Dirka of synchronous electric machines quite well. The nature of the stability of stationary points has been studied. WHOs are described by the southern ka • 1 -based paintings of the location of the trajectories on the phase plane in a certain strip containing stationary points.
