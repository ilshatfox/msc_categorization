) The solution of the regional problem for one B -elliptical equation in the infinite region, let D ++ = {x> o, y> o> o} is an area, which is the first quarter of the coordinate plane limited by the axes of the oh and OS. The task is considered: to find even the equation of the equation D2 and D2 and K di 2 d 2 + -d 2 + -d +>. and = o, k> o, x U U U (1) 221 in the area V ++, satisfying the boundary condition and l f = o = <p (y) (2) and with R ---+OO RAM conditions (3) Here CR = {(x, y) e2: x2+ y2 = r2} - circle, ck = v ++ n cr, l = afz (a> o, (3> o), a, {s - · constant; '' Re sv, where s in are many even NOs in infinitely continuously differently differently function F (y) that satisfy the inequality of lv; f (y) i ~ (~+~ h) "for all m, n, 1, 2, .. and y> o, where in;-m-tank rteration of the operator Bessel WU = ~ -1- ~: u.
