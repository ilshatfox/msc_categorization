Materials of the Youth School-Conference UDC 519.688, 511.174 Some issues of the additive theory of numbers N.V. Potapova1, A.V. Rozhkov2 1 potapova50@gmail.com; Kuban State University 2 ros.seminar@bk.ru; Kuban State University in various number systems studies the function of finding the sum of numbers in composition with arithmetic functions. Keywords: numbers theory, factorial, computed algebra, cryptography, hash function, unidirectional functions. The introduction of the initial goal of the work was mainly methodological: to demonstrate the most important and poorly designed concepts of modern cryptography, such as hash function and unidirectional functions, the existence of which, by the way, has not yet been strictly proven [3]. Definition. The function χ, which makes the message of the fixed length in accordance with the arbitrary length message, is called a hash function. It is equivalent, the display χ: n → n, having the final image is called a hash function. Definition. The function ψ: n → n is called unidirectional if for any n ∈ N the image ψ (n) = M is calculated for polynomial time, but there is no polynomial algorithm that calculates the prototype n image m. We introduce the main definition of our work. Let some number system be set, for example, decimal. Definition. Let A ∈N, and A = A1A2 ... an - (decimal) recording of the number A. The function of the sum will call the display S (A) = A1 +A2 +... +an. The function of the amount in many respects is well modeling the behavior of the hash of the function and a unidirectional function. In fact, modern hash functions have mainly 512 bit image, in other words | χ (n) | ≤ 2512. Since S (A) <9 ∗ LG (A), the restriction S (A) ≤ 2512 means that a ≤ 10 19 · 2512 ≈ 10 (10150). This is a fantastically large number. So, the size of the visible part of the universe of the RA VEN is approximately 1026 m., And its volume, respectively, is 1078 m3. Even if we fill out our universe by particles of the Planck length of 10–35, having a volume of 10-105, then we will need only 10183 particles - an insignificant number compared to monster 10 (10 150). Therefore, from a practical point of view, the function of the sum of numbers is a very good candidate for the role of hash function. However, the behavior of the function S (A) is very whimsical. Mysterious relationship of the sum of the digits of the work with the sum of the digits of the dubbins. In fact, s (210) = S (1024) = 7, S (510) = S (8765625) = 40, S (210 · 510) = 1. N.V. Potapova, A.V. Rozhkov 105 is no better than when working with the sum of numbers. For example, S (44445) = 21, S (55555) = 25, but 444445+55555 = 1000,000. The sum of the figures of the natural number of the idea and methodology proposed in the work [1], [2]. The calculations were produced using a computer algebrygap4.8.8 computer. The official address http://www.gap-system.org/ to find the sum of the figures of the factorial inspired us with the stirling formula: N! ≈ P 2nπ (n e) n. An extensive numerical experiment, which took about 300 hours and conducted on the Core i5 4430 3 GHz processor, allowed us to put forward a hypothesis that | F (N) | <1 for any n> 100, where f (n) = s (n!) N −2ln n 2 +2. The calculations were carried out to n = 106. The million factorial contains approximately 5 million decimal signs. Statement. For 100 <n <106, the following results were obtained: 1. For all n, inequality is performed | f (n) | <1. 2. The mathematical expectation of the function f (n) quickly strives for 0: with N> 104 it does not exceed a module of 10–5, and with N> 105 the waist waist module does not exceed 10–6. 3. The dispersion of the function f (n) at n> 105 does not exceed 0.001. 4. The density of the distribution of the values ​​of the function f (n), if we consider it random, is close to normal. Now it remains to give a theoretical justification of this result. Some generalizations the sum of the numbers of the number depends on the number system. We conducted calculations for K-digit systems, k ∈ {2.10,17,197}. Based on the results of the calculations, the hypothesis was put forward that for any Koznut system there are such real positive numbers A, B, C and such a natural number N, which for all n> n is the inequality (n!) N - a ln (n (nn (nn )+B ∣∣∣ <c. For the above values ​​K, the calculations made it possible to put forward a hypo of the Theza that a = k 2ln (k), b = p k, c = ln (k), n = 4 ∗ 104. In addition to the sum of the figures of the natural number of the natural number, we also investigated the functions of the type F (n) = KN. These functions, in superposition with the function of the amount of numbers, 106 materials of the Youth School-Conference well illustrate the hash-functions of the Odino-directional function. The fact is that in order to find the prototype it will come to check exhibited a lot of candidates. Statement. In the decimal number system for all natural k <10 for function S (KN) the following inequality n (1 - LG (K)) <S (KN) <n (1+ LG (K)) is performed. Similar formulas take place for other number systems. The conclusions were proposed and, interesting hypotheses about the behavior of the function of the sum of the numbers of the natural number in different number systems: s (n!) ≈ 2n ln N 2 −2n, N (1 - LG (K) <S (KN) were proposed.
