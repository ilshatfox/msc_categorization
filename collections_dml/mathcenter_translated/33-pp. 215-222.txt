. A numerical study of the spectral task associated with LBB resistance to schemes for the task of Stox I.V. Fedorov Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, Moscow Consideration of many tasks of hydrodynamics leads to the regional task of Stake     ∆ strong+ grad p = f in ω, div u = 0 in ω, u = 0 on ∂ω, (1) where ω is ω -limited coherent area, f = (f (1) (x, y), f (2) (x, y))-a given vector-function, u = (v (x, y), w (x, y) )-an unknown vector-function corresponding to speed, p = p (x, y)-a scalar function corresponding to pressure. For unambiguousness, P is assumed ∫ ω p dω = 0. This system is a stationary simplification of the problem of Nastye - Stox, which simulates laminar hydrodynamic currents, in case of currents with low speeds. Resolving issues (1) and regularity of decisions are lit in [3]. A numerical analysis of this task involves sampling by spatial variables, that is, the transition in the final spaces of UH and PH. In this case, an important characteristic of the 215 numerical study of the spectral task. . . The final spaces used are the implementation for them Inf-Sup inequality: the existence of such ΔH that sup uhorn (pH, div uh) ‖uh‖u> Δh‖ph‖p ∀ pH ∈ PH, (2) where ‖u‖u = (gradu, gradu) 1/2, ‖p = (p, p) 1/2, (∗, ψ) = ∫ ω canne dω. The expression (2) is called the LBB-consequences or inequality of Ladyzhenskaya-grandmother-Bretzi. Its implementation, i.e., the existence of the grid-dependent lower border Δ (ω) for ΔH, guarantees the existence and unity of the solution of the discrete analogue of the problem of Stox, as well as its stability [6]. Therefore, a large number of works are devoted to the search for LBB-resistant ultimately ultimately ultrasound spaces (see [4] and a reference book [7]). A discrete analogue of a generalized task can be rewritten in a matrix form (a b bt 0) (u p) = (F 0), (3) where u, p, f are coefficient vectors obtained by the decompositions of the corresponding functions according to the bases of spaces UH and PH, A = AT > 0 - the grid analogue of the Laplass operator (−∆), B is an analogue of Grad, BT - the grid analogue of Div. Then Inf-Sup inequality is equivalent (see [4]) uniform limited limit from the bottom of the younger non-mound value of the Schuru Schuru Schuru operator SH0 = B Ta-11B system (3), because Δ2 (p, cp) 6 (p, SH0 p) ∀ p ∈ ∈ RNP. Thus, the task of finding the LBB-constructs is reduced to the spectral problem {au+bp = 0, btu = λp. (4) For the pressure operator S0 of the classical problem of Stox (1) in [4], asymptotics of the size Δ (ω) for areas ω rectangular shape, the assessment Δ (ω) on top for flat areas of the type of curved polygons and it is shown that the own functions of the operator S0 They have features in the “corners” of the region, 216 I.V. Fedorov and the equation for the indicator of these features is also displayed, δ (ω) estimates for the regions of the ring and cylindrical shape are presented. In this paper, numerical estimates of LBB-controls were obtained on the triangular area, given by the ratio a of the two sides and the angle α between them. To sampling the task, the method of finite elements with a piece of speed is used, continuously on ω, and pressure, piece-to-standing in ω: uh = {u ∣∣∣ u ∈ S1 (△), △ ∈ Th/2, u ∈ C C (Ω), u = 0 on ∂ω}, pH = {p ∣∣∣ p | △ = const, △ ∈ Th, ∫ ω p dω = 0}. Here Th - triangulation with step H, obtained by the sequential breakdown of the triangle with medium lines, Th/2 - triangles with sides doubled. Discrete analogues of operators ∆, DIV, GRAD were built. The circulation of the Laplass operator was carried out using the BLAS package [12] with the front method for sparse matrices [5]. To solve the edge problem of Stake, the method of uzhavas of conjugated gradients was used [8]. The substantiation of the correctness of the construction of operators and the implementation of algorithms was carried out. In particular, the method of conjugated gradients made it possible to solve the edge problem of Stox for non -non -oidal speed functions, and you can check the convergence of the numerical solution of UH to the projection to the mesh of the analytical solution of U at the speed O (H2) [2]. To solve the spectral problem (4), namely, the assessment of the five younger own values ​​and the corresponding own vectors used the Lantzosha method implemented in the Arpack program package [10,11]. It is known that the spectrum of the operator S0 ≡ DIV △ △ ∇ ∇ discrete and limited, σ (s0) ∈ [C, 1], 0 <c 6 1/2 (see study of the spectrum of the Mossera in [1] and Lemma 1 of [9 from [9 ]). At the same time, 1 is an isolated own value of endless multiplicity. The presence of a complete orthonomated in the P -Medical System of Own functions is also proved. 217 numerical study of the spectral task. . .
