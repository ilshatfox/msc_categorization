) The dispersion of the electromagnetic field on the N-alignment of the flat waveguide in the work considers the task of diffraction of the electromagnetic wave on the branching of the waveguide. With the help of integrated operators of a special type, the task of diffraction is reduced to an endless system of linear algebraic equations (BLLIA). Using the abstract scheme of the approximate solution of linear equations [1] and assessments obtained in [2], the rationale for the reduction of the BLLI in Sobolevsky spaces was carried out. 239 Consider the branching of a flat waveguard with metal walls into N metal-dialectric waves. Let the axis X be directed along the spread of the wave, and the z axis passes along the junction. We believe that the metal partitions are located in the planes Z = BJ, J = 1,. . . , N. In this case, the thickness of the main waveguide A = BN - B1. Let the TE-Polyarized Fashion run on the left (X <0) from the uninocated wave. We will look for a dipragic field in the form of u+j (x, z) = φ∑ n = 1 bjn exp (—iγnjx) sin πn bj - 1 (z - bj - 1), x> 0, bj - 1 ≤ z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z ≤ bj, j = 1 ,. . . N, u - u - (x, z) = φ∑ n = 1 an exp (γnx) sin πnz a, x <0, where γnj = [k2j - (πn bj - bj - 1) 2] 1/2, γn = [k2 - (πn a) 2] 1/2, n = 1, 2 ,. . . . The conditions for the conjugation of the fields at x = 0 (the tangent components of the vectors e and h should be continuously lead to the system of functional equations a0 sin πn0 a z + ger∑ n = 1 an sin πn a z = 1 bjn sin πn bj - bj - bj - bj - bj - bj - bj - bj 1 (z - bj - 1), (1) —0γn0 sin πn0 a z + φ∑ n = 1 anγn sin πn a z = - φ∑ n = 1 bjnγnj sin πn bj - 1 (z - bj - 1) , j = 1 ,. . . , N. (2) Consider the integral operators with nuclei k+j (t, z) = 2 bj - bj - 1 µ m = 1 1 γmj sin πm bj - bj - 1 (t - bj - 1) × 240 × 240 × sin πm bj - bj - 1 (z - bj - 1), j = 1 ,. . . , N. Since these operators have their own functions sinπnt/(bj - bj - 1) and their own values ​​1/γnj, the identity is bj∫ bj - 1 mm∑ n = 1 bjnγnj sin πn bj - 1 (z - - z - bj -1) k+j (t, z) dt = φ∑ n = 1 bjn sin πn bj - bj - 1 (z - bj - 1), bj - 1 ≤ z ≤ bj. (3) Using identity (3), we convert the system (1), (2). By excluding the BJN coefficients, we get a system of functional equations relative to the coefficients AN ger n = 1 AN SIN πn a z + φ∑ n = 1 a 2 bj - 1 bj∫ bj∫ bj - 1 γn sin πn a t × × m = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 γmj sin πm bj - bj - 1 (t - bj - 1) sin πm bj - bj - 1 (z - bj - 1) dt = – a0 sin πn0 a z + bj∫ bj - 1 a0 line sin πn0 a t 2 bj - BJ -1 ger∑ M = 1 1 γmj × × sin πm bj - bj - 1 (t - bj - 1) sin πm bj - 1 (z - bj - 1) dt, j = 1,. . . , N. Equalizing the Fourier coefficients relative to the functions of sinπkz/a, we get BLLAU AK A 2 + inous n = 1 anαkn = a 0βk, K = 1, 2 ,. . . , (4) where is αkn = n∑ j = 1 2a4 (bj - bj - 1) π2 γn × 241 × (φ∑ m = 1 [(−1) m sin πnbj a - sin πnbj - 1 a] × × × × [ (−1) m sin πkbj a - sin πkbj - 1 a] × 1 γmj m2 [(ma) 2 - (n (bj - bj - 1)) 2] [(ma) 2 - (k (bj - bj - 1)) 2]), βk = - a 2 δk, n0 + n∑ j = 1 2a4 (bj - bj - 1) π2 γn × × (urb∑ m = 1 [(−1) m sin πn0bj a - sin πn0bj -1 a] × × [(−1) m sin πkbj a - sin πkbj -1 a] × × 1 γmj m2 [(ma) 2 - (n0 (bj - bj - 1)) 2] [(ma) ) 2 - (K (bj - bj - 1)) 2]). Theorem 1. The task of diffraction on the branching of the flat waveguide is equivalent to BSLAU (4) regarding the coefficients of the decomposition of the harmonic field in the uninocated waveguide. The close solution of BLLAU (4) can be found by reduction by lending the external amount and endless amounts contained in αkn, βK. We denote the reduced coefficients αkn, βk through α̃kn, β̃k, then the system (4) will take the form a 2 + n1∑ n = 1 anα̃kn = a 0β̃k, k = 1,. . . , N1. (5) When substantiating the reduction method, we will conduct assessments of the constant M1 and M2 (see [1]), using the inequalities of work [2], m21 ≤ [2a4 (bj - bj - 1) π2 n] 2 n1∑ k = 1 n1∑∑ n = 1 | γn | 2 (1 + n2) −α × × ∣∣∣∣∣ µ m = n2 + 1 1 γmj m2 [(ma) 2 - (n (bj - bj - 1)) 2] [ (MA) 2 - (K (bj - bj - 1)) 2] ∣∣∣∣∣ 2 ≤ 242 ≤ const · n - 2α+ε1, m22 ≤ [8a4 (bj - bj - 1) π2 dn] 2 mm ∑ k = n1 + 1 n1∑ n = 1 | γn | 2 (1 + n2) −α × ∣∣∣∣∣ n2∑ m = 1 1 γmj m2 [(ma) 2 - (n (bj - bj- 1)) 2] [(ma) 2 - (K (bj - bj - 1)) 2] ∣∣∣∣∣ 2 ≤ ≤ const · n - 2α+ε1, d1 = (bj - bj - 1) × × × × × × × × × × × × × Φ∑ m = 1 1 | γmj | m2 | (ma) 2 - (n (bj - bj - 1)) 2 | | (MA) 2 - (K (bj - bj - 1)) 2 | , D2 = (bi - bi - 1) × × ger∑ m = 1 1 | γmj | m2 | (ma) 2 - (n (bi - bi - 1)) 2 | | (MA) 2 - (K (bi - bi - 1)) 2 | , D = max (d1/d2), where the maximum is taken in all I, J, K and N, and ε - some small value. These estimates allow us to substantiate the existence and unity of the solution of the truncated system (5) in the Sobolev spaces of Hα with the right part of Lα. Theorem 2. The decision of the BSLAU (4) in the space Hα (0 <α ≤ 1/2) with the right side of Lα can be found by reduction. It follows that the solution of the system (4) exists only.
