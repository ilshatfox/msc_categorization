Approximation of the functions with average Cesaro with a variable indicator, let 1 ~ p < +oo, lp - the space of all measurable 27r -periodic functions F with the norm EN (j) p is the best approximation of the function F e l p trigonometric polynomas of the order not higher than p. . BUT . Akishev, G. D. Suttibaeva 15 Average Cesaro with a variable for the numerical series are determined by M. b. Kallan [1]. The approach of the continuous function of the average Cesaro with a variable indicator of the series Fourier was investigated by T. Ahobadze! 2]. The average Czezaro for a given function F E L 1 are determined by the formula A ~ n (f, x) = a ~ n ta ~~~ 1 sv (f, x), v = o where the numbers ip> -1, paws _ ( 1 + AP) (2 + AP) · · · (K + AP) K - K! 'Sv (f, x) - a partial amount of the Fourier series. In the case of AN = A, P = 1, 2, ..., the procedure for approaching the function F E LP by the average Cesaro was investigated by S. V. Stechkin, P. L. Ulyanov, V. E. Gate, L.V. Zhizhiashvili, M . F. Timan, V. M. Kokilashvili, I. A. Buadze. The report will provide statements about the deviation of a ~ "(!, X) from this function F. In particular, the theorem is proved. Empty 1 < +oo, t = min {p, 2}, 1 <an, n = 1 2, .... . - 1960. - No 5 - p. 62-73. 2. Akhobadze T.
