Materials of the Youth School-Conference UDC 512.554 Three-dimensional quasiPols with bilateral distribution of S.V. Panov1 1 Pansevakrasn@mail.ru; The Siberian Federal University, the Institute of Mathematics and Fundamental Informatics The article considers the structure of Flews, which are three -dimensional linear spaces over their nuclei. Keywords: Quasipol, half -floor. In accordance with [1], a quasi -group is the system of elements W (a, b, c, ...) with such a binary operation of multiplication °, which is equal to ASB = C any two of the elements A, B, C of the system unambiguously determine the third. The quasi -group with the unit E is a magnifying glass. If theq is a non -empty set with two binary operations + and °, while (q, +) - ABLEVA group, A (q ∗, ®) - magnifier, whereq ∗ = Q \ {0}, and one -way distribution is performed, then (Q ,+, °) is called quasiopol. The semi -floor is quasiPol with bilateral demonstrativeness. Pullaus is called all half a half that is not a field [2]. The left, right and middle nuclei of the half -floor (S,+, °) is called respectively the set: NL = {l ∈ S | ∀A, B ∈ S: (L °A) ®B = L X (A XB)}}; Nm = {m ∈ S | ∀a, b ∈ S: (a °m) °B = a ° (m °)}; Nr = {r ∈ S | ∀a, b ∈ S: (a °B) ® R = A ° (b ° r)}}. The nuclear of the semi -lap S is called the set of n (s) = nl ∩ nm ∩ nr, and the center is so many z (s) that each element commits with any S ∈ S. It is known that the half -floor can be considered as the left (right) vector space Above its left nucleus NL (right core NR) or as a bilateral vector space above n (s) or z (s) [2]. Work dedicated to the infinite quasi -powers arose at the beginning of the age and were closely related to the issues of constructing projective broadcast planes. They go back to authors such as L.Dickson ([3], etc.), O. veblen, J. H.Maclagan-wedderburn [4]. Unlike the final fields, the theory of which has been studied well, for quasi -fields and semi -fields of even small orders PN (P - a simple number) still remain open buildings of the structure [2], [5]. In this work, exclusively semi -fields are considered, which are three -dimensional spaces over their nuclei or center. Theorem 1. If in the half of the order P3, any element S lies in any underground of the order ≤ P2, then S is the field. From the theorem 1 it follows that the underground GF (P) is the maximum underground of the semi -floor s order P3, and as the base S can be selected {E, X, X2} for some X ∈ S, not O.Yu. Petrov 101 lying in a single underground. Based on this, we got the following result: Theorem 2. All our own semi -Poop of the order P3 (P is a simple number) contains an element X that satisfies either the condition XX2 ̸ = X2X, or with the conditions XX2 = X2X and XX3 ̸ = X2X2. If a magnifying glass (s ∗, °) Salfol S is switched, then both of the theorems listed are easily generalized in case of an arbitrary three -dimensional semi -floor of the Q3 order considered above their core q = PN (n - a natural number). The work was carried out with financial support from the RFFIF (project 16-31-00173). Literature 1. Hall. Group theory. - M.: Il, 1962 .-- 468 p. 2. Johnsonn.

Key words: digital darkened signature, partial darkened signature, RSA. Introduction to darkened digital signatures (Blind Signatures) can be found in [1]. In this article, they are called the signatures of “blind”. An important variety of darkened signatures are partial darkened signatures (Partially Blind
