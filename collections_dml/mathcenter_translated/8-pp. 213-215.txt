Grichi homogeneous logic with the only state, let N, m - natural numbers. Quantum logic (partially ordered set, OMP) L is called (n, m)-a renovated [1] if each atom is contained in 213 n blocks (block is the maximum inclusion of the family of pair of orthogonal atoms), and each block in L contains Exactly m atoms of logic L. Let L-final (n, m) -dorous logic. We denote through A - many all atoms L, through B - many blocks L and through S = S (L) - many states on L. It is easy to see that in this logic n card a = m Card b and there is a state equal to equal 1/m on any atom. We are interested in homogeneous logic l for which s (l) is one -element. Studies of orthomodular grilles with a given properties for S were carried out in a number of works by M. Navara, P. Ptak and V. Rogelievich. An example of OMP with 22 atoms with the only state (Miller, Grichi) was known. We built an example (3, 3)-the-home logic L17 c 17 atoms that allow the only state. Denote through AI, I = 0, 1, ..., 16 atoms L17. We describe the many blocks B of this logic: seven blocks setting a loop [2] about 7 have the form {a2i, a2i+1, a2i+2} (indices according to module 14); For the other 10 blocks, we will write out only indices from atoms {0, 8, 14}; {1, 5, 11}; {1, 7, 16}; {2, 9, 15}; {3, 7, 13}; {3, 11, 14}; {4, 10, 16}; {5, 9, 13}; {6, 12, 15}; {14, 15, 16}. Theorem. Cards (L17) = 1. CONSTENT. 1. (3, 3) -Dorous logic also arise when we examine the relational OMP on the final sets. For example, on an 8-element multiple, relative logic L has as horizontal components (3, 3)-aidal logic with 28 atoms. For this logic, Cards (L) = 1. 2. Recently, M. Navara built an example (2, 3) -Dorous logic that does not allow a two-digit state. Are there (2.3) homogeneous logic l for which Cards (L) = 1? The work was supported by the Russian Federation (project 01-01-00129) and the program “Universities of Russia” (project 990213). L and T R A T R A 1. Ovchinnikov P. G.

Terentyev (Cheboksary) The numerical and analytical solution of the bigarmonic equation is considered the marginal problem for the bigarmonic function in the multi-associated field. It is known that the bigarmonic function can be expressed through two analytical functions that can be found by well-known methods of the theory of analytical functions. In particular, in the case of double areas to solve the problem, you can use a conformal display on the ring of the parametric plane and look for analytical functions in the form of a series of Taylor. Two ways to determine the coefficients of the series are proposed: 1) comparing the coefficients with the same trigonometric functions and 2) satisfaction with the boundary conditions at separate points (collocation method). The first method allows in some cases to get an analytical solution, the second is to develop a numerical calculation algorithm for quite complex tasks. Numerical examples confirm the satisfactory coincidence of both methods. For areas with arbitrary, but non -overstraining boundaries, a numerical algorithm is developed, based on the use of the method of boundary elements to the integral equation for the bigarmonic function [1]. The task comes down to solving a system of linear equations. The method can be applied to the numerical solution of the bigarmonic equation in the multi -link area. As an application, the movement of bodies of various configurations in a limited maximum viscous fluid is considered [2]. 215
