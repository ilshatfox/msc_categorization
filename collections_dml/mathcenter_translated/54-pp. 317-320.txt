UDC 517.54 The solution of the heterogeneous regional problem of Riman on the beam with an endless index of the new method of R.B. Salimov1, A.Z. Suleimanov2 1 Salimov.rsb@gmail.com; Kazan State Architectural and Construction University 2 ayaz-suleymanov-91@mail.ru; The Kazan State Architectural and Civil Engineering University considers the regional task of Riemann with an endless index, when the regional condition of the problem is set on a positive real axis of the complex plane. To solve this problem, an approach is used, based on the elimination of 318 materials of the International School-Conference of the Infinite Rupture of the Argument of the Regional Condition Condition using a specially selected analytical function. Keywords: Riman's regional task, analytical function, endless index. Let D is the area in the plane of the complex variable z = x + i y, the boundary of which is the positive real half -axis L. It is required to determine the function tail (Z), analytical and limited in the area D, if its boundary values ​​satisfy the condition φ + (t) = g (t) (t) (t) = g (t) (t) = g (t) t) φ - (t)+ g (t), t ∈ L, (1) whereφ+ (t), φ - (t) - the limit values ​​of the functionart function for z → t, respectively, on the left and right, when, respectively, ℑz > 0 and ℑz <0, g (t) - a given function that satisfies the condition of the Helder on L (G (T) ∈ HL), G (urb) = 0, coefficient G (t) - a given function with the following properties: LN | G (t) | ∈ HL, Argg (t) = ν --tρ+ν (t), (2) ν -, ρ - specified numbers, ν -> 0, 0 <ρ <12, ν (t) - a given function, ν (t ) ∈ HL. In article [1], a solution to Riemann’s homogeneous problem is given, when in the regional condition (1) there is no term G (t), by eliminating the endless gap of Argg (t) using a specially selected analytical function. It is simplicity and transparency in comparison with the decision developed by N. V. Govorov-the founder of the scientific direction devoted to the tasks of Riman with an endless index [2] (p. 113-123). Brief information about the development of this scientific direction is given in [1]. In this paper, the approach used in the article [1] is used to find a private solution of the regional problem (1). Take the function E (z) = e (α+iβ) zρ, 0 ≤ arg Z ≤ 2π, β = νν --2, α = ββecρπ sin, analytic in the area D, the boundary values ​​of which e+(t), the boundary values ​​of E - (t) (designated as in the case of φ (t)) satisfy the equality E+(t) e - (t) = e --iν -tρ. (3) for z = r eiθ, r> 0, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π we have E (r eiθ) = exp {[ν --cosρ (π --θ) 2sinρπ + ν - sinρ (θ --π) 2sinρπ] r] r] r] r] ρ}. (4) The regional condition (1), multiplying by e+(t) and designating G1 (t) = e+(t) e - (t) | g (t) | ei argg (t), imagine this φ+(t ) E+(t) = g1 (t) φ - (t) e - (t)+e+(t) g (t), t ≤ l, (5) and by force (2), (3) g1 (t ) = | G (t) | eiν (t). (6) R.B. Salimov, A.Z. Suleimanov 319 as can be seen from the formula (4) (at θ = 0 and θ = 2π, r = t), ∣∣e+(t) ∣∣ = | e - (t) | = EXP (ν -1 cosρπ 2sinρπ tρ) → ∞ with t → urb. To eliminate this feature in the regional condition (5), we take a whole function with negative zeros f (z) = φ∏ k = 1 (1+ ZRK), 0 <r1 <r2 <. . . It is easy to check [3] (p. 272) that for this function for z = t> 0 there is a ratio of LNF (t) = t ˆ l n n (x) d x x (x + t), (7) where n (x ) denotes the number of zeros −r1, −r2 ,. . . Functions F (Z), for which rk ≤ x. We assume that for the indicated zeros there is the final limit of Lim X → و (x) xρ = ∆> 0. It can be shown that with t> 0, the formula (7) can be represented like this [2] (p. 125): lNF (t ) = π Thank youρπ tρ + i (t), i (t) = t mm̂ 0 n (x) −∆xp x (x + t). (8) In this formula, as in the work [2] (p. 127), we take N (x) = [∆Xρ+ 12] - an entire part of the amount ∆Xρ+ 12, then RK = (2x+ 12 than 1) 1 ρ, k = 1.2 ,. . . Considering that with θ = 0, z = r = t> 0 According to (4) lne+= (ν −1 cosρπ - i ν −1 2) t ρ, we choose the number ∆, which is included in the formula (8) so that π Thank you = ν --12 cosρπ. Then the function f (z) will be determined completely. At the same time, on the basis of the result of the Tats of the book [2] (p. 128) we conclude that E +(t) f (t) g (t) ∈ HL. For simplicity, without limiting the community, we will accept that for the function g (t), ν (t) of formulas (6) conditions are met | G (0) | = 1, ν (0) = 0, | G (urb) | = lim t → φ | g (t) | = 1, ν (φ) = lim t → φ ν (t) = 0, g (0) = 0, we determine the analytical and limited function in area D [4] (p. 119) γ (z) = 12πi ´ L lNG1 (x) d x x --z, the values ​​of which on l (γ+(t), γ - (t)) satisfy the condition HL ([5], S.S. 61, 66, 68), in addition, γ (φ) = 0 ([5], p. 68). The function χ (z) = eγ (z) is an analytical in region D and its boundary values ​​satisfy the regional condition χ+(t) = G1 (t) χ (t) [4] (p. 109), [1]. Given the latter, Kra
