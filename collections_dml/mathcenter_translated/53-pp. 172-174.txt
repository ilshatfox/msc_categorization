Yamalutdinova Kazan (Volga) Federal University, yamalytdinova@mail.ru an algorithm for automatic classification of physical and mathematical publications by one of the requirements of scientific journals to work before publication is the presence of a code that allowed the work to attribute work to the appropriate objective about the affection . For this, various classifiers are used, among which UDC, BBK and MSC2010 are most famous [1] - [3]. They contain alphanumer codes. Note that the process of manual selection of classification codes is difficult due to the large volume of classifiers. For example, UDC contains more than 120 thousand items. Therefore, AK is TUALL OFFICE OF ACTOMATION OF THE COODS selection process. G.Sh. Yamalutdinova 173 One of the approaches to solving this problem for mathematical publications is considered in [4]. This work proposes an approach to solving the aforementioned problem based on the use of recommendation systems. The recommender of the system is a complex of software tools, which, on the basis of a semantic analysis of the document, forms a list of recommendations [5]. It should be noted that recently, recommendation systems have begun to work with scientific content, which is primarily associated with a significant increase in the volume of scientific information [6]. The proposal of the algorithm of automatic selection of classification codes of UDC, based on the use of lexemes received from the name of the work, and the list of keywords indicated by the author in the work. The algorithm consists of the following steps: Step 1. keywords are distinguished from the article. Step 2. The name of the article is divided into lexemes. Step 3. Equivalence classes are formed for lexemes allocated from the name. Step 4. Search in the classifier dictionary and the recommended list of codes is generated. Step 5. Based on the user’s choice, the final list of classifiers is formed. The language of presentation of classification codes in the form of an XML file has been developed. The set of these codes is converted into XML format. In the future, it is also supposed to use the JSON-reproduction of the list of codes. The algorithm is implemented in the form of a web service based on the Open Server platform. The HTML language is used for the web form, for the LA Service-JavaScript and PHP. The user is provided by the form with the fields for entering the name of the article and the key 174 g. Yamalutdinov words. The system is tested at the collections of physical and mathematical publications from the magazines Izvestia universities. Matem Tika ”and“ Scientific Notes of Kazan University.
