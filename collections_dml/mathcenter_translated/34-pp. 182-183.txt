. Methods of boundary integral equations in the calculations of electric fields in electrolytes A. A. Rumyantsev Bashkir State University, Ufa, Allarum@mail.ru in the work model the stationary process of the electric power of the metal in the diluted electrolyte solution. Matical model is formulated in the form of a regional task for the Laplace equation regarding the potential of an electric field in the volume of the electrolyte in which the OMA Law is implemented, with the exception of diffusion emergency layers. Grace of the electrodes are based on the equations of electrochemical kinetics, the equations of diffusion kinetics and the ratios that determine the complete polarization of the electro -dov: ja (p) = j 0 a (EXP (αazf RT ηA) CA CA C0 - EXP ( - (1 - αA ) ZF RT ηA)), p ∈ SA; jk (p) = j 0 k (αkzf rt ηk) - - exp ( - (1 - αk) ZF RT ηK) ck c0), p ∈ SK; CA = C 0 + JA (1 - Ta) ΔA zfda, p ∈ SA; ck = c 0 + jk (1 - tk) Δk zfdk, p ∈ SK; ηa (p) = u –ea (p), p ∈ Sa; ηk (p) = —ek (p), p ∈ SK. Here j (p) - the function of current density at the border; J0e, αe - parameters determined by experimental data; Z is the charge of Jonah; te - the number of transfer; De - the coefficients of the Diffh of ZII; δe - the thickness of the diffusion layer; C 0, CE is the concentration of ions; ηe - overvoltage of electrodes; EE - the potential of the electrode Tall; E (p) - boundary potential. For a solution, a scheme based on the method of boundary elements is proposed. The boundary integral equation E (p) = 1 k (p) ∫ s (q) ∂g (p, q) ∂n + j (q) g (p, q) σ) ds, which is solved by the numerical method, is built. 185
