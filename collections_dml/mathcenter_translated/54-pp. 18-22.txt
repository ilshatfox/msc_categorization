Vodopyanov1  1 vodopis@math.nsc.ru; Sobolev Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences  We define a two-index scale of mappings with θ-weighted (q, p)-distortion. The qoal of the paper is to show that the mappings of a new class inherit many properties of mappings with bounded distortion. In addition, homeomorphic maps of this class for θ ≡ 1, n − 1 ≤ q < p = n can be considered as admissible deformations in problems of the non-linear theory of elasticity.  Keywords: outer and inner distortion, pullback operator of differential forms, mapping with bounded θ-weighted (q, p)-distortion, Poleckĭi function, capacity.  1. It is known that in the theory of mappings with bounded distortion both outer and inner distortion coefficients are used. In some cases, it does not matter which one to apply (see, for instance, [1, Corollary 3]). However, it should be borne in mind that the outer distortion characterises the geometric properties of the direct mapping, while the behaviour of the inner distortion reflects the geometric properties of the inverse mapping.  Relationship between these values is set in the following theorem. To formulate it we introduce the following objects:  1) non-negative locally integrable functions θ,ω :Rn → (0,∞) (referred to beweighted); 2) for n×n-matrix A, the symbol adj A denotes an adjoint matrix, defined by the con dition A adj A = I det A if the determinant of A is different of zero, and by the continuity in the topology of Rn×n otherwise;  3) for numbers n − 1 ≤ q ≤ p < ∞ and a mapping ϕ : Ω → Rn, Ω ⊂ Rn, of Sobolev class W 1  1,loc (Ω), we define the (inner) operator distortion function:  Ω ∋ x 7→K θ,1q,p (x,ϕ) =    θ  n−1 q (x)|adjDϕ(x)| |J (x,ϕ)|  n−1 p  at x ∈Ω\ Z , 0 otherwise.  (1)  Hereinafter, Z = {x ∈Ω : J (x,ϕ) = 0}; 4) for a mapping ψ :Ω′ →Rn, Ω′ ⊂Rn, of Sobolev class W 1  1,loc (Ω′) we define the (outer)  operator distortion function:  Ω′ ∋ y 7→ K 1,ωs,r (y,ψ) =    |Dψ(y)| ω(y)  1 r |J (y,ψ)| 1r  at y ∈Ω′ \ Z ′, 0 otherwise,  (2)  here n −1 < s ≤ r ≤∞. The value (1) is a generalisation of the inner distortion coefficient well-known in the  quasiconformal analysis, and (2) generalises the outer distortion coefficient. From [1, Theorem 3] and [2, Theorem 1.2] we deduce the following result:  Theorem 1. Let the homeomorphism ϕ :Ω→Ω′ have the following properties:    S.K. Vodopyanov 19  1) ϕ ∈W 1 q,loc  (Ω), n −1 ≤ q <∞, 2) ϕ has the finite codistortion: adjDϕ(x) = 0 a. e. on the set Z , 3) K θ,1q,p (·,ϕ) ∈ Lϱ(Ω) where 1ϱ = n−1q − n−1p , n −1 < q < p <∞.  Then 4) the mapping ϕ :Ω→Ω′ induces a bounded pull-back operator ϕ∗ : L p  n−1 (Ω′,Λn−1) →  L q n−1 ,θ  (Ω,Λn−1) of L p n−1 -forms of degree n −1 into the weighted space L q  n−1 ,θ (Ω,Λn−1) of  forms of degree n −1; 5) the inverse homeomorphism ϕ−1 ∈W 1  s,loc (Ω′) where s = pp−n+1 ,  6) ϕ−1 has the finite distortion: Dϕ−1(y) = 0 a. e. on Z ′, 7) K 1,ωs,r (·,ϕ−1) ∈ Lϱ(Ω′) where r = qq−n+1 , s =  p p−n+1 , ω= θ  − n−1q−(n−1) ◦ϕ−1. 8) the homeomorphismϕ−1 induces a bounded operatorϕ−1∗ : L1r (Ω  ′;ω)∩W 1∞,loc → L1s (Ω) by the composition rule. Furthermore, ∥ϕ−1∗∥ ≤ ∥K 1,ωs,r (·,ϕ−1) | Lϱ(Ω′)∥ = ∥K θ,1q,p (·,ϕ) | Lϱ(Ω)∥. 2. The last assertion motivates the definition of the next class of mappings.  Definition 1. A mapping f : Ω→ Rn is called the mapping with bounded θ-weighted (q, p)-distrotion (belongs to the class ID(Ω; q, p;θ,1)) n −1 ≤ q ≤ p <∞, if:  1) f is continuous, open and discrete; 2) f belongs to Sobolev class W 1  q,loc (Ω);  3) the Jacobian J (x, f ) ≥ 0 in Ω almost everywhere; 4) the mapping f has the finite codistortion; 5) the function of the local θ-weighted (q, p)-distortion  Ω ∋ x 7→K θ,1q,p (x, f ) =    θ  1 q (x)|adjD f (x)|  J (x, f ) n−1  p , if J (x, f ) ̸= 0,  0 otherwise (3)  belongs to Lϱ(Ω) where ϱ is found from the condition 1 ϱ = n−1q − n−1p (ϱ=∞ at q = p).  We introduce the following notation K θ,1q,p ( f ;Ω) = ∥∥K θ,1q,p (·, f ) | Lϱ(Ω)∥∥.  We note that condition 2 of this definition can be relaxed. Following the paper [3, P. 265] by E. Poleckĭi, for continuous open and discrete mapping  f :Ω→Rn preserving orientation, and normal domain D bΩ, on the image V = f (D) we define Poleckĭi function gD : V →Rn as  V ∋ y 7→ gD (y) =Λ ∑  x∈ f −1(y)∩D i (x, f )x where Λ ∈ (0,∞). (4)  The function of the form (4) was introduced by E. Poletskĭi in [3] for the mappings with bounded distortion.  Properties Poletskĭi function are formulated in the following statement.  Theorem 2 [4]. Suppose that a continuous open and discrete mapping f belongs W 1  q,loc (Ω;Rn), q > n − 1, detD f (x) ≥ 0, and f has the finite codistortion: adjD f (x) = 0  on Z = {x ∈Ω : J (x, f ) = 0} almost everywhere (or f ∈ID(Ω;n −1,n;1,1) ). Then    20 МАТЕРИАЛЫ МЕЖДУНАРОДНОЙ ШКОЛЫ-КОНФЕРЕНЦИИ  1) f is sense-preserving, 2) function gD , defined by the
