Ryutin1 1 kriutin@yahoo.com; Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov in the work discusses the possibility of constructing integer measurements with small elements and the speed of operation of recovery algorithms is evaluated. Key words: restoration of vectors, integer measurement matrices. The task of restoring the integrated rarefied vector according to a small number of linear measurements, closely related to the theory of compressed measurements (see, for example, [1]) is considered. The problems of the restoration of vectors on linear dimensions set by integer matrices were probably the first to consider L. Fukshansky, D. Nidell and B. Sudakov in [2]. We fix the designations and give some definitions. The equation y = AX is considered, where A is the integer M × D Matrix (we will call it a measurement matrix). Under | A | It is understood to be the maximum of the modules of the elements of the matrix A = (AI J), the vector X is supposed to be S - fissored, that is, its carrier has a power S, and m = max | x j |. The main issues are: when can you build an integer M × D Matrix A such that any S -detailed vector x ∈ZD can be unambiguously restored according to the Ax vector? Such a matrix will be called good (or s - good). How small can the elements of such a matrix be made? Present the recovery algorithm and evaluate its complexity. We describe the known results: in [2] it is shown that for the matrix of a ∈ ZM × D, which | A | ≤ k, and all (m × m)-submits have a full rank in a necessary condition D = O (K2M). Similar matrices provide the uniqueness of the restoration of vectors at s ≤ m/2. The existence of such matrices by the authors [2] is proved by d = ω (p km). These results were significantly improved in the work [3], [5]. More precisely, in [5] it is proved that with large K, for the existence of the above matrix, it is necessary that d ≤ 100k √ logkm at m ≥ logk and d ≤ 400km/(m - 1) m3/2 at 2 ≤ m <logk. Of the known hypotheses regarding the properties of random matrices, it follows that with M ≥ Logk this rating is close to optimal. In addition, in the work of S.V. Konyagina and B. Sudakova [5] proposed a very natural design of the matrix A C | A | ≤ k, in which everything (m × m)-submissions have a full rank in the assumptions M <d ≤ max (k +1, km/(m-1)/2. The question of effective K.S. Ryutin 287 Actually recovery algorithm It was not considered. Let φ = φm × p - a matrix of elements φi j ∈Z, where φi j = k j i -1 (mod p), 1 ≤ j ≤ p, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, p is a simple number and m ≤ p , k j - fixed integers of 1 ≤ k j <p (thereby, a certain representative of the deduction class for each element of the matrix was recorded). It was this design that was considered in [5], while the elements were selected so that | φi j | ≤ p1−1−1-1-1-1-1 /m. We want to restore the vector x ∈ ZP, with non -equal coordinates (s ≤ m/2) according to this vector y = (y0,., ym -1) = φx ∈Zm. We do not know the value of S and evaluation We carry out the complexity of the algorithm in terms M, P, M = Max | X j | It is known that for O (tω) operations in the final field F you can solve the given T × T system of linear heterogeneous equations, where the best known ω <2.4. B. [4] proved theorem. There are determiners an algorithm that allows you to find according to the vector y Vector X ZAO (Mω Logp M+M2+O (1) P1/2+O (1)) of arithmetic operations in the FP and ZAO (M2 LOGP M) Operations in the ring. Calculations are made with numbers not large in module than max {m p, max j | y j |+mp1−1/m}. There is a natural desire to build good measurements matrices with as lower elements as possible. Prepint is devoted to this issue [6]. For example, the Boolery matrices. It turns out that there is a simple design that, according to the set m × D integral matrix A and the number z ∈N, 2 ≤ z <| a | builds (mr) × D Matrix ã with | ã | <z, where R = [logz | a |] +1. At the same time, it is true (see [6]) sentence 1. Let the integerm × D Matrix A and algorithmic composition is given, which finds any integer vector X ∈ZD with the size of the size of no more than the well -known Ax. Then there is an algorithm that allows you to restore the vector X by ỹ = ã and at the same time the complexity of the (MR) arithmetic operations in Z with numbers that do not exceed ∥ỹ∥و | A |. The investigation. When large and any S ≤ c1n /log n, the matrix × n matrix with unambiguous restoration of any vectors from the carrier of power is no more than s. In addition, using the generalization of the design of the matrix, the case of the FPR field was shown that it was completed (see [6]) Drying 2. For any simple number P and numbers R, s ∈ N, S <PR /2, there is an integer matrix φ size ( r (2s - 1) + 1) × p
