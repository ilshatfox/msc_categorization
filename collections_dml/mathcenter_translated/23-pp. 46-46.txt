) Summarized-design models and recursive hierarchies in this work examine machine-oracular modeling of second-order arithmetic and some of its fragments, as well as fragments of the axiomatic theory of sets close to them. This means the construction of generalized design models that consist of objects calculated with some oracle. In this work: 1. Through a generalization of the pulsating process proposed by N.V. Belyakin, such an ordinal numbering is built that the totality of m | ν | ν total functions, computable with the ilistered clinian oracle H | ν | ν, E1, forms a model of arithmetic second order. 2. Such autonomous relative to E2 (hyper-hyper-jump) is built that the totality of m | µ | µ of total functions gives a model for a two-quarter fragment of second-order arithmetic. 3. It is proved that no E2-autonomous numbering does not give a model of all second-order arithmetic. L and T R A T R A 1. Gylit E.V.
