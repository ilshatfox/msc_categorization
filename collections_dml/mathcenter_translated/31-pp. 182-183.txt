Local controllability of the system of differential equations of M.V. Yukhanov Ryazan State Pedagogical University named after S. A. Yesenina, dma@rspu.ryazan.ru The system of ordinary differential equations ẋ = a (t) x + b (t) u + f (t, x, u), (1) where x ∈ Rn, u is considered ∈ Rm-control, a (t)-(n × n)-brisk, b (t)-(n × m)-brisk, m <n, t ∈ [0, t], matrices A (t), b (t) continuous on [0, t], f (t, x, u)-N-dimensional vector-function. Denote | Y | = max 1≤i≤k {| yi |}, where y = (y1, y2, ..., yk); ‖B (.) ‖ = Sup tgr [0, t] ‖b (t) ‖; ‖B‖ = sup | z | <1 | bz | , B - matrix; H (δ0) = {(t, x, u): t ∈ [0, t], x ∈ Rn, u ∈ Rm, | x | ≤ Δ0, | u | ≤ Δ0}, W (Δ0) = {α ∈ RN: | α | ≤ Δ0}, number Δ0> 0. As acceptable controls, we will consider continuous on the segment [0, t] functions U (t) that satisfy the condition | U (·) | ≤ Δ0. The set of all permissible managements denote U (Δ0). Let the function F (t, x, u) satisfies the condition of the lips of the alternating X and U on the set H (Δ0). It is assumed that the system (1) satisfies the conditions of existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence of the solution on the initial data and the parameter. We denote the solution of the system (1) with the initial condition x (0) = α, which corresponds to the control of u ∈ U (δ0), as follows: t 7 → x = x (t, α, u), x (0, α, u) = α. 182 Definition. We will call the system (1) locally controlled, if there is such a number Δ> 0 that for any vector α ∈ W (Δ) are found U ∈ U (δ) and T> 0 that the solution of the system (1) satisfies equality X ( T, α, u (t)) = 0. The task is set: to determine the conditions under which the system (1) is locally controlled. We will look for control in the form of u (t) = D (t) c, where D (t) is a well-known (m × n)-brings, C is an unknown N-dimensional vector. It has been established that during the assumptions, the question of local control of the system (1) is reduced to the resolution of the operator equation α + PC + O (| γ |) = 0, (2) where p = t∫ 0 x -1 (t) b (t) b (t (t) b (t) b (t (t) b (t) ) D (t) dt-(n × n)-brisk, γ = (α, c). The operator equation is considered in 2 cases: non -ritis, when Rankp = N, and critical, when Rankp = R, 0 <r <n. For each case, theorems about local controllability are formulated and proved. 183
