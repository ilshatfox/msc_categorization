Solving one generalized problem of the gazeman type for bianalytic functions in the parabolic case, if+ - the final single -link area on the plane of the complex alternating z = x+ iy, limited by a simple smooth closed contour L. through T - denote the addition of T+ ∪L to a complete comprehensive plane. The following task is considered (see also [1]). It is required to find all the piece of bonalytic functions f (z) = {f+(z), f - (z)} class A2 (t ±) ∩H (2) (l), f+(0) = 0, f - (∞) = 0, satisfying on L the next regional conditions: ∂f +[α (t)] ∂x2–k∂yk - 1 = gk1 (t) ∂f - (t) ∂x2–k∂yk -1 + +gk2 (t ) ∂f - (t) ∂x2–k∂yk - 1 + gk (t), k = 1, 2, (1) where gkj (t), gk (t) (k = 1, 2; j = 1 , 2) - the functions set on L satisfy the Helder condition along with their derivatives up to about 3 - k inclusive, and GKJ (t) 6 = 0 on l, α (t) - preserves orientation of the homeomorphism of the contour l on itself, and α ′ (t) 6 = 0 on L. is known (see, for example, [1]) that any piece of bonalytic function with a line of jumps l can be represented in the form of f (z) = {f+(z) = onic+0 (z ) + z̄wor + 1 (z), z ∈ T +, f - (z) = ∗ - 0 (z) + z̄ç - 1 (z), z ∈ T -, (2) where ventral (z), ∗ +1 (z) (gment - 0 (z), ∗ - 1 (z)) - analytical in t +(t -) functions called the analytical components of the bianalytic function f +(z) (f - (z)). In this message using the presentation (2) it is established that if | GK1 (t) | ≡ | gk2 (t) |, k = 1, 2 (a parabolic case for the problem (1)), then the solution of the problem in question is reduced to solving the two problems of Hilbert (internal and 15 external) and the marginal problem of the gazeman with integral members regarding the piece of analytical functions .
