) Small isperimetric inequalities for the Euclidean moments of the region regarding the border The main result of the work is to clarify the isoperimetric inequalities from work [1] in the class of polygons with a fixed number of parties. It is well known that the classic isperimetric inequality between the area of ​​the region and its long border is specified for N - squares. In particular, classic isperimetric inequality can be obtained by the ultimate transition. A large number of classic and new small isoperimetric inequalities can be found in an article -review [2]. The work considers isperimetric inequalities for the new geometric functionals of the region, which were 92 in connection with a bilateral assessment of physical functionality - the rigidity of the region’s power (see [3]). Let G - a single -link area on the plane. Geometric functionality I (α, G): = ∫∫ g Distα (Z, ∂G) DX DY is called the Euclidean moment of the region relative to the border of the order α. Here is Dist (Z, ∂g) - the distance from the point Z = x + iy ∈ G to the boundary of this area ∂g and α> −1. The polygon is called described if each of its sides touches the circle. Theorem. Let G - the described N - the bang. Then I (α, g) ≤ I (α, g ∗), where g ∗ is the correct N -angle of the same area as G. The resulting isoperimetric inequality is a direct analogue of the classical inequality of Saint -Venan - Polya P (G) ≤ a 2 (G) 2π, where P (G) is the rigidity of the single -legged area G.
