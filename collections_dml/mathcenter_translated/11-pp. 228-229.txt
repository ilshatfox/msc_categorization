One generalization of a non -kerful regional task for a degenerate hyperbolic equation we consider the equation 2P UXX - uyy - -uy = 0, o o <2P <1, (1) in the area D, limited to interval (O, 1) and characteristics of AS: x +y = O; BC: x -U = 1 equation (1), Nunning from points A (O, O), B (L, O) and intersecting at point C (~ .- ~). Let 80 (x) and 81 (x) affixes of the intersection of the character of the equation (1) emerging from the points (: 1.:, O) E with the characteristics of the AC and Sun, respectively.

Using the solution to the problem of the Koshi problem for hurricths (1), we will write out and [8o) and [81 (x)] [4]: ​​and [8u (x)] = "(1g (p) (c) (c;: · p; -lt) (h;) -"(2g (l -p) (1j+1 '· 2p -l, p -LV) (x), and [81 (x)] =" (1g (p) (if) (if) ~, p-lt) (x)-72g (l-p) (1: = p · 2p-l, p-lv) (x), where t (x) = and (x, o), g (2r ) 'Y1 = g2 (p), v (x) = lim 0 0 (-y) 2puy (x, y), u-+ - 22p -1 g (l - 2p)' y2 - g2 (1 - p) .
