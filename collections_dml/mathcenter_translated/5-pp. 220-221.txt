) Integral formulas of the type of package with the second appel function examine integral formulas such as a package for the function of appel F2 (A :, F31, /32; 11, 12; x, y). Formulas from 220 miles of pairs of parameters ({31,! 32) and (')' 1, ')' 2) were obtained. Based on the integration of the radio presentation for F2 [1] and the above formulas on the beam, an analogue of the formula of the Beitman formula with hypergeometric function of the Gauss VC52-L (1-VP2-82-L.
