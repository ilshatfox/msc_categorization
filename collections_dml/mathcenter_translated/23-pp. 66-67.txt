) Algebras over the Opead of the graphs, let G (N) are many symmetrical n × n-matrices, the components of which belong to the two-element boulevium algebra {0, 1}. The elements of this set are the matrix of the adjacency of graphs (possibly with loops) without multiple ribs. We also determine the component G (0), consisting of an empty matrix, which corresponds to a column without vertices. By analogy with [1], we determine the operation of the composition G (m) × g (n1) ×. . . G (NM) → G (N1 +.. + NM) is as follows: AB1. . . BM =   A11 + B1 A12. . . A1M A21 A22 + B2. . . A2M ... .... . . ... am1 am2. . . amm + bm  , where aij = aijjninj, jninj is the ni × nj size matrix consisting of units; AII + BI - a matrix obtained from BI adding AII to each BI element. Theorem 1. Regarding the introduced operation of the composition g = {g (n) | n ≥ 1} is an operation with a single element - matrix (0). The GAR of the G is also an EPI-Operation (in the sense of [2]) and is generated (as an EPI Operation) with a graph of two peaks connected by one rib, and an empty graph of two peaks. Theorem 2. The diversity of the algebra over the GLG (G) Opead (G) is rationally equivalent to the variety of algebra with two binary operations of the 68 zhenya, multiplication and constant θ, satisfying the following ten identities: a1 + a2 = a2 + a1, a1 · a2 = a2 · a1, a1 +θ = a1, a1 · θ = a1, (a1 +a2) +a3 = a1 +(A2 +A3), (A1 · A2) · A3 = A1 · (A2 · A3), A +A, A, A, A, A, A, A, a · a · a = a · a, a1 · (A2 +A3) = A1 · A2 +A1 · A3, A1 · A2 · A1 · A2 +A2 · A3 +A1 · A3.

Stukachev (Novosibirsk, Aistu@math.nsc.ru) about models allowed in the permissible sets for arbitrary permissible set A discusses the concepts of permitted (limitedly permitted, calculated) in the algebraic system. It is shown that if the M 1-percussion system in HF (M), then in HF (M) there is a universal σ-function and fair principle of reduction, but the principle of uniformization is not always carried out. There is a theorem 1. Let M 1-percussion in HF (M). Then HF (M) has the property of uniforms in that case, when some existential cheekbone enrichment of the M system M is calculated in HF (M). A description of the permitted models permitted in the HF and supervisors, generalizing the Nurtazin theorem [1]. Theorem 2. For the computable system m and n ≤ ω, the following conditions are equivalent: 1) m n-percussion in HF (M); 2) for any n 'm n n-percussion relative to D (n); 69
