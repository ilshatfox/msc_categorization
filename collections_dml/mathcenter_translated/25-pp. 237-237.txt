The structure of the solutions of the system of differential equations with delay is considered the system of differential equations X (t) = a (t) x (t) + b (t, l) x (h (t)) + f (t, x (t), x (x (x h (t)), l), (1) where x e d (bo) = {x/ x e en, lxl ~ bo}, bo> o, parameter l e l (bo) = {l/ l e En , Ili ~ bo}, a (t), b (t, l) - continuous on many [o, w] and [o, w] x l (bo), respectively (n x n) matrix, f (t, x, y, l, t)-continuous on the set W (bo) = = [o, w] x d (B.) x D (b0) x l (b0) P-dimensional vector-function, h (t) vector that satisfies the conditions: 1) if h (t) <o, then h (t) = a; 2) if h (t)> o, then h (t) = b, where a and b-fixed vectors, and e [minh (t), o), ะก (maxw, h (t)]. [O , w) [o, w) theorem. Let the vector-function f (t, x, y, l, t) satisfy the condition of the Linshitz on the set W (Bo). Then the solution of the system (1) can be represented by equality x (t, a, l) = f (t, a, b, l) a + ip (t, a, b, a, l), + oo where f (t, a, b, l) = 2: Fr (t, a, b, l) - continuous (php) -brutal, r = o f (t, a, b, l) = x (t), Fr (t, t, t, fr a, b, l) = x (t) x x j; x-1 (() b ((, l) FR-I (H ((), A, B, L) D (, (R = 1.2, ...); +OO IP (t, a, a, a, b, a, l) = lfpr (t, a, b, a, l) r = o-continuous P-dimensional vector-function, ipo (t, a, b, a, l) = x (t) fot x -1 (() j ((, x (, a, l), x (h (()), a, l) d (, fpr (t, a, b, a, l) = x (t) FOT X- 1 (() b ((, l) IPR-I (H ((), A, B, A, L) D ((R = 1.2,..). 237.
