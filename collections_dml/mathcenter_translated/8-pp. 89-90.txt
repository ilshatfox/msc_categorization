One equality for conjugated harmonic functions, let G - a single -link area, the border of which ∂g is a Zhordan analytical curve. With a fixed z ∈ G through uction (z; ζ), we denote any conformal one-leaf display of the region G on a single circle ∆ with the condition ivil (z; z) = 0. For the final set of points λ = {z1, ..., zn } ⊂ g with ζ & µλ (ζ) = ∣∣∣∣ d arg φλ (ζ) d ζ ∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣ = n∑ k = 1 ∣∣∣∣ d ∗ (zk; ζ) d ζ ∣∣∣∣. 89 Theorem 1. Let f (z) = u (z) + IV (Z) - a function, analytical in ḡ, α - arbitrary material number and ζj = ζj (α) ∈g - solutions of the equation φλ (ζ) - eiα = 0. Then at each point zk ∈ λ the value u (zk) is equal to the expression n∑ j = 1 u (ζj) | therg (zk; ζj) | µλ (ζj) + 1 2π ∫ ∂g v (ζ) | onic (zk; ζ) | ctg α - β (ζ) 2 | d ζ | . (1) Integral B (1) is understood in the sense of the main value of Koshi. In a particular case, f (z) = 1 from here we find n∑ j = 1 | therg (zk; ζj) | µ - 1λ (ζj) = 1 for all k. From (1) and from the variational principle of Lindelef, the theorem 2. Let ²> 0, λ = {z1, ..., zn} ⊂ G and the inequality of SUP {| µλ (ζ1) −µλ (ζ2) |: ζ1, ζ2 ∈ ∂G} ≤ ². Let ρ - Euclidean distance between the sets λ and ∂g. Then ρ ≥ (² + 2πn/mes1∂g) −1. The work was supported by the Russian Federation (projects 99-01-00119 and 00-01-00341). V.V. Dmitrieva (Ufa) Point transformations and Penleva equations is well known that the next class of differential equations of the second order y ′ ′ = p (x, y) + 3q (x, y) y ′ + 3r (x, y) (y ′) 2 + S (x, y) (y ′) 3 (1) is closed relatively unpertured point transformations. This made it possible to build an effective classification of equations (1) in the work in [1].
