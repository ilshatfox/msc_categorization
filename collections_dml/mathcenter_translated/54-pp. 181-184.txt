Keywords: Beltra equation, the edge of the leap task, β-analytical functions. 182 Materials of the International School-Conference Consider the equation by the underwear ∂φ = µ∂φ, | µ (z) | <1, where ∂: = 1 2 (∂ ∂x + i ∂ ∂y), ∂: = 1 2 (∂ ∂x - i ∂y). It is a generalization of the equation of Koshha-Riman ∂φ = 0 and has a large number of applications, see e.g., [1–3]. In 1985, A.B. Tungatarov [4] investigated this equation at µ (z) = β (z/z), 0 ≤β <1, and established the following analogue of the cat formula for the solutions of this equation: φ (z) = 1 2 (1–β) πi ˆ γ φ (ζ) dζ ζ - z | z/ζ | θ + β 2 (1–β) π γ ζφ (ζ) dζ ζ (ζ - z | z/ζ | θ), where θ = 2β/2β/ (1–β), γ is a closed smooth curve that limits a certain flat area. Then, in articles [5–9], regional tasks were studied for continuously differentiated solutions of this equation, called β-analytical functions; The task of the jump and the task of Riman on closed curves were solved. Here we are studying the task of a jump for β-analytical functions on the jordan arches. Let γ - oriented smooth arc starting at point T1 and ending at point t2, γ ′ = γ \ {t1, t2} and 0 ̸∈ γ. We are looking for the β-analytical function φ (z) such that at each point t ∈ γ ′ it has the limiting values ​​on the left and right, satisfying the ratio φ+(t) –φ-(t) = f (t), t ∈ γ ′, (1) with a given function f (t). In addition, it is required that the company = 0 and at the end points of the arc the ratio φ (z) = o (| z - t j | –α j), z → t j, α j = α J (φ) <1 , j = 1.2. (2) For the case β = 0, the task of jumping on smooth arcs has been studied, and its solution is well known, see, e.g., [10, 11]. The main apparatus here is an integral of the Koshi type. In this work, we use its analogue φ (z) = cβ γ (f; z): = 1 2 (1–β) πi γ γ f (ζ) ζ - z | z/ζ | θ (dζ+ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ ζ /ζ) dζ). (3) Such an integral, taken by a closed curve, was studied in [5–7]. We note some properties of integral in (3). Lemma 1. If the integral in (3) exists, then the right part of this equality determines the β-analytical function in C \ γ, which turns into zero at infinity. We denote the class of functions through Ha (γ) that satisfy the condition of the Helder with the indicator ν, ν ∈ (0; 1]. B.A. Katz, S.R. Mironova, A.Yu. Pogodin 183 Lemma 2. If the function f (t (t ) ∈ Ha (γ), then the function φ, determined by equality (3), has the ultimate values ​​on the left and right φ ± (t) at any point t γ ′, satisfying equality (1). Note that the display Z 7 → Z | z | θ is mutually unambiguous. It is bilipshitsevo on each compact subservience of the plane. Not containing the beginning of the coordinates. We denote through γ̃ the image of the arc γ while display. Lemma 3. If the function of f (t) ∈ Ha (γ), then in the vicinity of the end of the ar columns Φ, determined in (3), has the following behavior: φ (z) = f (t j) 2 (1–β) πi ln z̃ - t̃2 z̃ - t̃1 + c j + o (1), j = 1.2, where C J - constants, and the logarithm branch is determined by a section along γ̃. Based on Lemm 1-3, theorem is proved. Function tail (z) = cβ γ (f; z) is the only solution to the task of leap (1) - (2) on the smooth arc γ that satisfying the equation of the underwear ∂ φ = β (z/z) ∂φ and turning to zero at infinity.
