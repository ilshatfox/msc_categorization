) Special linear and projective analytical devices of the projective space will assign the projective space PN to the mobile repera {AG} (I '.J', K '= O, "" N). Derivational formulas have the form:; · DA 1. = w 1 · A; where D is the sign of ordinary differentiation. We will produce these formulas external, using the completeness of the differentials of the enzymes DA 1 ·: D (DAG) = O, where D- symbol of the external Differentials of losing. We receive structural equations Doo {"= oo ~ · l С ~ · line group GL (n+ 1), which acts ineffective in the space p n · from the group GL (n+ 1) an effective specialized linear group SGL (N +l) using the equality of OO :: = o, it is called a condition for the equi -projectivity (in essence, the condition of the project). This special linear apparatus is not always convenient: a) about the effect space PN is a generalization! '>. ·! afford spaces AN, but structural equations of the Astfine GA (N), which are in the space of the ANTRA (N) do not follow the equations of the SGL (N-I-1) group; b) when limiting the special linear Appal of the PN space for subspace PM, whether the neutral apparatus is obtained, in other words, when the SGL group (N+ 1) operates in the space of P11, the GL (M-T-1) group acts in the subspace P M). The projective analytical apparatus, deprived of the indicated deficiency of 1 · 1 · O KV, is built using basic forms 8 j "CO; · - o; · · · С О a projective group GP (n), the isomorphic group SGL (n+ 1). Highlighting the value About the index g = {o, i} (l, j, k = l, ..., n) and lowering it in forms 8 ~, 8 ~, from the structural equations of the group GL (n+ 1) we will find the equations of the GP group ( n) 00 1 = ej /\ e ~, de ~ = e ~ /\ e ~ + ek /\ (-8 ~ 1 eko - oko;), d81 = e ~ /\ e J. This device is suitable for describing strata Above the space of P ", for example, the theorem is fair. Projective pneummark PN. considered as: 1) the space of points, is a codonal. 2) The space of hyperpravka is a smooth smooth (more precisely, affinant). 303
