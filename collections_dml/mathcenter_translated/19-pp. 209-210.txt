) The properties of local single -leafful functions represented by structural formulas following the idea of ​​work [1], we introduce and take off the classes of pupilly conformal display, generated by the functions of classes S or E and the functions of the class of karateodori C. 209 1. The symbol S [a,; 3] denote the class of display One round circle d, the elements of which are represented in the form where r, f e s, a, {3 - numerical parameters. It is assumed that under the sign of the integral there are appropriate unambiguous vetes of the degrees of functions P and F, taking values ​​of 1 at the beginning of the coordinates. With real A and /3 ;:::: Theorems about the distortion are proven. A generalized constant Kebe K (a, {3) for class S [a,; 3], that is, the radius of the greatest open circle with the center at point F (O), which is entirely contained in any one-man-sized riman surface F (D, was found ) each function F E S [A, B]: {1 (1 - R) L <> L+. In (A, {3) = JO (1+R) Lol+Z.V D R. At /3 = 1, the value of this constant is 1 /(4 + 2 la!). With non -negative A and {3, the variant of the theorems of the doctors was obtained and the assessments of the initial Taylor coefficients in the class S [a, /3] were found. 2. The relevant issues are considered for the class ё [o :,! Z] of the prototypes W (() = / [p (l / ()] 0 [r.p '(()], ZD (defined in the field of D • = {(E C:! (!> 1}. The functions of R.P E I:, P. In particular, the design of generalized Faber polynomas, which are raised with local conformal display W e F: [a, 8, is taken as generators. ]. Work support of the RFFIF (project 01- 01-00112).
