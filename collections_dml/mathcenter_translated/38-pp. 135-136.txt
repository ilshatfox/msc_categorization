The compactness of the Sobolevian investments in metric spaces with a measure let (x, d) is a limited metric space with a regular Borelev measure µ, associated with D Condition of the order of the order 'y> o> o: µb (x, s) ~ cs-utte- , t), x e x, o <t ~ s. Here in (x, t) = {u x: d (x, y) <t} - a ball with a center at point x e x radius t> o. Let P - a class of increasing functions' t/: (o, 1 ] ---> (O, 1], for which 17 ( +O) = O and 71 (T) T-A decreases at a certain A> O. for 7/ e P, we determine the maximum operator. 1 1!

Here we give conditions for the compactness of these investments. 136 century. AND . Ivanov, L! Ll yonoping theorem 1. empty 1 <q <q <oo, ry is determined by equality (1).
